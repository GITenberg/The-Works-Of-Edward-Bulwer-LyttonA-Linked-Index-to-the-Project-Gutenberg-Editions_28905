    <h3>
      &mdash;SHOWING HOW MY NOVEL CAME TO BE WRITTEN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Scene, the hall in UNCLE ROLAND'S tower; time, night; season, winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON is seated before a great geographical globe, which he is
      turning round leisurely, and "for his own recreation," as, according to
      Sir Thomas Browne, a philosopher should turn round the orb of which that
      globe professes to be the representation and effigies. My mother having
      just adorned a very small frock with a very smart braid, is holding it out
      at arm's length, the more to admire the effect. Blanche, though leaning
      both hands on my mother's shoulder, is not regarding the frock, but
      glances towards PISISTRATUS, who, seated near the fire, leaning back in
      the chair, and his head bent over his breast, seems in a very bad humour.
      Uncle Roland, who has become a great novel-reader, is deep in the
      mysteries of some fascinating Third Volume. Mr. Squills has brought the
      "Times" in his pocket for his own special profit and delectation, and is
      now bending his brows over "the state of the money market," in great doubt
      whether railway shares can possibly fall lower,&mdash;for Mr. Squills,
      happy man! has large savings, and does not know what to do with his money,
      or, to use his own phrase, "how to buy in at the cheapest in order to sell
      out at the dearest."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (musingly).&mdash;"It must have been a monstrous long journey.
      It would be somewhere hereabouts, I take it, that they would split off."
    </p>
    <p>
      MY MOTHER (mechanically, and in order to show Austin that she paid him the
      compliment of attending to his remarks).&mdash;"Who split off, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me, Kitty," said my father, in great admiration, "you ask just the
      question which it is most difficult to answer. An ingenious speculator on
      races contends that the Danes, whose descendants make the chief part of
      our northern population (and indeed, if his hypothesis could be correct,
      we must suppose all the ancient worshippers of Odin), are of the same
      origin as the Etrurians. And why, Kitty,&mdash;I just ask you, why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother shook her head thoughtfully, and turned the frock to the other
      side of the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, forsooth," cried my father, exploding,&mdash;"because the
      Etrurians called their gods the 'AEsar,' and the Scandinavians called
      theirs the 'AEsir,' or 'Aser'! And where do you think this adventurous
      scholar puts their cradle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cradle!" said my mother, dreamily, "it must be in the nursery."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Exactly,&mdash;in the nursery of the human race, just
      here," and my father pointed to the globe; "bounded, you see, by the river
      Halys, and in that region which, taking its name from Ees, or As (a word
      designating light or fire), has been immemorially called Asia. Now, Kitty,
      from Ees, or As, our ethnological speculator would derive not only Asia,
      the land, but AEsar, or Aser, its primitive inhabitants. Hence he supposes
      the origin of the Etrurians and the Scandinavians. But if we give him so
      much, we must give him more, and deduce from the same origin the Es of the
      Celt and the Ized of the Persian, and&mdash;what will be of more use to
      him, I dare say, poor man, than all the rest put together&mdash;the AEs of
      the Romans,&mdash;that is, the God of Copper-money&mdash;a very powerful
      household god he is to this day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother looked musingly at her frock, as if she were taking my father's
      proposition into serious consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So perhaps," resumed my father, "and not unconformably with sacred
      records, from one great parent horde came all those various tribes,
      carrying with them the name of their beloved Asia; and whether they
      wandered north, south, or west, exalting their own emphatic designation of
      'Children of the Land of Light' into the title of gods. And to think"
      (added Mr. Caxton pathetically, gazing upon that speck on the globe on
      which his forefinger rested),&mdash;"to think how little they changed for
      the better when they got to the Don, or entangled their rafts amidst the
      icebergs of the Baltic,&mdash;so comfortably off as they were here, if
      they could but have stayed quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why the deuce could not they?" asked Mr. Squills. "Pressure of
      population, and not enough to live upon, I suppose," said my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (sulkily).&mdash;"More probably they did away with the Corn
      Laws, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Papae!" quoth my father, "that throws a new light on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (full of his grievances, and not caring three straws about the
      origin of the Scandinavians).&mdash;"I know that if we are to lose L500
      every year on a farm which we hold rent-free, and which the best judges
      allow to be a perfect model for the whole country, we had better make
      haste and turn AEsir, or Aser, or whatever you call them, and fix a
      settlement on the property of other nations, otherwise, I suspect, our
      probable settlement will be on the parish."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS (who, it must be remembered, is an enthusiastic Free-trader).
      "You have only got to put more capital on the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Well, Mr. Squills, as you think so well of that
      investment, put your capital on it. I promise that you shall have every
      shilling of profit."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS (hastily retreating behind the "Times")&mdash;"I don't think
      the Great Western can fall any lower, though it is hazardous; I can but
      venture a few hundreds&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"On our land, Squills?&mdash;Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS.&mdash;"No, no,&mdash;anything but that; on the Great
      Western."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pisistratus relaxes into gloom. Blanche steals up coaxingly, and gets
      snubbed for her pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"There are two golden rules of life; one relates to the
      mind, and the other to the pockets. The first is, If our thoughts get into
      a low, nervous, aguish condition, we should make them change the air; the
      second is comprised in the proverb, 'It is good to have two strings to
      one's bow.' Therefore, Pisistratus, I tell you what you must do,&mdash;Write
      a book!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Write a book! Against the abolition of the Corn Laws?
      Faith, sir, the mischief's done! It takes a much better pen than mine to
      write down an act of parliament."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"I only said, 'Write a book.' All the rest is the
      addition of your own headlong imagination."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (with the recollection of The Great Book rising before him).&mdash;"Indeed,
      sir, I should think that that would just finish us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (not seeming to heed the interruption).&mdash;"A book that will
      sell; a book that will prop up the fall of prices; a book that will
      distract your mind from its dismal apprehensions, and restore your
      affection to your species and your hopes in the ultimate triumph of sound
      principles&mdash;by the sight of a favourable balance at the end of the
      yearly accounts. It is astonishing what a difference that little
      circumstance makes in our views of things in general. I remember when the
      bank in which Squills had incautiously left L1000 broke, one remarkably
      healthy year, that he became a great alarmist, and said that the country
      was on the verge of ruin; whereas you see now, when, thanks to a long
      succession of sickly seasons, he has a surplus capital to risk in the
      Great Western, he is firmly persuaded that England was never in so
      prosperous a condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS (rather sullenly).&mdash;"Pooh, pooh."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Write a book, my son,&mdash;write a book. Need I tell
      you that Money or Moneta, according to Hyginus, was the mother of the
      Muses? Write a book."
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANCHE and my MOTHER (in full chorus).&mdash;"O yes, Sisty, a book! a
      book! you must write a book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure," quoth my Uncle Roland, slamming down the volume he had just
      concluded, "he could write a devilish deal better book than this; and how
      I come to read such trash night after night is more than I could possibly
      explain to the satisfaction of any intelligent jury, if I were put into a
      witness-box, and examined in the mildest manner by my own counsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"You see that Roland tells us exactly what sort of a
      book it shall be."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Trash, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"No,&mdash;that is, not necessarily trash; but a book of
      that class which, whether trash or not, people can't help reading. Novels
      have become a necessity of the age. You must write a novel."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (flattered, but dubious).-"A novel! But every subject on which
      novels can be written is preoccupied. There are novels of low life, novels
      of high life, military novels, naval novels, novels philosophical, novels
      religious, novels historical, novels descriptive of India, the Colonies,
      Ancient Rome, and the Egyptian Pyramids. From what bird, wild eagle, or

</pre>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (after a little thought).&mdash;"You remember the story which
      Trevanion (I beg his pardon, Lord Ulswater) told us the other night? That
      gives you something of the romance of real life for your plot, puts you
      chiefly among scenes with which you are familiar, and furnishes you with
      characters which have been very sparingly dealt with since the time of
      Fielding. You can give us the country Squire, as you remember him in your
      youth; it is a specimen of a race worth preserving, the old idiosyncrasies
      of which are rapidly dying off, as the railways bring Norfolk and
      Yorkshire within easy reach of the manners of London. You can give us the
      old-fashioned Parson, as in all essentials he may yet be found&mdash;but
      before you had to drag him out of the great Tractarian bog; and, for the
      rest, I really think that while, as I am told, many popular writers are
      doing their best, especially in France, and perhaps a little in England,
      to set class against class, and pick up every stone in the kennel to shy
      at a gentleman with a good coat on his back, something useful might be
      done by a few good-humoured sketches of those innocent criminals a little
      better off than their neighbours, whom, however we dislike them, I take it
      for granted we shall have to endure, in one shape or another, as long as
      civilization exists; and they seem, on the whole, as good in their present
      shape as we are likely to get, shake the dice-box of society how we will."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Very well said, sir; but this rural country gentleman
      life is not so new as you think. There's Washington Irving&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Charming; but rather the manners of the last century
      than this. You may as well cite Addison and Sir Roger de Coverley."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"'Tremaine' and 'De Vere.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Nothing can be more graceful, nor more unlike what I
      mean. The Pales and Terminus I wish you to put up in the fields are
      familiar images, that you may cut out of an oak tree,&mdash;not beautiful
      marble statues, on porphyry pedestals, twenty feet high."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Miss Austen; Mrs. Gore, in her masterpiece of 'Mrs.
      Armytage;' Mrs. Marsh, too; and then (for Scottish manners) Miss Ferrier!"

    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (growing cross).&mdash;"Oh, if you cannot treat on bucolics but
      what you must hear some Virgil or other cry 'Stop thief,' you deserve to
      be tossed by one of your own 'short-horns.'" (Still more contemptuously)&mdash;"I
      am sure I don't know why we spend so much money on sending our sons to
      school to learn Latin, when that Anachronism of yours, Mrs. Caxton, can't
      even construe a line and a half of Phaedrus,&mdash;Phaedrus, Mrs. Caxton,
      a book which is in Latin what Goody Two-Shoes is in the vernacular!"

      can construe Phaedrus, dear!"

      My mother put her finger to her lip, and said, "Hush!" my father returned
      to the cradle of the AEsas; Captain Roland leaned his cheek on his hand,

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "There has never been occasion to use them since I've been in the parish,"
      said Parson Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that prove?" quoth the squire, sharply, and looking the parson
      full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prove!" repeated Mr. Dale, with a smile of benign, yet too conscious
      superiority, "what does experience prove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That your forefathers were great blockheads, and that their descendant is
      not a whit the wiser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Squire," replied the parson, "although that is a melancholy conclusion,
      yet if you mean it to apply universally, and not to the family of the
      Dales in particular; it is not one which my candour as a reasoner, and my
      humility as a mortal, will permit me to challenge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I defy you," said Mr. Hazeldean, triumphantly. "But to stick to the
      subject (which it is monstrous hard to do when one talks with a parson), I
      only just ask you to look yonder, and tell me on your conscience&mdash;I
      don't even say as a parson, but as a parishioner&mdash;whether you ever
      saw a more disreputable spectacle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, the squire, leaning heavily on the parson's left shoulder,
      extended his cane in a line parallel with the right eye of that
      disputatious ecclesiastic, so that he might guide the organ of sight to
      the object he had thus unflatteringly described.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess," said the parson, "that, regarded by the eye of the senses, it
      is a thing that in its best day had small pretensions to beauty, and is
      not elevated into the picturesque even by neglect and decay. But, my
      friend, regarded by the eye of the inner man,&mdash;of the rural
      philosopher and parochial legislator,&mdash;I say it is by neglect and
      decay that it is rendered a very pleasing feature in what I may call 'the
      moral topography of a parish.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire looked at the parson as if he could have beaten him; and,
      indeed, regarding the object in dispute not only with the eye of the outer
      man, but the eye of law and order, the eye of a country gentleman and a
      justice of the peace, the spectacle was scandalously disreputable. It was
      moss-grown; it was worm-eaten; it was broken right in the middle; through
      its four socketless eyes, neighboured by the nettle, peered the thistle,&mdash;the
      thistle! a forest of thistles!&mdash;and, to complete the degradation of
      the whole, those thistles had attracted the donkey of an itinerant tinker;
      and the irreverent animal was in the very act of taking his luncheon out
      of the eyes and jaws of&mdash;THE PARISH STOCKS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire looked as if he could have beaten the parson; but as he was not
      without some slight command of temper, and a substitute was luckily at
      hand, he gulped down his resentment, and made a rush&mdash;at the donkey!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the donkey was hampered by a rope to its fore-feet, to the which was
      attached a billet of wood, called technically "a clog," so that it had no
      fair chance of escape from the assault its sacrilegious luncheon had
      justly provoked. But the ass turning round with unusual nimbleness at the
      first stroke of the cane, the squire caught his foot in the rope, and went
      head over heels among the thistles. The donkey gravely bent down, and
      thrice smelt or sniffed its prostrate foe; then, having convinced itself
      that it had nothing further to apprehend for the present, and very willing
      to make the best of the reprieve, according to the poetical admonition,
      "Gather your rosebuds while you may," it cropped a thistle in full bloom,
      close to the ear of the squire,&mdash;so close, indeed, that the parson
      thought the ear was gone; and with the more probability, inasmuch as the
      squire, feeling the warm breath of the creature, bellowed out with all the
      force of lungs accustomed to give a View-hallo!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me, is it gone?" said the parson, thrusting his person between the
      ass and the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zounds and the devil!" cried the squire, rubbing himself, as he rose to
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said the parson, gently. "What a horrible oath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrible oath! If you had my nankeens on," said the squire, still rubbing
      himself, "and had fallen into a thicket of thistles, with a donkey's teeth
      within an inch of your ear&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not gone, then?" interrupted the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,&mdash;that is, I think not," said the squire, dubiously; and he
      clapped his hand to the organ in question. "No! it is not gone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven!" said the good clergyman, kindly. "Hum," growled the
      squire, who was now once more engaged in rubbing himself. "Thank Heaven
      indeed, when I am as full of thorns as a porcupine! I should just like to
      know what use thistles are in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For donkeys to eat, if you will let them, Squire," answered the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh, you beast!" cried Mr. Hazeldean, all his wrath reawakened, whether
      by the reference to the donkey species, or his inability to reply to the
      parson, or perhaps by some sudden prick too sharp for humanity&mdash;especially
      humanity in nankeens&mdash;to endure without kicking. "Ugh, you beast!" he
      exclaimed, shaking his cane at the donkey, which, at the interposition of
      the parson, had respectfully recoiled a few paces, and now stood switching
      its thin tail, and trying vainly to lift one of its fore-legs&mdash;for
      the flies teased it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor thing!" said the parson, pityingly. "See, it has a raw place on the
      shoulder, and the flies have found out the sore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am devilish glad to hear it," said the squire, vindictively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie, fie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very well to say 'Fie, fie.' It was not you who fell among the
      thistles. What 's the man about now, I wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson had walked towards a chestnut-tree that stood on the village
      green; he broke off a bough, returned to the donkey, whisked away the
      flies, and then tenderly placed the broad leaves over the sore, as a
      protection from the swarms. The donkey turned round its head, and looked
      at him with mild wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would bet a shilling," said the parson, softly, "that this is the first
      act of kindness thou hast met with this many a day. And slight enough it
      is, Heaven knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that the parson put his hand into his pocket, and drew out an apple.
      It was a fine large rose-cheeked apple, one of the last winter's store
      from the celebrated tree in the parsonage garden, and he was taking it as
      a present to a little boy in the village who had notably distinguished
      himself in the Sunday-school. "Nay, in common justice, Lenny Fairfield
      should have the preference," muttered the parson. The ass pricked up one
      of its ears, and advanced its head timidly. "But Lenny Fairfield would be
      as much pleased with twopence; and what could twopence do to thee?" The
      ass's nose now touched the apple. "Take it, in the name of Charity," quoth
      the parson; "Justice is accustomed to be served last;" and the ass took
      the apple. "How had you the heart!" said the parson, pointing to the
      squire's cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ass stopped munching, and looked askant at the squire. "Pooh! eat on;
      he'll not beat thee now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the squire, apologetically. "But after all, he is not an ass of
      the parish; he is a vagrant, and he ought to be pounded. But the pound is
      in as bad a state as the stocks, thanks to your new-fashioned doctrines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "New-fashioned!" cried the parson, almost indignantly, for he had a great
      disdain of new fashions. "They are as old as Christianity; nay, as old as
      Paradise, which you will observe is derived from a Greek, or rather a
      Persian word, and means something more than 'garden,' corresponding"
      (pursued the parson, rather pedantically) "with the Latin&mdash;vivarium,&mdash;namely,
      grove or park full of innocent dumb creatures. Depend on it, donkeys were
      allowed to eat thistles there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very possibly," said the squire, dryly. "But Hazeldeau, though a very
      pretty village, is not Paradise. The stocks shall be mended to-morrow,&mdash;ay,
      and the pound too, and the next donkey found trespassing shall go into it,
      as sure as my name's Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said the parson, gravely, "I can only hope that the next parish
      may not follow your example; or that you and I may never be caught
      straying."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Parson Dale and Squire Hazeldean parted company; the latter to inspect his
      sheep, the former to visit some of his parishioners, including Lenny
      Fairfield, whom the donkey had defrauded of his apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny Fairfield was sure to be in the way, for his mother rented a few
      acres of grass-land from the squire, and it was now hay-time. And Leonard,
      commonly called Lenny, was an only son, and his mother a widow. The
      cottage stood apart, and somewhat remote, in one of the many nooks of the
      long, green village lane. And a thoroughly English cottage it was, three
      centuries old at least; with walls of rubble let into oak frames, and duly
      whitewashed every summer, a thatched roof, small panes of glass, an old
      doorway raised from the ground by two steps. There was about this little
      dwelling all the homely rustic elegance which peasant life admits of; a
      honeysuckle was trained over the door; a few flower-pots were placed on
      the window-sills; the small plot of ground in front of the house was kept
      with great neatness, and even taste; some large rough stones on either
      side the little path having been formed into a sort of rockwork, with
      creepers that were now in flower; and the potato-ground was screened from
      the eye by sweet peas and lupine. Simple elegance, all this, it is true;
      but how well it speaks for peasant and landlord, when you see that the
      peasant is fond of his home, and has some spare time and heart to bestow
      upon mere embellishment! Such a peasant is sure to be a bad customer to
      the alehouse, and a safe neighbour to the squire's preserves. All honour
      and praise to him, except a small tax upon both, which is due to the
      landlord!
    </p>
    <p>
      Such sights were as pleasant to the parson as the most beautiful
      landscapes of Italy can be to the dilettante. He paused a moment at the
      wicket to look around him, and distended his nostrils voluptuously to
      inhale the smell of the sweet peas, mixed with that of the new-mown hay in
      the fields behind, which a slight breeze bore to him. He then moved on,
      carefully scraped his shoes, clean and well-polished as they were,&mdash;for
      Mr. Dale was rather a beau in his own clerical way,&mdash;on the scraper
      without the door, and lifted the latch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your virtuoso looks with artistical delight on the figure of some nymph
      painted on an Etruscan vase, engaged in pouring out the juice of the grape
      from her classic urn. And the parson felt as harmless, if not as elegant a
      pleasure, in contemplating Widow Fairfield brimming high a glittering can,
      which she designed for the refreshment of the thirsty haymakers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fairfield was a middle-aged, tidy woman, with that alert precision of
      movement which seems to come from an active, orderly mind; and as she now
      turned her head briskly at the sound of the parson's footstep, she showed
      a countenance prepossessing though not handsome,&mdash;a countenance from
      which a pleasant, hearty smile, breaking forth at that moment, effaced
      some lines that, in repose, spoke "of sorrows, but of sorrows past;" and
      her cheek, paler than is common to the complexions even of the fair sex,
      when born and bred amidst a rural population, might have favoured the
      guess that the earlier part of her life had been spent in the languid air
      and "within-doors" occupations of a town.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind me," said the parson, as Mrs. Fairfield dropped her quick
      courtesy, and smoothed her apron; "if you are going into the hayfield, I
      will go with you; I have something to say to Lenny,&mdash;an excellent
      boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      WIDOW.&mdash;"Well, sir, and you are kind to say it,&mdash;but so he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"He reads uncommonly well, he writes tolerably; he is the
      best lad in the whole school at his Catechism and in the Bible lessons;
      and I assure you, when I see his face at church, looking up so
      attentively, I fancy that I shall read my sermon all the better for such a
      listener!"
    </p>
    <p>
      WIDOW (wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron).&mdash;"'Deed, sir,
      when my poor Mark died, I never thought I could have lived on as I have
      done. But that boy is so kind and good, that when I look at him sitting
      there in dear Mark's chair, and remember how Mark loved him, and all he
      used to say to me about him, I feel somehow or other as if my good man
      smiled on me, and would rather I was not with him yet, till the lad had
      grown up, and did not want me any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (looking away, and after a pause).&mdash;"You never hear anything
      of the old folks at Lansmere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Deed, sir, sin' poor Mark died, they han't noticed me nor the boy; but,"
      added the widow, with all a peasant's pride, "it isn't that I wants their
      money; only it's hard to feel strange like to one's own father and
      mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"You must excuse them. Your father, Mr. Avenel, was never
      quite the same man after that sad event which&mdash;but you are weeping,
      my friend, pardon me; your mother is a little proud; but so are you,
      though in another way."
    </p>
    <p>
      WIDOW.&mdash;"I proud! Lord love ye, sir, I have not a bit o' pride in me!
      and that's the reason they always looked down on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Your parents must be well off; and I shall apply to them in
      a year or two on behalf of Lenny, for they promised me to provide for him
      when he grew up, as they ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      WIDOW (with flashing eyes).&mdash;"I am sure, sir, I hope you will do no
      such thing; for I would not have Lenny beholden to them as has never given
      him a kind word sin' he was born!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson smiled gravely, and shook his head at poor Mrs. Fairfield's
      hasty confutation of her own self-acquittal from the charge of pride; but
      he saw that it was not the time or moment for effectual peace-making in
      the most irritable of all rancours,&mdash;namely, that nourished against
      one's nearest relations. He therefore dropped the subject, and said,
      "Well, time enough to think of Lenny's future prospects; meanwhile we are
      forgetting the haymakers. Come."
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow opened the back door, which led across a little apple orchard
      into the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"You have a pleasant place here; and I see that my friend
      Lenny should be in no want of apples. I had brought him one, but I have
      given it away on the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      WIDOW.&mdash;"Oh, sir, it is not the deed,&mdash;it is the will; as I felt
      when the squire, God bless him! took two pounds off the rent the year he&mdash;that
      is, Mark&mdash;died."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"If Lenny continues to be such a help to you, it will not be
      long before the squire may put the two pounds on again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said the widow, simply; "I hope he will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly woman!" muttered the parson. "That's not exactly what the
      schoolmistress would have said. You don't read nor write, Mrs. Fairfield;
      yet you express yourself with great propriety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know Mark was a schollard, sir, like my poor, poor sister; and though
      I was a sad stupid girl afore I married, I tried to take after him when we
      came together."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They were now in the hayfield, and a boy of about sixteen, but, like most
      country lads, to appearance much younger than he was, looked up from his
      rake, with lively blue eyes beaming forth under a profusion of brown curly
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard Fairfield was indeed a very handsome boy,&mdash;not so stout nor
      so ruddy as one would choose for the ideal of rustic beauty, nor yet so
      delicate in limb and keen in expression as are those children of cities,
      in whom the mind is cultivated at the expense of the body; but still he
      had the health of the country in his cheeks, and was not without the grace
      of the city in his compact figure and easy movements. There was in his
      physiognomy something interesting from its peculiar character of innocence
      and simplicity. You could see that he had been brought up by a woman, and
      much apart from familiar contact with other children; and such
      intelligence as was yet developed in him was not ripened by the jokes and
      cuffs of his coevals, but fostered by decorous lecturings from his elders,
      and good-little-boy maxims in good-little-boy books.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Come hither, Lenny. You know the benefit of school, I see:
      it can teach you nothing better than to be a support to your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      LENNY (looking down sheepishly, and with a heightened glow over his face).&mdash;"Please,
      sir, that may come one of these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"That's right, Lenny. Let me see! why, you must be nearly a
      man. How old are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny looks up inquiringly at his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"You ought to know, Lenny: speak for yourself. Hold your
      tongue, Mrs. Fairfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      LENNY (twirling his hat, and in great perplexity).&mdash;"Well, and there
      is Flop, neighbour Dutton's old sheep-dog. He be very old now."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"I am not asking Flop's age, but your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      LENNY.&mdash;"'Deed, sir, I have heard say as how Flop and I were pups
      together. That is, I&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      For the parson is laughing, and so is Mrs. Fairfield; and the haymakers,
      who have stood still to listen, are laughing too. And poor Lenny has quite
      lost his head, and looks as if he would like to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (patting the curly locks, encouragingly).&mdash;"Never mind; it is
      not so badly answered, after all. And how old is Flop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LENNY.&mdash;"Why, he must be fifteen year and more.."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"How old, then, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LENNY (looking up, with a beam of intelligence).&mdash;"Fifteen year and
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow sighs and nods her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what we call putting two and two together," said the parson. "Or,
      in other words," and here he raised his eyes majestically towards the
      haymakers&mdash;"in other words, thanks to his love for his book, simple
      as he stands here, Lenny Fairfield has shown himself capable of INDUCTIVE
      RATIOCINATION."
    </p>
    <p>
      At those words, delivered ore rotundo, the haymakers ceased laughing; for
      even in lay matters they held the parson to be an oracle, and words so
      long must have a great deal in them. Lenny drew up his head proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very fond of Flop, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Deed he is," said the widow, "and of all poor dumb creatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. Suppose, my lad, that you had a fine apple, and that you met a
      friend who wanted it more than you, what would you do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please you, sir, I would give him half of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson's face fell. "Not the whole, Lenny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny considered. "If he was a friend, sir, he would not like me to give
      him all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, Master Leonard, you speak so well that I must e'en tell the
      truth. I brought you an apple, as a prize for good conduct in school. But
      I met by the way a poor donkey, and some one beat him for eating a
      thistle, so I thought I would make it up by giving him the apple. Ought I
      only to have given him the half?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny's innocent face became all smile; his interest was aroused. "And did
      the donkey like the apple?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much," said the parson, fumbling in his pocket; but thinking of
      Leonard Fairfield's years and understanding, and moreover observing, in
      the pride of his heart, that there were many spectators to his deed, he
      thought the meditated twopence not sufficient, and he generously produced
      a silver sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, my man, that will pay for the half apple which you would have kept
      for yourself." The parson again patted the curly locks, and after a hearty
      word or two with the other haymakers, and a friendly "Good-day" to Mrs.
      Fairfield, struck into a path that led towards his own glebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just crossed the stile, when he heard hasty but timorous feet
      behind him. He turned, and saw his friend Lenny.
    </p>
    <p>
      LENNY (half-crying, and holding out the sixpence).&mdash;"Indeed, sir, I
      would rather not. I would have given all to the Neddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Why, then, my man, you have a still greater right to the
      sixpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      LENNY.&mdash;"No, sir; 'cause you only gave it to make up for the half
      apple. And if I had given the whole, as I ought to have done, why, I
      should have had no right to the sixpence. Please, sir, don't be offended;
      do take it back, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson hesitated. And the boy thrust the sixpence into his hand, as
      the ass had poked its nose there before in quest of the apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Parson Dale, soliloquizing, "that if one don't give Justice
      the first place at the table, all the other Virtues eat up her share."
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the case was perplexing. Charity, like a forward, impudent baggage
      as she is, always thrusting herself in the way, and taking other people's
      apples to make her own little pie, had defrauded Lenny of his due; and now
      Susceptibility, who looks like a shy, blush-faced, awkward Virtue in her
      teens&mdash;but who, nevertheless, is always engaged in picking the
      pockets of her sisters&mdash;tried to filch from him his lawful
      recompense. The case was perplexing; for the parson held Susceptibility in
      great honour, despite her hypocritical tricks, and did not like to give
      her a slap in the face, which might frighten her away forever. So Mr. Dale
      stood irresolute, glancing from the sixpence to Lenny, and from Lenny to
      the sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buon giorno, Good-day to you," said a voice behind, in an accent slightly
      but unmistakably foreign, and a strange-looking figure presented itself at
      the stile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine a tall and exceedingly meagre man, dressed in a rusty suit of
      black,&mdash;the pantaloons tight at the calf and ankle, and there forming
      a loose gaiter over thick shoes, buckled high at the instep; an old cloak,
      lined with red, was thrown over one shoulder, though the day was sultry; a
      quaint, red, outlandish umbrella, with a carved brass handle, was thrust
      under one arm, though the sky was cloudless: a profusion of raven hair, in
      waving curls that seemed as fine as silk, escaped from the sides of a
      straw hat of prodigious brim; a complexion sallow and swarthy, and
      features which, though not without considerable beauty to the eye of the
      artist, were not only unlike what we fair, well-fed, neat-faced Englishmen
      are wont to consider comely, but exceedingly like what we are disposed to
      regard as awful and Satanic,&mdash;to wit, a long hooked nose, sunken
      cheeks, black eyes, whose piercing brilliancy took something wizard-like
      and mystical from the large spectacles through which they shone; a mouth
      round which played an ironical smile, and in which a physiognomist would
      have remarked singular shrewdness, and some closeness, complete the
      picture. Imagine this figure, grotesque, peregrinate, and to the eye of a
      peasant certainly diabolical; then perch it on the stile in the midst of
      those green English fields, and in sight of that primitive English
      village; there let it sit straddling, its long legs dangling down, a short
      German pipe emitting clouds from one corner of those sardonic lips, its
      dark eyes glaring through the spectacles full upon the parson, yet askant
      upon Lenny Fairfield. Lenny Fairfield looked exceedingly frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, Dr. Riccabocca," said Mr. Dale, smiling, "you come in good
      time to solve a very nice question in casuistry;" and herewith the parson
      explained the case, and put the question, "Ought Lenny Fairfield to have
      the sixpence, or ought he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cospetto!" said the doctor, "if the hen would but hold her tongue, nobody
      would know that she had laid an egg."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Granted," said the parson; "but what follows? The saying is good, but I
      don't see the application."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand pardons!" replied Dr. Riccabocca, with all the urbanity of an
      Italian; "but it seems to me that if you had given the sixpence to the
      fanciullo, that is, to this good little boy, without telling him the story
      about the donkey, you would never have put him and yourself into this
      awkward dilemma."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear sir," whispered the parson, mildly, as he inclined his lips
      to the doctor's ear, "I should then have lost the opportunity of
      inculcating a moral lesson&mdash;you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca shrugged his shoulders, restored his pipe to his mouth, and
      took a long whiff. It was a whiff eloquent, though cynical,&mdash;a whiff
      peculiar to your philosophical smoker, a whiff that implied the most
      absolute but the most placid incredulity as to the effect of the parson's
      moral lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still you have not given us your decision," said the parson, after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor withdrew the pipe. "Cospetto!" said he,&mdash;"he who scrubs
      the head of an ass wastes his soap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you scrubbed mine fifty times over with those enigmatical proverbs of
      yours," said the parson, testily, "you would not make it any the wiser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good sir," said the doctor, bowing low from his perch on the stile, "I
      never presumed to say that there were more asses than one in the story;
      but I thought that I could not better explain my meaning, which is simply
      this,&mdash;you scrubbed the ass's head, and therefore you must lose the
      soap. Let the fanciullo have the sixpence; and a great sum it is, too, for
      a little boy, who may spend it all as pocketmoney!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, Lenny, you hear?" said the parson, stretching out the sixpence.
      But Lenny retreated, and cast on the umpire a look of great aversion and
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, Master Dale," said he, obstinately, "I'd rather not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a matter of feeling, you see," said the parson, turning to the
      umpire; "and I believe the boy is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be a matter of feeling," replied Dr. Riccabocca, "there is no more
      to be said on it. When Feeling comes in at the door, Reason has nothing to
      do but to jump out of the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, my good boy," said the parson, pocketing the coin; "but, stop! give
      me your hand first. There&mdash;I understand you;&mdash;good-by!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny's eyes glistened as the parson shook him by the hand, and, not
      trusting himself to speak, he walked off sturdily. The parson wiped his
      forehead, and sat himself down on the stile beside the Italian. The view
      before them was lovely, and both enjoyed it (though not equally) enough to
      be silent for some moments. On the other side the lane, seen between gaps
      in the old oaks and chestnuts that hung over the mossgrown pales of
      Hazeldean Park, rose gentle, verdant slopes, dotted with sheep and herds
      of deer. A stately avenue stretched far away to the left, and ended at the
      right hand within a few yards of a ha-ha that divided the park from a
      level sward of tableland, gay with shrubs and flower-pots, relieved by the
      shade of two mighty cedars. And on this platform, only seen in part, stood
      the squire's old-fashioned house, red-brick, with stone mullions,
      gable-ends, and quaint chimney-pots. On this side the road, immediately
      facing the two gentlemen, cottage after cottage whitely emerged from the
      curves in the lane, while, beyond, the ground declining gave an extensive
      prospect of woods and cornfields, spires and farms. Behind, from a belt of
      lilacs and evergreens, you caught a peep of the parsonage-house, backed by
      woodlands, and a little noisy rill running in front. The birds were still
      in the hedgerows,&mdash;only (as if from the very heart of the most
      distant woods), there came now and then the mellow note of the cuckoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Verily," said Mr. Dale, softly, "my lot has fallen on a goodly heritage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian twitched his cloak over him, and sighed almost inaudibly.
      Perhaps he thought of his own Summer Land, and felt that, amidst all that
      fresh verdure of the North, there was no heritage for the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, before the parson could notice the sigh or conjecture the cause,
      Dr. Riccabocca's thin lips took an expression almost malignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Per Bacco!" said he; "in every country I observe that the rooks settle
      where the trees are the finest. I am sure that, when Noah first landed on
      Ararat, he must have found some gentleman in black already settled in the
      pleasantest part of the mountain, and waiting for his tenth of the cattle
      as they came out of the Ark."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson fixed his meek eyes on the philosopher, and there was in them
      something so deprecating rather than reproachful that Dr. Riccabocca
      turned away his face, and refilled his pipe. Dr. Riccabocca abhorred
      priests; but though Parson Dale was emphatically a parson, he seemed at
      that moment so little of what Dr. Riccabocca understood by a priest that
      the Italian's heart smote him for his irreverent jest on the cloth.
      Luckily at this moment there was a diversion to that untoward commencement
      of conversation in the appearance of no less a personage than the donkey
      himself&mdash;I mean the donkey who ate the apple.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tinker was a stout, swarthy fellow, jovial and musical withal, for he
      was singing a stave as he flourished his staff, and at the end of each
      refrain down came the staff on the quarters of the donkey. The tinker went
      behind and sang, the donkey went before and was thwacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours is a droll country," quoth Dr. Riccabocca; "in mine, it is not the
      ass that walks first in the procession that gets the blows."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson jumped from the stile, and looking over the hedge that divided
      the field from the road&mdash;"Gently, gently," said he; "the sound of the
      stick spoils the singing! Oh, Mr. Sprott, Mr. Sprott! a good man is
      merciful to his beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey seemed to recognize the voice of its friend, for it stopped
      short, pricked one ear wistfully, and looked up. The tinker touched his
      hat, and looked up too. "Lord bless your reverence! he does not mind it,&mdash;he
      likes it. I vould not hurt thee; would I, Neddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey shook his head and shivered; perhaps a fly had settled on the
      sore, which the chestnut leaves no longer protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you did not mean to hurt him, Sprott," said the parson, more
      politely I fear than honestly,&mdash;for he had seen enough of that
      cross-grained thing called the human heart, even in the little world of a
      country parish, to know that it requires management and coaxing and
      flattering, to interfere successfully between a man and his own donkey,&mdash;"I
      am sure you did not mean to hurt him; but he has already got a sore on his
      shoulder as big as my hand, poor thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord love 'un! yes; that was done a playing with the manger the day I
      gave 'un oats!" said the tinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca adjusted his spectacles, and surveyed the ass. The ass
      pricked up his other ear, and surveyed Dr. Riccabocca. In that mutual
      survey of physical qualifications, each being regarded according to the
      average symmetry of its species, it may be doubted whether the advantage
      was on the side of the philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson had a great notion of the wisdom of his friend in all matters
      not purely ecclesiastical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say a good word for the donkey!" whispered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said the doctor, addressing Mr. Sprott, with a respectful
      salutation, "there's a great kettle at my house&mdash;the Casino&mdash;which
      wants soldering: can you recommend me a tinker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that's all in my line," said Sprott; "and there ben't a tinker in
      the county that I vould recommend like myself, tho'f I say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You jest, good sir," said the doctor, smiling pleasantly. "A man who
      can't mend a hole in his own donkey can never demean himself by patching
      up my great kettle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord, sir!" said the tinker, archly, "if I had known that poor Neddy had
      had two sitch friends in court, I'd have seen he vas a gintleman, and
      treated him as sitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corpo di Bacco!" quoth the doctor, "though that jest's not new, I think
      the tinker comes very well out of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; but the donkey!" said the parson; "I've a great mind to buy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me to tell you an anecdote in point," said Dr. Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said the parson, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once on a time," pursued Riccabocca, "the Emperor Adrian, going to the
      public baths, saw an old soldier, who had served under him, rubbing his
      back against the marble wall. The emperor, who was a wise, and therefore a
      curious, inquisitive man, sent for the soldier, and asked him why he
      resorted to that sort of friction. 'Because,' answered the veteran, 'I am
      too poor to have slaves to rub me down.' The emperor was touched, and gave
      him slaves and money. The next day, when Adrian went to the baths, all the
      old men in the city were to be seen rubbing themselves against the marble
      as hard as they could. The emperor sent for them, and asked them the same
      question which he had put to the soldier; the cunning old rogues, of
      course, made the same answer. 'Friends,' said Adrian, 'since there are so
      many of you, you will just rub one another!' Mr. Dale, if you don't want
      to have all the donkeys in the county with holes in their shoulders, you
      had better not buy the tinker's!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the hardest thing in the world to do the least bit of good,"
      groaned the parson, as he broke a twig off the hedge nervously, snapped it
      in two, and flung away the fragments: one of them hit the donkey on the
      nose. If the ass could have spoken Latin he would have said, "Et tu,
      Brute!" As it was, he hung down his ears, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee hup," said the tinker, and he followed the ass. Then stopping, he
      looked over his shoulder, and seeing that the parson's eyes were gazing
      mournfully on his protege, "Never fear, your reverence," cried the tinker,
      kindly, "I'll not spite 'un."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Four, o'clock," cried the parson, looking at his watch; "half an hour
      after dinner-time, and Mrs. Dale particularly begged me to be punctual,
      because of the fine trout the squire sent us. Will you venture on what our
      homely language calls 'pot-luck,' Doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Riccabocca was a professed philosopher, and valued himself on his
      penetration into the motives of human conduct. And when the parson thus
      invited him to pot-luck, he smiled with a kind of lofty complacency; for
      Mrs. Dale enjoyed the reputation of having what her friends styled "her
      little tempers." And, as well-bred ladies rarely indulge "little tempers"
      in the presence of a third person not of the family, so Dr. Riccabocca
      instantly concluded that he was invited to stand between the pot and the
      luck! Nevertheless&mdash;as he was fond of trout, and a much more
      good-natured man than he ought to have been according to his principles&mdash;he
      accepted the hospitality; but he did so with a sly look from over his
      spectacles, which brought a blush into the guilty cheeks of the parson.
      Certainly Riccabocca had for once guessed right in his estimate of human
      motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two walked on, crossed a little bridge that spanned the rill, and
      entered the parsonage lawn. Two dogs, that seemed to have sat on watch for
      their master, sprang towards him, barking; and the sound drew the notice
      of Mrs. Dale, who, with parasol in hand, sallied out from the sash window
      which opened on the lawn. Now, O reader! I know that, in thy secret heart,
      thou art chuckling over the want of knowledge in the sacred arcana of the
      domestic hearth betrayed by the author; thou art saying to thyself, "A
      pretty way to conciliate 'little tempers' indeed, to add to the offence of
      spoiling the fish the crime of bringing an unexpected friend to eat it.
      Pot-luck, quotha, when the pot 's boiled over this half hour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to thy utter shame and confusion, O reader! learn that both the
      author and Parson Dale knew very well what they were about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca was the special favourite of Mrs. Dale, and the only person
      in the whole county who never put her out, by dropping in. In fact,
      strange though it may seem at first glance, Dr. Riccabocca had that
      mysterious something about him, which we of his own sex can so little
      comprehend, but which always propitiates the other. He owed this, in part,
      to his own profound but hypocritical policy; for he looked upon woman as
      the natural enemy to man, against whom it was necessary to be always on
      the guard; whom it was prudent to disarm by every species of fawning
      servility and abject complaisance. He owed it also, in part, to the
      compassionate and heavenly nature of the angels whom his thoughts thus
      villanously traduced&mdash;for women like one whom they can pity without
      despising; and there was something in Signor Riccabocca's poverty, in his
      loneliness, in his exile, whether voluntary or compelled, that excited
      pity; while, despite his threadbare coat, the red umbrella, and the wild
      hair, he had, especially when addressing ladies, that air of gentleman and
      cavalier, which is or was more innate in an educated Italian, of whatever
      rank, than perhaps in the highest aristocracy of any other country in
      Europe. For, though I grant that nothing is more exquisite than the
      politeness of your French marquis of the old regime, nothing more frankly
      gracious than the cordial address of a high-bred English gentleman,
      nothing more kindly prepossessing than the genial good-nature of some
      patriarchal German, who will condescend to forget his sixteen quarterings
      in the pleasure of doing you a favour,&mdash;yet these specimens of the
      suavity of their several nations are rare; whereas blandness and polish
      are common attributes with your Italian. They seem to have been
      immemorially handed down to him, from ancestors emulating the urbanity of
      Caesar, and refined by the grace of Horace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Riccabocca consents to dine with us," cried the parson, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Madame permit?" said the Italian, bowing over the hand extended to
      him, which, however, he forbore to take, seeing it was already full of the
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only sorry that the trout must be quite spoiled," began Mrs. Dale,
      plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not the trout one thinks of when one dines with Mrs. Dale," said
      the infamous dissimulator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I see James coming to say that dinner is ready," observed the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said that three-quarters of an hour ago, Charles dear," retorted Mrs.
      Dale, taking the arm of Dr. Riccabocca.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the parson and his wife are entertaining their guest, I propose to
      regale the reader with a small treatise a propos of that "Charles dear,"
      murmured by Mrs. Dale,&mdash;a treatise expressly written for the benefit
      of The Domestic Circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an old jest that there is not a word in the language that conveys so
      little endearment as the word "dear." But though the saying itself, like
      most truths, be trite and hackneyed, no little novelty remains to the
      search of the inquirer into the varieties of inimical import comprehended
      in that malign monosyllable. For instance, I submit to the experienced
      that the degree of hostility it betrays is in much proportioned to its
      collocation in the sentence. When, gliding indirectly through the rest of
      the period, it takes its stand at the close, as in that "Charles dear" of
      Mrs. Dale, it has spilled so much of its natural bitterness by the way
      that it assumes even a smile, "amara lento temperet risu." Sometimes the
      smile is plaintive, sometimes arch. For example:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Plaintive.) "I know very well that whatever I do is wrong, Charles dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I am very glad you amused yourself so much without me, Charles
      dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so loud! If you had but my poor head, Charles dear," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Arch.) "If you could spill the ink anywhere but on the best tablecloth,
      Charles dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But though you must always have your own way, you are not quite
      faultless, own, Charles dear," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the enemy stops in the middle of the sentence, its venom is naturally
      less exhausted. For example:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, I must say, Charles dear, that you are the most fidgety person,"
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if the house bills were so high last week, Charles dear, I should
      just like to know whose fault it was&mdash;that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know, Charles dear, that you care no more for me and the children
      than&mdash;" etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the fatal word spring up, in its primitive freshness, at the head
      of the sentence, bow your head to the storm. It then assumes the majesty
      of "my" before it; it is generally more than simple objurgation,&mdash;it
      prefaces a sermon. My candour obliges me to confess that this is the mode
      in which the hateful monosyllable is more usually employed by the marital
      part of the one flesh; and has something about it of the odious assumption
      of the Petruchian paterfamilias&mdash;the head of the family&mdash;boding,
      not perhaps "peace and love, and quiet life," but certainly "awful rule
      and right supremacy." For example:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Jane, I wish you would just put by that everlasting crochet, and
      listen to me for a few moments," etc. "My dear Jane, I wish you would
      understand me for once; don't think I am angry,&mdash;no, but I am hurt!
      You must consider," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Jane, I don't know if it is your intention to ruin me; but I only
      wish you would do as all other women do who care three straws for their
      husband's property," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Jane, I wish you to understand that I am the last person in the
      world to be jealous; but I'll be d&mdash;-d if that puppy, Captain
      Prettyman," etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, few so carefully cultivate the connubial garden, as to feel much
      surprise at the occasional sting of a homely nettle or two; but who ever
      expected, before entering that garden, to find himself pricked and
      lacerated by an insidious exotical "dear," which he had been taught to
      believe only lived in a hothouse, along with myrtles and other tender and
      sensitive shrubs which poets appropriate to Venus? Nevertheless Parson
      Dale, being a patient man, and a pattern to all husbands, would have found
      no fault with his garden, though there had not been a single specimen of
      "dear,"&mdash;whether the dear humilis or the dear superba; the dear
      pallida, rubra, or nigra; the dear suavis or the dear horrida,&mdash;no,
      not a single "dear" in the whole horticulture of matrimony, which Mrs.
      Dale had not brought to perfection. But this was far from being the case;
      Mrs. Dale, living much in retirement, was unaware of the modern
      improvements, in variety of colour and sharpness of prickle, which have
      rewarded the persevering skill of our female florists.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the cool of the evening Dr. Riccabocca walked home across the fields.
      Mr. and Mrs. Dale had accompanied him half-way, and as they now turned
      back to the parsonage, they looked behind to catch a glimpse of the tall,
      outlandish figure, winding slowly through the path amidst the waves of the
      green corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor man!" said Mrs. Dale, feelingly; "and the button was off his
      wristband! What a pity he has nobody to take care of him! He seems very
      domestic. Don't you think, Charles, it would be a great blessing if we
      could get him a good wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um," said the parson; "I doubt if he values the married state as he
      ought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, Charles? I never saw a man more polite to ladies in my
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what? You are always so mysterious, Charles dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mysterious! No, Carry; but if you could hear what the doctor says of the
      ladies sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, when you men get together, my dear. I know what that means&mdash;pretty
      things you say of us! But you are all alike; you know you are, love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure," said the parson, simply, "that I have good cause to speak
      well of the sex&mdash;when I think of you and my poor mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dale, who, with all her "tempers," was an excellent woman, and loved
      her husband with the whole of her quick little heart, was touched. She
      pressed his hand, and did not call him dear all the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Italian passed the fields, and came upon the high road about
      two miles from Hazeldean. On one side stood an old-fashioned solitary inn,
      such as English inns used to be before they became railway hotels,&mdash;square,
      solid, old-fashioned, looking so hospitable and comfortable, with their
      great signs swinging from some elm-tree in front, and the long row of
      stables standing a little back, with a chaise or two in the yard, and the
      jolly landlord talking of the crops to some stout farmer, whose rough pony
      halts of itself at the well-known door. Opposite this inn, on the other
      side of the road, stood the habitation of Dr. Riecabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years before the date of these annals, the stage-coach on its way to
      London from a seaport town stopped at the inn, as was its wont, for a good
      hour, that its passengers might dine like Christian Englishmen&mdash;not
      gulp down a basin of scalding soup, like everlasting heathen Yankees, with
      that cursed railway-whistle shrieking like a fiend in their ears! It was
      the best dining-place on the whole road, for the trout in the neighbouring
      rill were famous, and so was the mutton which came from Hazeldean Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the outside of the coach had descended two passengers, who, alone
      insensible to the attractions of mutton and trout, refused to dine,&mdash;two
      melancholy-looking foreigners, of whom one was Signor Riccabocca, much the
      same as we see him now, only that the black suit was less threadbare, the
      tall form less meagre, and he did not then wear spectacles; and the other
      was his servant. "They would walk about while the coach stopped." Now the
      Italian's eye had been caught by a mouldering, dismantled house on the
      other side the road, which nevertheless was well situated; half-way up a
      green hill, with its aspect due south, a little cascade falling down
      artificial rockwork, a terrace with a balustrade, and a few broken urns
      and statues before its Ionic portico, while on the roadside stood a board,
      with characters already half effaced, implying that the house was "To be
      let unfurnished, with or without land."
    </p>
    <p>
      The abode that looked so cheerless, and which had so evidently hung long
      on hand, was the property of Squire Hazeldean. It had been built by his
      grandfather on the female side,&mdash;a country gentleman who had actually
      been in Italy (a journey rare enough to boast of in those days), and who,
      on his return home, had attempted a miniature imitation of an Italian
      villa. He left an only daughter and sole heiress, who married Squire
      Hazeldean's father; and since that time, the house, abandoned by its
      proprietors for the larger residence of the Hazeldeans, had been
      uninhabited and neglected. Several tenants, indeed, had offered
      themselves; but your true country squire is slow in admitting upon his own
      property a rival neighbour. Some wanted shooting. "That," said the
      Hazeldeans, who were great sportsmen and strict preservers, "was quite out
      of the question." Others were fine folks from London. "London servants,"
      said the Hazeldeans, who were moral and prudent people, "would corrupt
      their own, and bring London prices." Others, again, were retired
      manufacturers, at whom the Hazeldeans turned up their agricultural noses.
      In short, some were too grand, and others too vulgar. Some were refused
      because they were known so well: "Friends were best at a distance," said
      the Hazeldeans; others because they were not known at all: "No good comes
      of strangers," said the Hazeldeans. And finally, as the house fell more
      and more into decay, no one would take it unless it was put into thorough
      repair: "As if one was made of money!" said the Hazeldeans. In short,
      there stood the house unoccupied and ruinous; and there, on its terrace,
      stood the two forlorn Italians, surveying it with a smile at each other,
      as for the first time since they set foot in England, they recognized, in
      dilapidated pilasters and broken statues, in a weed-grown terrace and the
      remains of an orangery, something that reminded them of the land they had
      left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to the inn, Dr. Riccabocca took the occasion to learn from
      the innkeeper (who was indeed a tenant of the squire) such particulars as
      he could collect; and a few days afterwards Mr. Hazeldean received a
      letter from a solicitor of repute in London, stating that a very
      respectable foreign gentleman had commissioned him to treat for Clump
      Lodge, otherwise called the "Casino;" that the said gentleman did not
      shoot, lived in great seclusion, and, having no family, did not care about
      the repairs of the place, provided only it were made weather-proof,&mdash;if
      the omission of more expensive reparations could render the rent suitable
      to his finances, which were very limited. The offer came at a fortunate
      moment, when the steward had just been representing to the squire the
      necessity of doing something to keep the Casino from falling into positive
      ruin, and the squire was cursing the fates which had put the Casino into
      an entail&mdash;so that he could not pull it down for the building
      materials. Mr. Hazeldean therefore caught at the proposal even as a fair
      lady, who has refused the best offers in the kingdom, catches, at last, at
      some battered old captain on half-pay, and replied that, as for rent, if
      the solicitor's client was a quiet, respectable man, he did not care for
      that, but that the gentleman might have it for the first year rent-free,
      on condition of paying the taxes, and putting the place a little in order.
      If they suited each other, they could then come to terms. Ten days
      subsequently to this gracious reply, Signor Riccabocca and his servant
      arrived; and, before the year's end, the squire was so contented with his
      tenant that he gave him a running lease of seven, fourteen, or twenty-one
      years, at a rent merely nominal, on condition that Signor Riccabocca would
      put and maintain the place in repair, barring the roof and fences, which
      the squire generously renewed at his own expense. It was astonishing, by
      little and little, what a pretty place the Italian had made of it, and,
      what is more astonishing, how little it had cost him. He had, indeed,
      painted the walls of the hall, staircase, and the rooms appropriated to
      himself, with his own hands. His servant had done the greater part of the
      upholstery. The two between them had got the garden into order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italians seemed to have taken a joint love to the place, and to deck
      it as they would have done some favourite chapel to their Madonna.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before the natives reconciled themselves to the odd ways of
      the foreign settlers. The first thing that offended them was the exceeding
      smallness of the household bills. Three days out of the seven, indeed,
      both man and master dined on nothing else but the vegetables in the
      garden, and the fishes in the neighbouring rill; when no trout could be
      caught they fried the minnows (and certainly, even in the best streams,
      minnows are more frequently caught than trout). The next thing which
      angered the natives quite as much, especially the female part of the
      neighbourhood, was the very sparing employment the two he creatures gave
      to the sex usually deemed so indispensable in household matters. At first,
      indeed, they had no woman-servant at all. But this created such horror
      that Parson Dale ventured a hint upon the matter, which Riccabocca took in
      very good part; and an old woman was forthwith engaged after some
      bargaining&mdash;at three shillings a week&mdash;to wash and scrub as much
      as she liked during the daytime. She always returned to her own cottage to
      sleep. The man-servant, who was styled in the neighbourhood "Jackeymo,"
      did all else for his master,&mdash;smoothed his room, dusted his papers,
      prepared his coffee, cooked his dinner, brushed his clothes, and cleaned
      his pipes, of which Riccabocca had a large collection. But however close a
      man's character, it generally creeps out in driblets; and on many little
      occasions the Italian had shown acts of kindness, and, on some more rare
      occasions, even of generosity, which had served to silence his
      calumniators, and by degrees he had established a very fair reputation,&mdash;suspected,
      it is true, of being a little inclined to the Black Art, and of a strange
      inclination to starve Jackeymo and himself, in other respects harmless
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Riccabocca had become very intimate, as we have seen, at the
      Parsonage. But not so at the Hall. For though the squire was inclined to
      be very friendly to all his neighbours, he was, like most country
      gentlemen, rather easily huffed. Riccabocca had, with great politeness,
      still with great obstinacy, refused Mr. Hazeldean's earlier invitations to
      dinner; and when the squire found that the Italian rarely declined to dine
      at the Parsonage, he was offended in one of his weak points,&mdash;namely,
      his pride in the hospitality of Hazeldean Hall,&mdash;and he ceased
      altogether invitations so churlishly rejected. Nevertheless, as it was
      impossible for the squire, however huffed, to bear malice, he now and then
      reminded Riccabocca of his existence by presents of game, and would have
      called on him more often than he did, but that Riccabocca received him
      with such excessive politeness that the blunt country gentleman felt shy
      and put out, and used to say that "to call on Rickeybockey was as bad as
      going to Court."
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have left Dr. Riccabocca on the high road. By this time he has
      ascended a narrow path that winds by the side of the cascade, he has
      passed a trellis-work covered with vines, from which Jackeymo has
      positively succeeded in making what he calls wine,&mdash;a liquid, indeed,
      that if the cholera had been popularly known in those days, would have
      soured the mildest member of the Board of Health; for Squire Hazeldean,
      though a robust man who daily carried off his bottle of port with
      impunity, having once rashly tasted it, did not recover the effect till he
      had had a bill from the apothecary as long as his own arm. Passing this
      trellis, Dr. Riccabocca entered upon the terrace, with its stone pavement
      as smoothed and trimmed as hands could make it. Here, on neat stands, all
      his favourite flowers were arranged; here four orange trees were in full
      blossom; here a kind of summer-house, or belvidere, built by Jackeymo and
      himself, made his chosen morning room from May till October; and from this
      belvidere there was as beautiful an expanse of prospect as if our English
      Nature had hospitably spread on her green board all that she had to offer
      as a banquet to the exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man without his coat, which was thrown over the balustrade, was employed
      in watering the flowers,&mdash;a man with movements so mechanical, with a
      face so rigidly grave in its tawny hues, that he seemed like an automaton
      made out of mahogany.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giacomo," said Dr. Riccabocca, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The automaton stopped its hand, and turned its head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put by the watering-pot, and come hither," continued Riccabocca, in
      Italian; and, moving towards the balustrade, he leaned over it. Mr.
      Mitford, the historian, calls Jean Jacques "John James." Following that
      illustrious example, Giacomo shall be Anglified into Jackeymo. Jackeymo
      came to the balustrade also, and stood a little behind his master.
      "Friend," said Riccabocca, "enterprises have not always succeeded with us.
      Don't you think, after all, it is tempting our evil star to rent those
      fields from the landlord?" Jackeymo crossed himself, and made some strange
      movement with a little coral charm which he wore set in a ring on his
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the Madonna send us luck, and we could hire a lad cheap?" said
      Jackeymo, doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Piu vale un presente che dui futuri,"&mdash;["A bird in the hand is worth
      two in the bush."]&mdash;said Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chi non fa quando pub, non pub, fare quando vuole,"&mdash;["He who will
      not when he may, when he wills it shall have nay."]&mdash;answered
      Jackeymo, as sententiously as his master. "And the Padrone should think in
      time that he must lay by for the dower of the poor signorina."
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca sighed, and made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must be that high now!" said Jackeymo, putting his hand on some
      imaginary line a little above the balustrade. Riccabocca's eyes, raised
      over the spectacles, followed the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the Padrone could but see her here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I did," muttered the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He would never let her go from his side till she went to a husband's,"
      continued Jackeymo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this climate,&mdash;she could never stand it," said Riccabocca,
      drawing his cloak round him, as a north wind took him in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The orange trees blossom even here with care," said Jackeymo, turning
      back to draw down an awning where the orange trees faced the north. "See!"
      he added, as he returned with a sprig in full bud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca bent over the blossom, and then placed it in his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other one should be there too," said Jackeymo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To die&mdash;as this does already!" answered Riccabocca. "Say no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo shrugged his shoulders; and then, glancing at his master, drew
      his hand over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Jackeymo was the first to break it. "But, whether here
      or there, beauty without money is the orange tree without shelter. If a
      lad could be got cheap, I would hire the land, and trust for the crop to
      the Madonna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I know of such a lad," said Riccabocca, recovering himself, and
      with his sardonic smile once more lurking about the corners of his mouth,&mdash;"a
      lad made for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diavolo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not the Diavolo! Friend, I have this day seen a boy who&mdash;refused
      sixpence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cosa stupenda!" exclaimed Jackeymo, opening his eyes, and letting fall
      the watering-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him, Padrone, in Heaven's name, and the fields will grow gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will think of it, for it must require management to catch such a boy,"
      said Riccabocca. "Meanwhile, light a candle in the parlour, and bring from
      my bedroom that great folio of Machiavelli."

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In my next chapter I shall present Squire Hazeldean in patriarchal state,&mdash;not
      exactly under the fig-tree he has planted, but before the stocks he has
      reconstructed,&mdash;Squire Hazeldean and his family on the village green!
      The canvas is all ready for the colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this chapter I must so far afford a glimpse into antecedents as to
      let the reader know that there is one member of the family whom he is not
      likely to meet at present, if ever, on the village green at Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our squire lost his father two years after his birth; his mother was very
      handsome&mdash;and so was her jointure; she married again at the
      expiration of her year of mourning; the object of her second choice was
      Colonel Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every generation of Englishmen (at least since the lively reign of
      Charles II.) there are a few whom some elegant Genius skims off from the
      milk of human nature, and reserves for the cream of society. Colonel
      Egerton was one of these terque quaterque beati, and dwelt apart on a top
      shelf in that delicate porcelain dish&mdash;not bestowed upon vulgar
      buttermilk&mdash;which persons of fashion call The Great World. Mighty was
      the marvel of Pall Mall, and profound was the pity of Park Lane, when this
      supereminent personage condescended to lower himself into a husband. But
      Colonel Egerton was not a mere gaudy butterfly; he had the provident
      instincts ascribed to the bee. Youth had passed from him, and carried off
      much solid property in its flight; he saw that a time was fast coming when
      a home, with a partner who could help to maintain it, would be conducive
      to his comforts, and an occasional hum-drum evening by the fireside
      beneficial to his health. In the midst of one season at Brighton, to which
      gay place he had accompanied the Prince of Wales, he saw a widow, who,
      though in the weeds of mourning, did not appear inconsolable. Her person
      pleased his taste; the accounts of her jointure satisfied his
      understanding; he contrived an introduction, and brought a brief wooing to
      a happy close. The late Mr. Hazeldean had so far anticipated the chance of
      the young widow's second espousals, that, in case of that event, he
      transferred, by his testamentary dispositions, the guardianship of his
      infant heir from the mother to two squires whom he had named his
      executors. This circumstance combined with her new ties somewhat to
      alienate Mrs. Hazeldean from the pledge of her former loves; and when she
      had borne a son to Colonel Egerton, it was upon that child that her
      maternal affections gradually concentrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Hazeldean was sent by his guardians to a large provincial academy,
      at which his forefathers had received their education time out of mind. At
      first he spent his holidays with Mrs. Egerton; but as she now resided
      either in London, or followed her lord to Brighton, to partake of the
      gayeties at the Pavilion, so as he grew older, William, who had a hearty
      affection for country life, and of whose bluff manners and rural breeding
      Mrs. Egerton (having grown exceedingly refined) was openly ashamed, asked
      and obtained permission to spend his vacations either with his guardians
      or at the old Hall. He went late to a small college at Cambridge, endowed
      in the fifteenth century by some ancestral Hazeldean; and left it, on
      coming of age, without taking a degree. A few years afterwards he married
      a young lady, country born and bred like himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile his half-brother, Audley Egerton, may be said to have begun his
      initiation into the beau monde before he had well cast aside his coral and
      bells; he had been fondled in the lap of duchesses, and had galloped
      across the room astride on the canes of ambassadors and princes. For
      Colonel Egerton was not only very highly connected, not only one of the
      Dii majores of fashion, but he had the still rarer good fortune to be an
      exceedingly popular man with all who knew him,&mdash;so popular, that even
      the fine ladies whom he had adored and abandoned forgave him for marrying
      out of "the set," and continued to be as friendly as if he had not married
      at all. People who were commonly called heartless were never weary of
      doing kind things to the Egertons. When the time came for Audley to leave
      the preparatory school at which his infancy budded forth amongst the
      stateliest of the little lilies of the field, and go to Eton, half the
      fifth and sixth forms had been canvassed to be exceedingly civil to young
      Egerton. The boy soon showed that he inherited his father's talent for
      acquiring popularity, and that to this talent he added those which put
      popularity to use. Without achieving any scholastic distinction, he yet
      contrived to establish at Eton the most desirable reputation which a boy
      can obtain,&mdash;namely, that among his own contemporaries, the
      reputation of a boy who was sure to do something when he grew to be a man.
      As a gentleman-commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, he continued to sustain
      this high expectation, though he won no prizes, and took but an ordinary
      degree; and at Oxford the future "something" became more defined,&mdash;it
      was "something in public life" that this young man was to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was yet at the University, both his parents died, within a few
      months of each other. And when Audley Egerton came of age, he succeeded to
      a paternal property which was supposed to be large, and indeed had once
      been so; but Colonel Egerton had been too lavish a man to enrich his heir,
      and about L1500 a year was all that sales and mortgages left of an estate
      that had formerly approached a rental of L10,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Audley was considered to be opulent; and he did not dispel that
      favourable notion by any imprudent exhibition of parsimony. On entering
      the world of London, the Clubs flew open to receive him, and he woke one
      morning to find himself, not indeed famous&mdash;but the fashion. To this
      fashion he at once gave a certain gravity and value, he associated as much
      as possible with public men and political ladies, he succeeded in
      confirming the notion that he was "born to ruin or to rule the State."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dearest and most intimate friend of Audley Egerton was Lord
      L'Estrange, from whom he had been inseparable at Eton, and who now, if
      Audley Egerton was the fashion, was absolutely the rage in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley, Lord L'Estrange, was the only son of the Earl of Lansmere, a
      nobleman of considerable wealth, and allied, by intermarriages, to the
      loftiest and most powerful families in England. Lord Lansmere,
      nevertheless, was but little known in the circles of London. He lived
      chiefly on his estates, occupying himself with the various duties of a
      great proprietor, and when he came to the metropolis, it was rather to
      save than to spend; so that he could afford to give his son a very ample
      allowance, when Harley, at the age of sixteen (having already attained to
      the sixth form at Eton), left school for one of the regiments of the
      Guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few knew what to make of Harley L'Estrange,&mdash;and that was, perhaps,
      the reason why he was so much thought of. He had been by far the most
      brilliant boy of his time at Eton,&mdash;not only the boast of the
      cricket-ground, but the marvel of the schoolroom; yet so full of whims and
      oddities, and seeming to achieve his triumphs with so little aid from
      steadfast application, that he had not left behind him the same
      expectations of solid eminence which his friend and senior, Audley
      Egerton, had excited. His eccentricities, his quaint sayings, and
      out-of-the-way actions, became as notable in the great world as they had
      been in the small one of a public school. That he was very clever there
      was no doubt, and that the cleverness was of a high order might be
      surmised, not only from the originality but the independence of his
      character. He dazzled the world, without seeming to care for its praise or
      its censure,&mdash;dazzled it, as it were, because he could not help
      shining. He had some strange notions, whether political or social, which
      rather frightened his father. According to Southey, "A man should be no
      more ashamed of having been a republican than of having been young." Youth
      and extravagant opinions naturally go together. I don't know whether
      Harley L'Estrange was a republican at the age of eighteen; but there was
      no young man in London who seemed to care less for being heir to an
      illustrious name and some forty or fifty thousand pounds a year. It was a
      vulgar fashion in that day to play the exclusive, and cut persons who wore
      bad neckcloths, and called themselves Smith or Johnson. Lord L'Estrange
      never cut any one, and it was quite enough to slight some worthy man
      because of his neckcloth or his birth to insure to the offender the
      pointed civilities of this eccentric successor to the Belforts and the
      Wildairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the wish of his father that Harley, as soon as he came of age,
      should represent the borough of Lansmere (which said borough was the
      single plague of the earl's life). But this wish was never realized.
      Suddenly, when the young idol of London still wanted some two or three
      years of his majority, a new whim appeared to seize him. He withdrew
      entirely from society; he left unanswered the most pressing three-cornered
      notes of inquiry and invitation that ever strewed the table of a young
      Guardsman; he was rarely seen anywhere in his former haunts,&mdash;when
      seen, was either alone or with Egerton; and his gay spirits seemed wholly
      to have left him. A profound melancholy was written in his countenance,
      and breathed in the listless tones of his voice. About this time a vacancy
      happening to occur for the representation of Lansmere, Harley made it his
      special request to his father that the family interest might be given to
      Audley Egerton,&mdash;a request which was backed by all the influence of
      his lady mother, who shared in the esteem which her son felt for his
      friend. The earl yielded; and Egerton, accompanied by Harley, went down to
      Lansmere Park, which adjoined the borough, in order to be introduced to
      the electors. This visit made a notable epoch in the history of many
      personages who figure in my narrative; but at present I content myself
      with saying that circumstances arose which, just as the canvass for the
      new election commenced, caused both L'Estrange and Audley to absent
      themselves from the scene of action, and that the last even wrote to Lord
      Lansmere expressing his intention of declining to contest the borough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for the parliamentary career of Audley Egerton, the election
      had become to Lord Lansmere not only a matter of public importance, but of
      personal feeling. He resolved that the battle should be fought out, even
      in the absence of the candidate, and at his own expense. Hitherto the
      contest for this distinguished borough had been, to use the language of
      Lord Lansmere, "conducted in the spirit of gentlemen,"&mdash;that is to
      say, the only opponents to the Lansmere interest had been found in one or
      the other of the two rival families in the same county; and as the earl
      was a hospitable, courteous man, much respected and liked by the
      neighbouring gentry, so the hostile candidate had always interlarded his
      speeches with profuse compliments to his Lordship's high character, and
      civil expressions as to his Lordship's candidate. But, thanks to
      successive elections, one of these two families had come to an end, and
      its actual representative was now residing within the Rules of the Bench;
      the head of the other family was the sitting member, and, by an amicable
      agreement with the Lansinere interest, he remained as neutral as it is in
      the power of any sitting member to be amidst the passions of an
      intractable committee. Accordingly it had been hoped that Egerton would
      come in without opposition, when, the very day on which he had abruptly
      left the place, a handbill, signed "Haverill Dashmore, Captain R. N.,
      Baker Street, Portman Square," announced, in very spirited language, the
      intention of that gentleman "to emancipate the borough from the
      unconstitutional domination of an oligarchical faction, not with a view to
      his own political aggrandizement,&mdash;indeed at great personal
      inconvenience,&mdash;but actuated solely by abhorrence to tyranny, and
      patriotic passion for the purity of election."
    </p>
    <p>
      This announcement was followed, within two hours, by the arrival of
      Captain Dashmore himself, in a carriage and four, covered with yellow
      favours, and filled, inside and out, with harumscarum-looking friends, who
      had come down with him to share the canvass and partake the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Dashmore was a thorough sailor, who had, however, conceived a
      disgust to the profession from the date in which a minister's nephew had
      been appointed to the command of a ship to which the captain considered
      himself unquestionably entitled. It is just to the minister to add that
      Captain Dashmore had shown as little regard for orders from a distance as
      had immortalized Nelson himself; but then the disobedience had not
      achieved the same redeeming success as that of Nelson, and Captain
      Dashmore ought to have thought himself fortunate in escaping a severer
      treatment than the loss of promotion. But no man knows when he is well
      off; and retiring on half pay, just as he came into unexpected possession
      of some forty or fifty thousand pounds, bequeathed by a distant relation,
      Captain Dashmore was seized with a vindictive desire to enter parliament,
      and inflict oratorical chastisement on the Administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few hours sufficed to show the sea-captain to be a most capital
      electioneerer for a popular but not enlightened constituency. It is true
      that he talked the saddest nonsense ever heard from an open window; but
      then his jokes were so broad, his manner so hearty, his voice so big, that
      in those dark days, before the schoolmaster was abroad, he would have
      beaten your philosophical Radical and moralizing Democrat hollow.
      Moreover, he kissed all the women, old and young, with the zest of a
      sailor who has known what it is to be three years at sea without sight of
      a beardless lip; he threw open all the public-houses, asked a numerous
      committee every day to dinner, and, chucking his purse up in the air,
      declared "he would stick to his guns while there was a shot in the
      locker." Till then, there had been but little political difference between
      the candidate supported by Lord Lansmere's interest and the opposing
      parties; for country gentlemen, in those days, were pretty much of the
      same way of thinking, and the question had been really local,&mdash;namely,
      whether the Lansmere interest should or should not prevail over that of
      the two squire-archical families who had alone, hitherto, ventured to
      oppose it. But though Captain Dashmore was really a very loyal man, and
      much too old a sailor to think that the State (which, according to
      established metaphor, is a vessel par excellence) should admit Jack upon
      quarterdeck, yet, what with talking against lords and aristocracy, jobs
      and abuses, and searching through no very refined vocabulary for the
      strongest epithets to apply to those irritating nouns-substantive, his
      bile had got the better of his understanding, and he became fuddled, as it
      were, by his own eloquence. Thus, though as innocent of Jacobinical
      designs as he was incapable of setting the Thames on fire, you would have
      guessed him, by his speeches, to be one of the most determined
      incendiaries that ever applied a match to the combustible materials of a
      contested election; while, being by no means accustomed to respect his
      adversaries, he could not have treated the Earl of Lansmere with less
      ceremony if his Lordship had been a Frenchman. He usually designated that
      respectable nobleman, who was still in the prime of life, by the title of
      "Old Pompous;" and the mayor, who was never seen abroad but in top-boots,
      and the solicitor, who was of a large build, received from his irreverent
      wit the joint sobriquet of "Tops and Bottoms"! Hence the election had now
      become, as I said before, a personal matter with my Lord, and, indeed,
      with the great heads of the Lansmere interest. The earl seemed to consider
      his very coronet at stake in the question. "The Man from Baker Street,"
      with his preternatural audacity, appeared to him a being ominous and awful&mdash;not
      so much to be regarded with resentment as with superstitious terror. He
      felt as felt the dignified Montezuma, when that ruffianly Cortez, with his
      handful of Spanish rapscallions, bearded him in his own capital, and in
      the midst of his Mexican splendour. The gods were menaced if man could be
      so insolent! wherefore, said my Lord tremulously, "The Constitution is
      gone if the Man from Baker Street comes in for Lansmere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the absence of Audley Egerton, the election looked extremely ugly,
      and Captain Dashmore gained ground hourly, when the Lansmere solicitor
      happily bethought him of a notable proxy for the missing candidate. The
      Squire of Hazeldean, with his young wife, had been invited by the earl in
      honour of Audley; and in the squire the solicitor beheld the only mortal
      who could cope with the sea-captain,&mdash;a man with a voice as burly and
      a face as bold; a man who, if permitted for the nonce by Mrs. Hazeldean,
      would kiss all the women no less heartily than the captain kissed them;
      and who was, moreover, a taller and a handsomer and a younger man,&mdash;all
      three great recommendations in the kissing department of a contested
      election. Yes, to canvass the borough, and to speak from the window,
      Squire Hazeldean would be even more popularly presentable than the
      London-bred and accomplished Audley Egerton himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, applied to and urged on all sides, at first said bluntly that
      he would do anything in reason to serve his brother, but that he did not
      like, for his own part, appearing, even in proxy, as a lord's nominee; and
      moreover, if he was to be sponsor for his brother, why, he must promise
      and vow, in his name, to be stanch and true to the land they lived by! And
      how could he tell that Audley, when once he got into the House, would not
      forget the land, and then he, William Hazeldean, would be made a liar, and
      look like a turncoat!
    </p>
    <p>
      But these scruples being overruled by the arguments of the gentlemen and
      the entreaties of the ladies, who took in the election that intense
      interest which those gentle creatures usually do take in all matters of
      strife and contest, the squire at length consented to confront the Man
      from Baker Street, and went accordingly into the thing with that good
      heart and old English spirit with which he went into everything whereon he
      had once made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expectations formed of the squire's capacities for popular
      electioneering were fully realized. He talked quite as much nonsense as
      Captain Dashmore on every subject except the landed interest; there he was
      great, for he knew the subject well,&mdash;knew it by the instinct that
      comes with practice, and compared to which all your showy theories are
      mere cobwebs and moonshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agricultural outvoters&mdash;many of whom, not living under Lord
      Lansmere, but being small yeomen, had hitherto prided themselves on their
      independence, and gone against my Lord&mdash;could not in their hearts go
      against one who was every inch the farmer's friend. They began to share in
      the earl's personal interest against the Man from Baker Street; and big
      fellows, with legs bigger round than Captain Dashmore's tight little body,
      and huge whips in their hands, were soon seen entering the shops,
      "intimidating the electors," as Captain Dashmore indignantly declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      These new recruits made a great difference in the musterroll of the
      Lansmere books; and when the day for polling arrived, the result was a
      fair question for even betting. At the last hour, after a neck-and-neck
      contest, Mr. Audley Egerton beat the captain by two votes; and the names
      of these voters were John Avenel, resident freeman, and his son-in-law,
      Mark Fairfield, an outvoter, who, though a Lansmere freeman, had settled
      in Hazeldean, where he had obtained the situation of head carpenter on the
      squire's estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      These votes were unexpected; for though Mark Fairfield had come to
      Lansmere on purpose to support the squire's brother, and though the
      Avenels had been always stanch supporters of the Lansmere Blue interest,
      yet a severe affliction (as to the nature of which, not desiring to sadden
      the opening of my story, I am considerately silent) had befallen both
      these persons, and they had left the town on the very day after Lord
      L'Estrange and Mr. Egerton had quitted Lansmere Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been the gratification of the squire, as a canvasser
      and a brother, at Mr. Egerton's triumph, it was much damped when, on
      leaving the dinner given in honour of the victory at the Lansmere Arms,
      and about, with no steady step, to enter a carriage which was to convey
      him to his Lordship's house, a letter was put into his hands by one of the
      gentlemen who had accompanied the captain to the scene of action; and the
      perusal of that letter, and a few whispered words from the bearer thereof,
      sent the squire back to Mrs. Hazeldean a much soberer man than she had
      ventured to hope for. The fact was, that on the day of nomination, the
      captain having honoured Mr. Hazeldean with many poetical and figurative
      appellations,&mdash;such as "Prize Ox," "Tony Lumpkin," "Blood-sucking
      Vampire," and "Brotherly Warming-Pan,"&mdash;the squire had retorted by a
      joke about "Saltwater Jack;" and the captain, who like all satirists was
      extremely susceptible and thin-skinned, could not consent to be called
      "Salt-water Jack" by a "Prize Ox" and a "Bloodsucking Vampire."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter, therefore, now conveyed to Mr. Hazeldean by a gentleman, who,
      being from the Sister Country, was deemed the most fitting accomplice in
      the honourable destruction of a brother mortal, contained nothing more nor
      less than an invitation to single combat; and the bearer thereof, with the
      suave politeness enjoined by etiquette on such well-bred homicidal
      occasions, suggested the expediency of appointing the place of meeting in
      the neighbourhood of London, in order to prevent interference from the
      suspicious authorities of Lansmere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natives of some countries&mdash;the warlike French in particular&mdash;think
      little of that formal operation which goes by the name of DUELLING.
      Indeed, they seem rather to like it than otherwise. But there is nothing
      your thorough-paced Englishman&mdash;a Hazeldean of Hazeldean&mdash;considers
      with more repugnance and aversion than that same cold-blooded ceremonial.
      It is not within the range of an Englishman's ordinary habits of thinking.
      He prefers going to law,&mdash;a much more destructive proceeding of the
      two. Nevertheless, if an Englishman must fight, why, he will fight. He
      says "It is very foolish;" he is sure "it is most unchristianlike;" he
      agrees with all that Philosophy, Preacher, and Press have laid down on the
      subject; but he makes his will, says his prayers, and goes out&mdash;like
      a heathen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It never, therefore, occurred to the squire to show the white feather upon
      this unpleasant occasion. The next day, feigning excuse to attend the sale
      of a hunting stud at Tattersall's, he ruefully went up to London, after
      taking a peculiarly affectionate leave of his wife. Indeed, the squire
      felt convinced that he should never return home except in a coffin. "It
      stands to reason," said he to himself, "that a man who has been actually
      paid by the King's Government for shooting people ever since he was a
      little boy in a midshipman's jacket, must be a dead hand at the job. I
      should not mind if it was with double-barrelled Mantons and small shot;
      but ball and pistol, they are n't human nor sportsmanlike!" However, the
      squire, after settling his worldly affairs, and hunting up an old college
      friend who undertook to be his second, proceeded to a sequestered corner
      of Wimbledon Common, and planted himself, not sideways, as one ought to do
      in such encounters (the which posture the squire swore was an unmanly way
      of shirking), but full front to the mouth of his adversary's pistol, with
      such sturdy composure that Captain Dashmore, who, though an excellent
      shot, was at bottom as good-natured a fellow as ever lived, testified his
      admiration by letting off his gallant opponent with a ball in the fleshy
      part of the shoulder, after which he declared himself perfectly satisfied.
      The parties then shook hands, mutual apologies were exchanged, and the
      squire, much to his astonishment to find himself still alive, was conveyed
      to Limmer's Hotel, where, after a considerable amount of anguish, the ball
      was extracted and the wound healed. Now it was all over, the squire felt
      very much raised in his own conceit; and when he was in a humour more than
      ordinarily fierce, that perilous event became a favourite allusion with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered, moreover, that his brother had incurred at his hand the
      most lasting obligations; and that, having procured Audley's return to
      parliament, and defended his interests at risk of his own life, he had an
      absolute right to dictate to that gentleman how to vote,&mdash;upon all
      matters, at least, connected with the landed interest. And when, not very
      long after Audley took his seat in parliament (which he did not do for
      some months), he thought proper both to vote and to speak in a manner
      wholly belying the promises the squire had made on his behalf, Mr.
      Hazeldean wrote him such a trimmer that it could not but produce an
      unconciliatory reply. Shortly afterwards the squire's exasperation reached
      the culminating point; for, having to pass through Lansmere on a
      market-day, he was hooted by the very farmers whom he had induced to vote
      for his brother; and, justly imputing the disgrace to Audley, he never
      heard the name of that traitor to the land mentioned without a heightened
      colour and an indignant expletive. M. de Ruqueville&mdash;who was the
      greatest wit of his day&mdash;had, like the squire, a half-brother, with
      whom he was not on the best of terms, and of whom he always spoke as his
      "frere de loin!" Audley Egerton was thus Squire Hazeldean's
      "distant-brother"!
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough of these explanatory antecedents,&mdash;let us return to the
      stocks.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The squire's carpenters were taken from the park pales and set to work at
      the parish stocks. Then came the painter and coloured them a beautiful
      dark blue, with white border&mdash;and a white rim round the holes&mdash;with
      an ornamental flourish in the middle. It was the gayest public edifice in
      the whole village, though the village possessed no less than three other
      monuments of the Vitruvian genius of the Hazeldeans,&mdash;to wit, the
      almshouse, the school, and the parish pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more elegant, enticing, coquettish pair of stocks never gladdened the
      eye of a justice of the peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Squire Hazeldean's eye was gladdened. In the pride of his heart he
      brought all the family down to look at the stocks. The squire's family
      (omitting the frere de loin) consisted of Mrs. Hazeldean, his wife; next,
      of Miss Jemima Hazeldean, his first cousin; thirdly, of Mr. Francis
      Hazeldean, his only son; and fourthly, of Captain Barnabas Higginbotham, a
      distant relation,&mdash;who, indeed, strictly speaking, was not of the
      family, but only a visitor ten months in the year. Mrs. Hazeldean was
      every inch the lady,&mdash;the lady of the parish. In her comely, florid,
      and somewhat sunburned countenance, there was an equal expression of
      majesty and benevolence; she had a blue eye that invited liking, and an
      aquiline nose that commanded respect. Mrs. Hazeldean had no affectation of
      fine airs, no wish to be greater and handsomer and cleverer than she was.
      She knew herself, and her station, and thanked Heaven for it. There was
      about her speech and manner something of the shortness and bluntness which
      often characterizes royalty; and if the lady of a parish is not a queen in
      her own circle, it is never the fault of a parish. Mrs. Hazeldean dressed
      her part to perfection. She wore silks that seemed heirlooms,&mdash;so
      thick were they, so substantial and imposing; and over these, when she was
      in her own domain, the whitest of aprons; while at her waist was seen no
      fiddle-faddle chatelaine, with breloques and trumpery, but a good honest
      gold watch to mark the time, and a long pair of scissors to cut off the
      dead leaves from her flowers,&mdash;for she was a great horticulturalist.
      When occasion needed, Mrs. Hazeldean could, however, lay by her more
      sumptuous and imperial raiment for a stout riding-habit, of blue Saxony,
      and canter by her husband's side to see the hounds throw off. Nay, on the
      days on which Mr. Hazeldean drove his famous fast-trotting cob to the
      market town, it was rarely that you did not see his wife on the left side
      of the gig. She cared as little as her lord did for wind and weather, and
      in the midst of some pelting shower her pleasant face peeped over the
      collar and capes of a stout dreadnought, expanding into smiles and bloom
      as some frank rose, that opens from its petals, and rejoices in the dews.
      It was easy to see that the worthy couple had married for love; they were
      as little apart as they could help it. And still, on the first of
      September, if the house was not full of company which demanded her cares,
      Mrs. Hazeldean "stepped out" over the stubbles by her husband's side, with
      as light a tread and as blithe an eye as when, in the first bridal year,
      she had enchanted the squire by her genial sympathy with his sports.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there now stands Harriet Hazeldean, one hand leaning on the squire's
      broad shoulder, the other thrust into her apron, and trying her best to
      share her husband's enthusiasm for his own public-spirited patriotism, in
      the renovation of the parish stocks. A little behind, with two fingers
      resting on the thin arm of Captain Barnabas, stood Miss Jemima, the orphan
      daughter of the squire's uncle, by a runaway imprudent marriage with a
      young lady who belonged to a family which had been at war with the
      Hazeldeans since the reign of Charles the First respecting a right of way
      to a small wood (or rather spring) of about an acre, through a piece of
      furze land, which was let to a brickmaker at twelve shillings a year. The
      wood belonged to the Hazeldeans, the furze land to the Sticktorights (an
      old Saxon family, if ever there was one). Every twelfth year, when the
      fagots and timber were felled, this feud broke out afresh; for the
      Sticktorights refused to the Hazeldeans the right to cart off the said
      fagots and timber through the only way by which a cart could possibly
      pass. It is just to the Hazeldeans to say that they had offered to buy the
      land at ten times its value. But the Sticktorights, with equal
      magnanimity, had declared that they would not "alienate the family
      property for the convenience of the best squire that ever stood upon shoe
      leather." Therefore, every twelfth year, there was always a great breach
      of the peace on the part of both Hazeldeans and Sticktorights, magistrates
      and deputy-lieutenants though they were. The question was fairly fought
      out by their respective dependants, and followed by various actions for
      assault and trespass. As the legal question of right was extremely
      obscure, it never had been properly decided; and, indeed, neither party
      wished it to be decided, each at heart having some doubt of the propriety
      of its own claim. A marriage between a younger son of the Hazeldeans and a
      younger daughter of the Sticktorights was viewed with equal indignation by
      both families; and the consequence had been that the runaway couple,
      unblessed and unforgiven, had scrambled through life as they could, upon
      the scanty pay of the husband, who was in a marching regiment, and the
      interest of L1000, which was the wife's fortune independent of her
      parents. They died and left an only daughter (upon whom the maternal L1000
      had been settled), about the time that the squire came of age and into
      possession of his estates. And though he inherited all the ancestral
      hostility towards the Sticktorights, it was not in his nature to be unkind
      to a poor orphan, who was, after all, the child of a Hazeldean. Therefore
      he had educated and fostered Jemima with as much tenderness as if she had
      been his sister; put out her L1000 at nurse, and devoted, from the ready
      money which had accrued from the rents during his minority, as much as
      made her fortune (with her own accumulated at compound interest) no less
      than L4000, the ordinary marriage portion of the daughters of Hazeldean.
      On her coming of age, he transferred this sum to her absolute disposal, in
      order that she might feel herself independent, see a little more of the
      world than she could at Hazeldean, have candidates to choose from if she
      deigned to marry; or enough to live upon, if she chose to remain single.
      Miss Jemima had somewhat availed herself of this liberty, by occasional
      visits to Cheltenham and other watering-places. But her grateful affection
      to the squire was such that she could never bear to be long away from the
      Hall. And this was the more praise to her heart, inasmuch as she was far
      from taking kindly to the prospect of being an old maid; and there were so
      few bachelors in the neighbourhood of Hazeldean, that she could not but
      have that prospect before her eyes whenever she looked out of the Hall
      windows. Miss Jemima was indeed one of the most kindly and affectionate of
      beings feminine; and if she disliked the thought of single blessedness, it
      really was from those innocent and womanly instincts towards the tender
      charities of hearth and home, without which a lady, however otherwise
      estimable, is little better than a Minerva in bronze. But, whether or not,
      despite her fortune and her face, which last, though not strictly
      handsome, was pleasing, and would have been positively pretty if she had
      laughed more often (for when she laughed, there appeared three charming
      dimples, invisible when she was grave),&mdash;whether or not, I say, it
      was the fault of our insensibility or her own fastidiousness, Miss Jemima
      approached her thirtieth year, and was still Miss Jemima. Now, therefore,
      that beautifying laugh of hers was very rarely heard, and she had of late
      become confirmed in two opinions, not at all conducive to laughter. One
      was a conviction of the general and progressive wickedness of the male
      sex, and the other was a decided and lugubrious belief that the world was
      coming to an end. Miss Jemima was now accompanied by a small canine
      favourite, true Blenheim, with a snub nose. It was advanced in life, and
      somewhat obese. It sat on its haunches, with its tongue out of its mouth,
      except when it snapped at the flies. There was a strong platonic
      friendship between Miss Jemima and Captain Barnabas Higginbotham; for he,
      too, was unmarried, and he had the same ill opinion of your sex, my dear
      madam, that Miss Jemima had of, ours. The captain was a man of a slim and
      elegant figure; the less said about the face the better, a truth of which
      the captain himself was sensible, for it was a favourite maxim of his,
      "that in a man, everything is a slight, gentlemanlike figure." Captain
      Barnabas did not absolutely deny that the world was coming to an end, only
      he thought it would last his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite apart from all the rest, with the nonchalant survey of virgin
      dandyism, Francis Hazeldean looked over one of the high starched
      neckcloths which were then the fashion,&mdash;a handsome lad, fresh from
      Eton for the summer holidays, but at that ambiguous age when one disdains
      the sports of the boy, and has not yet arrived at the resources of the
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be glad, Frank," said the squire, suddenly turning round to his
      son, "to see you take a little more interest in duties which, one day or
      other, you may be called upon to discharge. I can't bear to think that the
      property should fall into the hands of a fine gentleman, who will let
      things go to rack and ruin, instead of keeping them up as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the squire pointed to the stocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Frank's eye followed the direction of the cane, as well as his
      cravat would permit; and he said dryly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; but how came the stocks to be so long out of repair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because one can't see to everything at once," retorted the squire,
      tartly. "When a man has got eight thousand acres to look after, he must do
      a bit at a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Captain Barnabas. "I know that by experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce you do!" cried the squire, bluntly. "Experience in eight
      thousand acres!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; in my apartments in the Albany,&mdash;No. 3 A. I have had them ten
      years, and it was only last Christmas that I bought my Japan cat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," said Miss Jemima; "a Japan cat! that must be very curious. What
      sort of a creature is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know? Bless me, a thing with three legs, and holds toast! I
      never thought of it, I assure you, till my friend Cosey said to me one
      morning when he was breakfasting at my rooms, 'Higginbotham, how is it
      that you, who like to have things comfortable about you, don't have a
      cat?' 'Upon my life,' said I, 'one can't think of everything at a time,'&mdash;just
      like you, Squire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw," said Mr. Hazeldean, gruffly, "not at all like me. And I'll thank
      you another time, Cousin Higginbotham, not to put me out when I'm speaking
      on matters of importance; poking your cat into my stocks! They look
      something like now, my stocks, don't they, Harry? I declare that the whole
      village seems more respectable. It is astonishing how much a little
      improvement adds to the&mdash;to the&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charm of the landscape," put in Miss Jemina, sentimentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire neither accepted nor rejected the suggested termination; but
      leaving his sentence uncompleted, broke suddenly off with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I had listened to Parson Dale&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would have done a very wise thing," said a voice behind, as the
      parson presented himself in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wise thing? Why, surely, Mr. Dale," said Mrs. Hazeldean, with spirit, for
      she always resented the least contradiction to her lord and master&mdash;perhaps
      as an interference with her own special right and prerogative!&mdash;"why,
      surely if it is necessary to have stocks, it is necessary to repair them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right! go it, Harry!" cried the squire, chuckling, and rubbing his
      hands as if he had been setting his terrier at the parson: "St&mdash;St&mdash;at
      him! Well, Master Dale, what do you say to that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear ma'am," said the parson, replying in preference to the lady,
      "there are many institutions in the country which are very old, look very
      decayed, and don't seem of much use; but I would not pull them down for
      all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would reform them, then," said Mrs. Hazeldean, doubtfully, and with a
      look at her husband, as much as to say, "He is on politics now,&mdash;that's
      your business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I would not, ma'am," said the parson, stoutly. "What on earth would
      you do, then?" quoth the squire. "Just let 'em alone," said the parson.
      "Master Frank, there's a Latin maxim which was often put in the mouth of
      Sir Robert Walpole, and which they ought to put into the Eton grammar,
      'Quieta non movere.' If things are quiet, let them be quiet! I would not
      destroy the stocks, because that might seem to the ill-disposed like a
      license to offend; and I would not repair the stocks, because that puts it
      into people's heads to get into them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire was a stanch politician of the old school, and he did not like
      to think that, in repairing the stocks, he had perhaps been conniving at
      revolutionary principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This constant desire of innovation," said Miss Jemima, suddenly mounting
      the more funereal of her two favourite hobbies, "is one of the great
      symptoms of the approaching crash. We are altering and mending and
      reforming, when in twenty years at the utmost the world itself may be
      destroyed!" The fair speaker paused, and Captain Barnabas said
      thoughtfully, "Twenty years!&mdash;the insurance officers rarely compute
      the best life at more than fourteen." He struck his hand on the stocks as
      he spoke, and added, with his usual consolatory conclusion, "The odds are
      that it will last our time, Squire."
    </p>
    <p>
      But whether Captain Barnabas meant the stocks or the world he did not
      clearly explain, and no one took the trouble to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Master Frank to his father, with that furtive spirit of
      quizzing, which he had acquired amongst other polite accomplishments at
      Eton,&mdash;"sir, it is no use now considering whether the stocks should
      or should not have been repaired. The only question is, whom you will get
      to put into them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said the squire, with much gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there it is!" said the parson, mournfully. "If you would but learn
      'non quieta movere'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't spout your Latin at me, Parson," cried the squire, angrily; "I can
      give you as good as you bring, any day.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "'Propria quae maribus tribuuntur mascula dicas.&mdash;
     As in praesenti, perfectum format in avi.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "There," added the squire, turning triumphantly towards his Harry, who
      looked with great admiration at this unprecedented burst of learning on
      the part of Mr. Hazeldean,&mdash;"there, two can play at that game! And
      now that we have all seen the stocks, we may as well go home and drink
      tea. Will you come up and play a rubber, Dale? No! hang it, man, I've not
      offended you?&mdash;you know my ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I do, and they are among the things I would not have altered," cried
      the parson, holding out his hand cheerfully. The squire gave it a hearty
      shake, and Mrs. Hazeldean hastened to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do come; I am afraid we've been very rude: we are sad blunt folks. Do
      come; that's a dear good man; and of course poor Mrs. Dale too." Mrs.
      Hazeldean's favourite epithet for Mrs. Dale was poor, and that for reasons
      to be explained hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear my wife has got one of her bad headaches, but I will give her your
      kind message, and at all events you may depend upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right," said the squire; "in half an hour, eh? How d' ye do, my
      little man?" as Lenny Fairfield, on his way home from some errand in the
      village, drew aside and pulled off his hat with both hands. "Stop; you see
      those stocks, eh? Tell all the bad boys in the parish to take care how
      they get into them&mdash;a sad disgrace&mdash;you'll never be in such a
      quandary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That at least I will answer for," said the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I too," added Mrs. Hazeldean, patting the boy's curly head. "Tell
      your mother I shall come and have a good chat with her to-morrow evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the party passed on, and Lenny stood still on the road, staring
      hard at the stocks, which stared back at him from its four great eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put Lenny did not remain long alone. As soon as the great folks had fairly
      disappeared, a large number of small folks emerged timorously from the
      neighbouring cottages, and approached the site of the stocks with much
      marvel, fear, and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the renovated appearance of this monster a propos de bottes, as
      one may say&mdash;had already excited considerable sensation among the
      population of Hazeldean. And even as when an unexpected owl makes his
      appearance in broad daylight all the little birds rise from tree and
      hedgerow, and cluster round their ominous enemy, so now gathered all the
      much-excited villagers round the intrusive and portentous phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D' ye know what the diggins the squire did it for, Gaffer Solomons?"
      asked one many-childed matron, with a baby in arms, an urchin of three
      years old clinging fast to her petticoat, and her hand maternally holding
      back a more adventurous hero of six, who had a great desire to thrust his
      head into one of the grisly apertures. All eyes turned to a sage old man,
      the oracle of the village, who, leaning both hands on his crutch, shook
      his head bodingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maw be," said Gaffer Solomons, "some of the boys ha' been robbing the
      orchards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Orchards!" cried a big lad, who seemed to think himself personally
      appealed to; "why, the bud's scarce off the trees yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more it ain't," said the dame with many children, and she breathed
      more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maw be," said Gaffer Solomons, "some o' ye has been sitting snares."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" said a stout, sullen-looking young fellow, whom conscience
      possibly pricked to reply,&mdash;"what for, when it bean't the season? And
      if a poor man did find a hear in his pocket i' the haytime, I should like
      to know if ever a squire in the world would let 'un off with the stocks,
      eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This last question seemed a settler, and the wisdom of Gaffer Solomons
      went down fifty per cent in the public opinion of Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maw be," said the gaffer&mdash;this time with a thrilling effect, which
      restored his reputation,&mdash;"maw be some o' ye ha' been getting drunk,
      and making beestises o' yoursel's!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead pause, for this suggestion applied too generally to be
      met with a solitary response. At last one of the women said, with a
      meaning glance at her husband,
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless the squire; he'll make some on us happy women if that's all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There then arose an almost unanimous murmur of approbation among the
      female part of the audience; and the men looked at each other, and then at
      the phenomenon, with a very hang-dog expression of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, maw be," resumed Gaffer Solomons, encouraged to a fourth suggestion
      by the success of its predecessor,&mdash;"maw be some o' the misseses ha'
      been making a rumpus, and scolding their good men. I heard say in my
      granfeyther's time, arter old Mother Bang nigh died o' the ducking-stool,
      them 'ere stocks were first made for the women, out o' compassion like!
      And every one knows the squire is a koind-hearted man, God bless 'un!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless 'un!" cried the men, heartily; and they gathered lovingly round
      the phenomenon, like heathens of old round a tutelary temple. But then
      there rose one shrill clamour among the females as they retreated with
      involuntary steps towards the verge of the green, whence they glared at
      Solomons and the phenomenon with eyes so sparkling, and pointed at both
      with gestures so menacing, that Heaven only knows if a morsel of either
      would have remained much longer to offend the eyes of the justly-enraged
      matronage of Hazeldean, if fortunately Master Stirn, the squire's
      right-hand man, had not come up in the nick of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Stirn was a formidable personage,&mdash;more formidable than the
      squire himself,&mdash;as, indeed, a squire's right hand is generally more
      formidable than the head can pretend to be. He inspired the greater awe,
      because, like the stocks of which he was deputed guardian, his powers were
      undefined and obscure, and he had no particular place in the out-of-door
      establishment. He was not the steward, yet he did much of what ought to be
      the steward's work; he was not the farm-bailiff, for the squire called
      himself his own farm-bailiff; nevertheless, Mr. Hazeldean sowed and
      ploughed, cropped and stocked, bought and sold, very much as Mr. Stirn
      condescended to advise. He was not the park-keeper, for he neither shot
      the deer nor superintended the preserves; but it was he who always found
      out who had broken a park pale or snared a rabbit. In short, what may be
      called all the harsher duties of a large landed proprietor devolved, by
      custom and choice, upon Mr. Stirn. If a labourer was to be discharged or a
      rent enforced, and the squire knew that he should be talked over, and that
      the steward would be as soft as himself, Mr. Stirn was sure to be the
      avenging messenger, to pronounce the words of fate; so that he appeared to
      the inhabitants of Hazeldean like the poet's Saeva Necessitas, a vague
      incarnation of remorseless power, armed with whips, nails, and wedges. The
      very brute creation stood in awe of Mr. Stirn. The calves knew that it was
      he who singled out which should be sold to the butcher, and huddled up
      into a corner with beating hearts at his grim footstep; the sow grunted,
      the duck quacked, the hen bristled her feathers and called to her chicks
      when Mr. Stirn drew near. Nature had set her stamp upon him. Indeed, it
      may be questioned whether the great M. de Chambray himself, surnamed the
      brave, had an aspect so awe-inspiring as that of Mr. Stirn; albeit the
      face of that hero was so terrible, that a man who had been his lackey,
      seeing his portrait after he had been dead twenty years, fell a trembling
      all over like a leaf!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what the plague are you doing here?" said Mr. Stirn, as he waved and
      smacked a great cart-whip which he held in his hand, "making such a
      hullabaloo, you women, you! that I suspect the squire will be sending out
      to know if the village is on fire. Go home, will ye? High time indeed to
      have the stocks ready, when you get squalling and conspiring under the
      very nose of a justice of the peace, just as the French revolutioners did
      afore they cut off their king's head! My hair stands on end to look at
      ye." But already, before half this address was delivered, the crowd had
      dispersed in all directions,&mdash;the women still keeping together, and
      the men sneaking off towards the ale-house. Such was the beneficent effect
      of the fatal stocks on the first day of their resuscitation. However, in
      the break up of every crowd there must always be one who gets off the
      last; and it so happened that our friend Lenny Fairfield, who had
      mechanically approached close to the stocks, the better to hear the
      oracular opinions of Gaffer Solomons, had no less mechanically, on the
      abrupt appearance of Mr. Stirn, crept, as he hoped, out of sight behind
      the trunk of the elm-tree which partially shaded the stocks; and there
      now, as if fascinated, he still cowered, not daring to emerge in full view
      of Mr. Stirn, and in immediate reach of the cartwhip, when the quick eye
      of the right-hand man detected his retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, sir&mdash;what the deuce, laying a mine to blow up the stocks!
      just like Guy Fox and the Gunpowder Plot, I declares! What ha' you got in
      your willanous little fist there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, sir," said Lenny, opening his palm. "Nothing&mdash;um!" said Mr.
      Stirn, much dissatisfied; and then, as he gazed more deliberately,
      recognizing the pattern boy of the village, a cloud yet darker gathered
      over his brow; for Mr. Stirn, who valued himself much on his learning, and
      who, indeed, by dint of more knowledge as well as more wit than his
      neighbours, had attained his present eminent station of life, was
      extremely anxious that his only son should also be a scholar. That wish&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "The gods dispersed in empty air."
</pre>
    <p>
      Master Stirn was a notable dunce at the parson's school, while Lenny
      Fairfield was the pride and boast of it; therefore Mr. Stirn was
      naturally, and almost justifiably, ill-disposed towards Lenny Fairfield,
      who had appropriated to himself the praises which Mr. Stirn had designed
      for his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um!" said the right-hand man, glowering on Lenny malignantly, "you are
      the pattern boy of the village, are you? Very well, sir! then I put these
      here stocks under your care, and you'll keep off the other boys from
      sitting on 'em, and picking off the paint, and playing three-holes and
      chuck-farthing, as I declare they've been a doing, just in front of the
      elewation. Now, you knows your 'sponsibilities, little boy,&mdash;and a
      great honour they are too, for the like o' you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If any damage be done, it is to you I shall look; d' ye understand?&mdash;and
      that's what the squire says to me. So you sees what it is to be a pattern
      boy, Master Lenny!" With that Mr. Stirn gave a loud crack of the
      cart-whip, by way of military honours, over the head of the vicegerent he
      had thus created, and strode off to pay a visit to two young unsuspecting
      pups, whose ears and tails he had graciously promised their proprietors to
      crop that evening. Nor, albeit few charges could be more obnoxious than
      that of deputy-governor or charge-d'affaires extraordinaires to the parish
      stocks, nor one more likely to render Lenny Fairfield odious to his
      contemporaries, ought he to have been insensible to the signal advantage
      of his condition over that of the two sufferers, against whose ears and
      tails Mr. Stirn had no special motives of resentment. To every bad there
      is a worse; and fortunately for little boys, and even for grown men, whom
      the Stirns of the world regard malignly, the majesty and law protect their
      ears, and the merciful forethought of nature deprived their remote
      ancestors of the privilege of entailing tails upon them. Had it been
      otherwise&mdash;considering what handles tails would have given to the
      oppressor, how many traps envy would have laid for them, how often they
      must have been scratched and mutilated by the briars of life, how many
      good excuses would have been found for lopping, docking, and trimming them&mdash;I
      fear that only the lap-dogs of Fortune would have gone to the grave
      tail-whole.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The card-table was set out in the drawing-room at Hazeldean Hall; though
      the little party were still lingering in the deep recess of the large bay
      window, which (in itself of dimensions that would have swallowed up a
      moderate-sized London parlour) held the great round tea-table, with all
      appliances and means to boot,&mdash;for the beautiful summer moon shed on
      the sward so silvery a lustre, and the trees cast so quiet a shadow, and
      the flowers and new-mown hay sent up so grateful a perfume, that to close
      the windows, draw the curtains, and call for other lights than those of
      heaven would have been an abuse of the prose of life which even Captain
      Barnabas, who regarded whist as the business of town and the holiday of
      the country, shrank from suggesting. Without, the scene, beheld by the
      clear moonlight, had the beauty peculiar to the garden-ground round those
      old-fashioned country residences which, though a little modernized, still
      preserve their original character,&mdash;the velvet lawn, studded with
      large plots of flowers, shaded and scented, here to the left by lilacs,
      laburnums, and rich syringas; there, to the right, giving glimpses, over
      low clipped yews, of a green bowling-alley, with the white columns of a
      summer-house built after the Dutch taste, in the reign of William III.;
      and in front stealing away under covert of those still cedars, into the
      wilder landscape of the well-wooded undulating park. Within, viewed by the
      placid glimmer of the moon, the scene was no less characteristic of the
      abodes of that race which has no parallel in other lands, and which, alas!
      is somewhat losing its native idiosyncrasies in this,&mdash;the stout
      country gentleman, not the fine gentleman of the country; the country
      gentleman somewhat softened and civilized from the mere sportsman or
      farmer, but still plain and homely; relinquishing the old hall for the
      drawing-room, and with books not three months old on his table, instead of
      Fox's "Martyrs" and Baker's "Chronicle," yet still retaining many a sacred
      old prejudice, that, like the knots in his native oak, rather adds to the
      ornament of the grain than takes from the strength of the tree. Opposite
      to the window, the high chimneypiece rose to the heavy cornice of the
      ceiling, with dark panels glistening against the moonlight. The broad and
      rather clumsy chintz sofas and settees of the reign of George III.
      contrasted at intervals with the tall-backed chairs of a far more distant
      generation, when ladies in fardingales and gentlemen in trunk-hose seem
      never to have indulged in horizontal positions. The walls, of shining
      wainscot, were thickly covered, chiefly with family pictures; though now
      and then some Dutch fair or battle-piece showed that a former proprietor
      had been less exclusive in his taste for the arts. The pianoforte stood
      open near the fireplace; a long dwarf bookcase at the far end added its
      sober smile to the room. That bookcase contained what was called "The
      Lady's Library,"&mdash;a collection commenced by the squire's grandmother,
      of pious memory, and completed by his mother, who had more taste for the
      lighter letters, with but little addition from the bibliomaniac tendencies
      of the present Mrs. Hazeldean, who, being no great reader, contented
      herself with subscribing to the Book Club. In this feminine Bodleian, the
      sermons collected by Mrs. Hazeldean, the grandmother, stood cheek-by-jowl
      beside the novels purchased by Mrs. Hazeldean, the mother,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "Mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho!"
</pre>
    <p>
      But, to be sure, the novels, in spite of very inflammatory titles, such as
      "Fatal Sensibility," "Errors of the Heart," etc., were so harmless that I
      doubt if the sermons could have had much to say against their next-door
      neighbours,&mdash;and that is all that can be expected by the best of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      A parrot dozing on his perch; some goldfish fast asleep in their glass
      bowl; two or three dogs on the rug, and Flimsey, Miss Jemima's spaniel,
      curled into a ball on the softest sofa; Mrs. Hazeldean's work-table rather
      in disorder, as if it had been lately used; the "St. James's Chronicle"
      dangling down from a little tripod near the squire's armchair; a high
      screen of gilt and stamped leather fencing off the card-table,&mdash;all
      these, dispersed about a room large enough to hold them all and not seem
      crowded, offered many a pleasant resting-place for the eye, when it turned
      from the world of nature to the home of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But see, Captain Barnabas, fortified by his fourth cup of tea, has at
      length summoned courage to whisper to Mrs. Hazeldean, "Don't you think the
      parson will be impatient for his rubber?" Mrs. Hazeldean glanced at the
      parson and smiled; but she gave the signal to the captain, and the bell
      was rung, lights were brought in, the curtains let down; in a few moments
      more, the group had collected round the cardtable. The best of us are but
      human&mdash;that is not a new truth, I confess, but yet people forget it
      every day of their lives&mdash;and I dare say there are many who are
      charitably thinking at this very moment that my parson ought not to be
      playing at whist. All I can say to those rigid disciplinarians is, "Every
      man has his favourite sin: whist was Parson Dale's!&mdash;ladies and
      gentlemen, what is yours?" In truth, I must not set up my poor parson,
      nowadays, as a pattern parson,&mdash;it is enough to have one pattern in a
      village no bigger than Hazeldean, and we all know that Lenny Fairfield has
      bespoken that place, and got the patronage of the stocks for his
      emoluments! Parson Dale was ordained, not indeed so very long ago, but
      still at a time when Churchmen took it a great deal more easily than they
      do now. The elderly parson of that day played his rubber as a matter of
      course, the middle-aged parson was sometimes seen riding to cover (I knew
      a schoolmaster, a doctor of divinity, and an excellent man, whose pupils
      were chiefly taken from the highest families in England, who hunted
      regularly three times a week during the season), and the young parson
      would often sing a capital song&mdash;not composed by David&mdash;and join
      in those rotatory dances, which certainly David never danced before the
      ark.

    <p>
      Does it need so long an exordium to excuse thee, poor Parson Dale, for
      turning up that ace of spades with so triumphant a smile at thy partner? I
      must own that nothing which could well add to the parson's offence was
      wanting. In the first place, he did not play charitably, and merely to
      oblige other people. He delighted in the game, he rejoiced in the game,
      his whole heart was in the game,&mdash;neither was he indifferent to the
      mammon of the thing, as a Christian pastor ought to have been. He looked
      very sad when he took his shillings out of his purse, and exceedingly
      pleased when he put the shillings that had just before belonged to other
      people into it. Finally, by one of those arrangements common with married
      people who play at the same table, 'Mr. and&mdash;Mrs. Hazeldean were
      invariably partners, and no two people could play worse; while Captain
      Barnabas, who had played at Graham's with honour and profit, necessarily
      became partner to Parson Dale, who himself played a good steady parsonic
      game. So that, in strict truth, it was hardly fair play; it was almost
      swindling,&mdash;the combination of these two great dons against that
      innocent married couple! Mr. Dale, it is true, was aware of this
      disproportion of force, and had often proposed either to change partners
      or to give odds,&mdash;propositions always scornfully scouted by the
      squire and his lady, so that the parson was obliged to pocket his
      conscience, together with the ten points which made his average winnings.
    </p>

      The strangest thing in the world is the different way in which whist
      affects the temper. It is no test of temper, as some pretend,&mdash;not at
      all! The best-tempered people in the world grow snappish at whist; and I
      have seen the most testy and peevish in the ordinary affairs of life bear
      their losses with the stoicism of Epictetus. This was notably manifested
      in the contrast between the present adversaries of the Hall and the
      Rectory. The squire, who was esteemed as choleric a gentleman as most in
      the county, was the best-humoured fellow you could imagine when you set
      him down to whist opposite the sunny face of his wife. You never heard one
      of those incorrigible blunderers scold each other; on the contrary, they
      only laughed when they threw away the game, with four by honours in their
      hands. The utmost that was ever said was a "Well, Harry, that was the
      oddest trump of yours. Ho, ho, ho!" or a "Bless me, Hazeldean&mdash;why,
      they made three tricks in clubs, and you had the ace in your hand all the
      time! Ha, ha, ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which occasions Captain Barnabas, with great goodhumour, always
      echoed both the squire's Ho, ho, ho! and Mrs. Hazeldean's Ha, ha, ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so the parson. He had so keen and sportsmanlike an interest in the
      game, that even his adversaries' mistakes ruffled him. And you would hear
      him, with elevated voice and agitated gestures, laying down the law,
      quoting Hoyle, appealing to all the powers of memory and common-sense
      against the very delinquencies by which he was enriched,&mdash;a waste of
      eloquence that always heightened the hilarity of Mr. and Mrs. Hazeldean.
      While these four were thus engaged, Mrs. Dale, who had come with her
      husband despite her headache, sat on the sofa beside Miss Jemima, or
      rather beside Miss Jemima's Flimsey, which had already secured the centre
      of the sofa, and snarled at the very idea of being disturbed. And Master
      Frank&mdash;at a table by himself&mdash;was employed sometimes in looking
      at his pumps and sometimes at Gilray's Caricatures, which his mother had
      provided for his intellectual requirements. Mrs. Dale, in her heart, liked
      Miss Jemima better than Mrs. Hazeldean, of whom she was rather in awe,
      notwithstanding they had been little girls together, and occasionally
      still called each other Harry and Carry. But those tender diminutives
      belonged to the "Dear" genus, and were rarely employed by the ladies,
      except at times when, had they been little girls still, and the governess
      out of the way, they would have slapped and pinched each other. Mrs. Dale
      was still a very pretty woman, as Mrs. Hazeldean was still a very fine
      woman. Mrs. Dale painted in water-colours, and sang, and made card-racks
      and penholders, and was called an "elegant, accomplished woman;" Mrs.
      Hazeldean cast up the squire's accounts, wrote the best part of his
      letters, kept a large establishment in excellent order, and was called "a
      clever, sensible woman." Mrs. Dale had headaches and nerves; Mrs.
      Hazeldean had neither nerves nor headaches. Mrs. Dale said, "Harry had no
      real harm in her, but was certainly very masculine;" Mrs. Hazeldean said,
      "Carry would be a good creature but for her airs and graces." Mrs. Dale
      said Mrs. Hazeldean was "just made to be a country squire's lady;" Mrs.
      Hazeldean said, "Mrs. Dale was the last person in the world who ought to
      have been a parson's wife." Carry, when she spoke of Harry to a third
      person, said, "Dear Mrs. Hazeldean;" Harry, when she referred incidentally
      to Carry, said, "Poor Mrs. Dale." And now the reader knows why Mrs.
      Hazeldean called Mrs. Dale "poor,"&mdash;at least as well as I do. For,
      after all, the word belonged to that class in the female vocabulary which
      may be called "obscure significants," resembling the Konx Ompax, which
      hath so puzzled the inquirers into the Eleusinian Mysteries: the
      application is rather to be illustrated than the meaning to be exactly
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's really a sweet little dog of yours, Jemima," said Mrs. Dale, who
      was embroidering the word CAROLINE on the border of a cambric pocket
      handkerchief; but edging a little farther off, as she added, "he'll not
      bite, will he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, no!" said Miss Jemima; "but" (she added in a confidential
      whisper) "don't say he,&mdash;'t is a lady dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Mrs. Dale, edging off still farther, as if that confession of
      the creature's sex did not serve to allay her apprehensions,&mdash;"oh,
      then, you carry your aversion to the gentlemen even to lap-dogs,&mdash;that
      is being consistent indeed, Jemima!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA.&mdash;"I had a gentleman dog once,&mdash;a pug!&mdash;pugs
      are getting very scarce now. I thought he was so fond of me&mdash;he
      snapped at every one else; the battles I fought for him! Well, will you
      believe&mdash;I had been staying with my friend Miss Smilecox at
      Cheltenham. Knowing that William is so hasty, and his boots are so thick,
      I trembled to think what a kick might do. So, on coming here I left Bluff&mdash;that
      was his name&mdash;with Miss Smilecox." (A pause.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (looking up languidly).&mdash;"Well, my love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA.&mdash;"Will you believe it, I say, when I returned to
      Cheltenham, only three months afterwards, Miss Smilecox had seduced his
      affections from me, and the ungrateful creature did not even know me
      again? A pug, too&mdash;yet people say pugs are faithful! I am sure they
      ought to be, nasty things! I have never had a gentleman dog since,&mdash;they
      are all alike, believe me, heartless, selfish creatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"Pugs? I dare say they are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA (with spirit).-"MEN!&mdash;I told you it was a gentleman dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (apologetically).&mdash;"True, my love, but the whole thing was
      so mixed up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA.&mdash;"You saw that cold-blooded case of Breach of Promise of
      Marriage in the papers,&mdash;an old wretch, too, of sixty-four. No age
      makes them a bit better. And when one thinks that the end of all flesh is
      approaching, and that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (quickly, for she prefers Miss Jemima's other hobby to that
      black one upon which she is preparing to precede the bier of the
      universe).&mdash;"Yes, my love, we'll avoid that subject, if you please.
      Mr. Dale has his own opinions, and it becomes me, you know, as a parson's
      wife" (said smilingly: Mrs. Dale has as pretty a dimple as any of Miss
      Jemima's, and makes more of that one than Miss Jemima of three), "to agree
      with him,&mdash;that is, in theology."
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA (earnestly).&mdash;"But the thing is so clear, if you will but
      look into&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (putting her hand on Miss Jemima's lips playfully).&mdash;"Not a
      word more. Pray, what do you think of the squire's tenant at the Casino,
      Signor Riccabocca? An interesting creature, is he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA.&mdash;"Interesting! not to me. Interesting? Why is he
      interesting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dale is silent, and turns her handkerchief in her pretty little white
      hands, appearing to contemplate the R in Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA (half pettishly, half coaxingly).&mdash;"Why is he
      interesting? I scarcely ever looked at him; they say he smokes, and never
      eats. Ugly, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"Ugly,&mdash;no. A fine bead,&mdash;very like Dante's;
      but what is beauty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA.&mdash;"Very true: what is it indeed? Yes, as you say, I think
      there is something interesting about him; he looks melancholy, but that
      may be because he is poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"It is astonishing how little one feels poverty when one
      loves. Charles and I were very poor once,&mdash;before the squire&mdash;"
      Mrs. Dale paused, looked towards the squire, and murmured a blessing, the
      warmth of which brought tears into her eyes. "Yes," she added, after a
      pause, "we were very poor, but we were happy even then,&mdash;more thanks
      to Charles than to me;" and tears from a new source again dimmed those
      quick, lively eyes, as the little woman gazed fondly on her husband, whose
      brows were knit into a black frown over a bad hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA.&mdash;"It is only those horrid men who think of money as a
      source of happiness. I should be the last person to esteem a gentleman
      less because he was poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"I wonder the squire does not ask Signor Riccabocca here
      more often. Such an acquisition we find him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire's voice from the card-table.&mdash;"Whom ought I to ask more
      often, Mrs. Dale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Parson's voice, impatiently.&mdash;"Come, come, come, squire: play to my
      queen of diamonds,&mdash;do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"There, I trump it! pick up the trick, Mrs. H."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Stop! Stop! trump my diamond?"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAPTAIN (solemnly).&mdash;"'Trick turned; play on, Squire."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"The king of diamonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"Lord! Hazeldean, why, that's the most barefaced
      revoke,&mdash;ha, ha, ha! trump the queen of diamonds and play out the
      king! well, I never! ha, ha, ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN BARNABAS (in tenor).&mdash;"Ha, ha, ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Ho, ho, ho! bless my soul! ho, ho, ho!"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN BARNABAS (in bass).&mdash;"Ho, ho, ho!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Parson's voice raised, but drowned by the laughter of his adversaries and
      the firm, clear tone of Captain Barnabas.&mdash;"Three to our score!&mdash;game!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (wiping his eyes).&mdash;"No help for it; Harry, deal for me. Whom
      ought I to ask, Mrs. Dale?" (Waxing angry.) "First time I ever heard the
      hospitality of Hazeldean called in question!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"My dear sir, I beg a thousand pardons, but listeners&mdash;you
      know the proverb."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (growling like a bear).&mdash;"I hear nothing but proverbs ever
      since we had that Mounseer among us. Please to speak plainly, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. DALE (sliding into a little temper at being thus roughly accosted).&mdash;"It
      was of Mounseer, as you call him, that I spoke, Mr. Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"What! Rickeybockey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (attempting the pure Italian accentuation).&mdash;"Signor
      Riccabocca."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (slapping his cards on the table in despair).&mdash;"Are we playing
      at whist, or are we not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, who is fourth player, drops the king to Captain Higginbotham's
      lead of the ace of hearts. Now the captain has left queen, knave, and two
      other hearts, four trumps to the queen, and nothing to win a trick with in
      the two other suits. This hand is therefore precisely one of those in
      which, especially after the fall of that king of hearts in the adversary's
      hand, it becomes a matter of reasonable doubt whether to lead trumps or
      not. The captain hesitates, and not liking to play out his good hearts
      with the certainty of their being trumped by the squire, nor, on the other
      hand, liking to open the other suits, in which he has not a card that can
      assist his partner, resolves, as becomes a military man in such dilemma,
      to make a bold push and lead out trumps in the chance of finding his
      partner strong and so bringing in his long suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (taking advantage of the much meditating pause made by the
      captain).&mdash;"Mrs. Dale, it is not my fault. I have asked Rickeybockey,&mdash;time
      out of mind. But I suppose I am not fine enough for those foreign chaps.
      He'll not come,&mdash;that's all I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (aghast at seeing the captain play out trumps, of which he, Mr.
      Dale, has only two, wherewith he expects to ruff the suit of spades, of
      which he has only one, the cards all falling in suits, while he has not a
      single other chance of a trick in his hand).&mdash;"Really, Squire, we had
      better give up playing if you put out my partner in this extraordinary
      way,&mdash;jabber, jabber, jabber!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Well, we must be good children, Harry. What!&mdash;trumps,
      Barney? Thank ye for that!" And the squire might well be grateful, for the
      unfortunate adversary has led up to ace king knave, with two other trumps.
      Squire takes the parson's ten with his knave, and plays out ace king;
      then, having cleared all the trumps except the captain's queen and his own
      remaining two, leads off tierce major in that very suit of spades of which
      the parson has only one,&mdash;and the captain, indeed, but two,&mdash;forces
      out the captain's queen, and wins the game in a canter.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (with a look at the captain which might have become the awful brows
      of Jove, when about to thunder).&mdash;"That, I suppose, is the
      new-fashioned London play! In my time the rule was, 'First save the game,
      then try to win it.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN.&mdash;"Could not save it, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (exploding)&mdash;"Not save it!&mdash;two ruffs in my own hand,&mdash;two
      tricks certain till you took them out! Monstrous! The rashest trump."&mdash;Seizes
      the cards, spreads them on the table, lip quivering, hands trembling,
      tries to show how five tricks could have been gained,&mdash;N.B. It is
      short whist which Captain Barnabas had introduced at the Hall,&mdash;can't
      make out more than four; Captain smiles triumphantly; Parson in a passion,
      and not at all convinced, mixes all the cards together again, and falling
      back in his chair, groans, with tears in his voice.&mdash;"The cruellest
      trump! the most wanton cruelty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hazeldeans in chorus.&mdash;"Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha!" The captain, who
      does not laugh this time, and whose turn it is to deal, shuffles the cards
      for the conquering game of the rubber with as much caution and prolixity
      as Fabius might have employed in posting his men. The squire gets up to
      stretch his legs, and, the insinuation against his hospitality recurring
      to his thoughts, calls out to his wife, "Write to Rickeybockey to-morrow
      yourself, Harry, and ask him to come and spend two or three days here.
      There, Mrs. Dale, you hear me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mrs. Dale, putting her hands to her ears in implied rebuke at
      the loudness of the squire's tone. "My dear sir, do remember that I'm a
      sad nervous creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg pardon," muttered Mr. Hazeldean, turning to his son, who having got
      tired of the caricatures, had fished out for himself the great folio
      County History, which was the only book in the library that the squire
      much valued, and which he usually kept under lock and key, in his study,
      together with the field-books and steward's accounts, but which he had
      reluctantly taken into the drawing-room that day, in order to oblige
      Captain Higginbotham. For the Higginbothams&mdash;an old Saxon family, as
      the name evidently denotes&mdash;had once possessed lands in that very
      county; and the captain, during his visits to Hazeldean Hall, was
      regularly in the habit of asking to look into the County History, for the
      purpose of refreshing his eyes, and renovating his sense of ancestral
      dignity, with the following paragraph therein:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   To the left of the village of Dunder, and pleasantly situated in a
   hollow, lies Botham Hall, the residence of the ancient family of
   Higginbotham, as it is now commonly called. Yet it appears by the
   county rolls, and sundry old deeds, that the family formerly styled
   itself Higges, till the Manor House lying in Botham, they gradually
   assumed the appellation of Higges-in-Botham, and in process of time,
   yielding to the corruptions of the vulgar, Higginbotham."
</pre>
    <p>
      "What, Frank! my County History!" cried the squire. "Mrs. H., he has got
      my County History!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Hazeldean, it is time he should know something about the county."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and history too," said Mrs. Dale, malevolently, for the little temper
      was by no means blown over.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK.&mdash;"I'll not hurt it, I assure you, sir. But I'm very much
      interested just at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAPTAIN (putting down the cards to cut).&mdash;"You've got hold of
      that passage about Botham Hall, page 706, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK.&mdash;"No; I was trying to make out how far it is to Mr. Leslie's
      place, Rood Hall. Do you know, Mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"I can't say I do. The Leslies don't mix with the
      county; and Rood lies very much out of the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK.&mdash;"Why don't they mix with the county?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"I believe they are poor, and therefore I suppose
      they are proud; they are an old family."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (thrumming on the table with great impatience).&mdash;"Old
      fiddle-dee!&mdash;talking of old families when the cards have been
      shuffled this half-hour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN BARNABAS.&mdash;"Will you cut for your partner, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (who has been listening to Frank's inquiries with a musing air).&mdash;"Why
      do you want to know the distance to Rood Hall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (rather hesitatingly).&mdash;"Because Randal Leslie is there for the
      holidays, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Your wife has cut for you, Mr. Hazeldean. I don't think it
      was quite fair; and my partner has turned up a deuce,&mdash;deuce of
      hearts. Please to come and play, if you mean to play."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire returns to the table, and in a few minutes the game is decided
      by a dexterous finesse of the captain against the Hazeldeans. The clock
      strikes ten; the servants enter with a tray; the squire counts up his own
      and his wife's losings; and the captain and parson divide sixteen
      shillings between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"There, Parson, I hope you'll be in a better humour. You win
      enough out of us to set up a coach-and-four."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut!" muttered the parson; "at the end of the year, I'm not a penny the
      richer for it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, monstrous as that assertion seemed, it was perfectly true,
      for the parson portioned out his gains into three divisions. One-third he
      gave to Mrs. Dale, for her own special pocket-money; what became of the
      second third he never owned even to his better half,&mdash;but certain it
      was, that every time the parson won seven-and-sixpence, half-a-crown,
      which nobody could account for, found its way to the poor-box; while the
      remaining third, the parson, it is true, openly and avowedly retained; but
      I have no manner of doubt that, at the year's end, it got to the poor
      quite as safely as if it had been put into the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party had now gathered round the tray, and were helping themselves to
      wine and water, or wine without water,&mdash;except Frank, who still
      remained poring over the map in the County History, with his head leaning
      on his hands, and his fingers plunged in his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank," said Mrs. Hazeldean, "I never saw you so studious before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank started up and coloured, as if ashamed of being accused of too much
      study in anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (with a little embarrassment in his voice).&mdash;"Pray, Frank,
      what do you know of Randal Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir, he is at Eton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of a boy is he?" asked Mrs. Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank hesitated, as if reflecting, and then answered, "They say he is the
      cleverest boy in the school. But then he saps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In other words," said Mr. Dale, with proper parsonic gravity, "he
      understands that he was sent to school to learn his lessons, and he learns
      them. You call that sapping? call it doing his duty. But pray, who and
      what is this Randal Leslie, that you look so discomposed, Squire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who and what is he?" repeated the squire, in a low growl. "Why, you know
      Mr. Audley Egerton married Miss Leslie, the great heiress; and this boy is
      a relation of hers. I may say," added the squire, "that he is a near
      relation of mine, for his grandmother was a Hazeldean; but all I know
      about the Leslies is, that Mr. Egerton, as I am told, having no children
      of his own, took up young Randal (when his wife died, poor woman), pays
      for his schooling, and has, I suppose, adopted the boy as his heir. Quite
      welcome. Frank and I want nothing from Mr. Audley Egerton, thank Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can well believe in your brother's generosity to his wife's kindred,"
      said the parson, sturdily, "for I am sure Mr. Egerton is a man of strong
      feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce do you know about Mr. Egerton? I don't suppose you could
      ever have even spoken to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the parson, colouring up, and looking confused. "I had some
      conversation with him once;" and observing the squire's surprise, he added&mdash;"when
      I was curate at Lansmere, and about a painful business connected with the
      family of one of my parishioners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, one of your parishioners at Lansmere,&mdash;one of the constituents
      Mr. Audley Egerton threw over, after all the pains I had taken to get him
      his seat. Rather odd you should never have mentioned this before, Mr.
      Dale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir," said the parson, sinking his voice, and in a mild tone of
      conciliatory expostulation, "you are so irritable whenever Mr. Egerton's
      name is mentioned at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Irritable!" exclaimed the squire, whose wrath had been long simmering,
      and now fairly boiled over,&mdash;"irritable, sir! I should think so: a
      man for whom I stood godfather at the hustings, Mr. Dale! a man for whose
      sake I was called a 'prize ox,' Mr. Dale! a man for whom I was hissed in a
      market-place, Mr. Dale! a man for whom I was shot at, in cold blood, by an
      officer in His Majesty's service, who lodged a ball in my right shoulder,
      Mr. Dale! a man who had the ingratitude, after all this, to turn his back
      on the landed interest,&mdash;to deny that there was any agricultural
      distress in a year which broke three of the best farmers I ever had, Mr.
      Dale!&mdash;a man, sir, who made a speech on the Currency which was
      complimented by Ricardo, a Jew! Good heavens! a pretty parson you are, to
      stand up for a fellow complimented by a Jew! Nice ideas you must have of
      Christianity! Irritable, sir!" now fairly roared the squire, adding to the
      thunder of his voice the cloud of a brow, which evinced a menacing
      ferocity that might have done honour to Bussy d'Amboise or Fighting
      Fitzgerald. "Sir, if that man had not been my own half-brother, I'd have
      called him out. I have stood my ground before now. I have had a ball in my
      right shoulder. Sir, I'd have called him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hazeldean! Mr. Hazeldean! I'm shocked at you," cried the parson; and,
      putting his lips close to the squire's ear, he went on in a whisper, "What
      an example to your son! You'll have him fighting duels one of these days,
      and nobody to blame but yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      This warning cooled Mr. Hazeldean; and muttering, "Why the deuce did you
      set me off?" he fell back into his chair, and began to fan himself with
      his pocket-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson skilfully and remorselessly pursued the advantage he had
      gained. "And now that you may have it in your power to show civility and
      kindness to a boy whom Mr. Egerton has taken up, out of respect to his
      wife's memory,&mdash;a kinsman, you say, of your own, and who has never
      offended you,&mdash;a boy whose diligence in his studies proves him to be
      an excellent companion to your son-Frank" (here the parson raised his
      voice), "I suppose you would like to call on young Leslie, as you were
      studying the county map so attentively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," answered Frank, rather timidly, "if my father does not object
      to it. Leslie has been very kind tome, though he is in the sixth form,
      and, indeed, almost the head of the school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Mrs. Hazeldean, "one studious boy has a fellow feeling for
      another; and though you enjoy your holidays, Frank, I am sure you read
      hard at school."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dale opened her eyes very wide, and stared in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hazeldean retorted that look, with great animation. "Yes, Carry,"
      said she, tossing her head, "though you may not think Frank clever, his
      masters find him so. He got a prize last half. That beautiful book, Frank&mdash;hold
      up your head, my love&mdash;what did you get it for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (reluctantly).&mdash;"Verses, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN (with triumph).&mdash;"Verses!&mdash;there, Carry, verses!"
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (in a hurried tone).&mdash;"Yes, but Leslie wrote them for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN (recoiling).&mdash;"O Frank! a prize for what another did
      for you&mdash;that was mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (ingenuously).&mdash;"You can't be more ashamed, Mother, than I was
      when they gave me the prize."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (though previously provoked at being snubbed by Harry, now
      showing the triumph of generosity over temper).&mdash;"I beg your pardon,
      Frank. Your mother must be as proud of that shame as she was of the
      prize."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hazeldean puts her arm round Frank's neck, smiles beamingly on Mrs.
      Dale, and converses with her son in a low tone about Randal Leslie. Miss
      Jemima now approached Carry, and said in an "aside," "But we are
      forgetting poor Mr. Riccabocca. Mrs. Hazeldean, though the dearest
      creature in the world, has such a blunt way of inviting people&mdash;don't
      you think if you were to say a word to him, Carry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (kindly, as she wraps her shawl round her).&mdash;"Suppose you
      write the note yourself? Meanwhile I shall see him, no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (putting his hand on the squire's shoulder).&mdash;"You forgive my
      impertinence, my kind friend. We parsons, you know, are apt to take
      strange liberties, when we honour and love folks as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fish," said the squire; but his hearty smile came to his lips in spite of
      himself. "You always get your own way, and I suppose Frank must ride over
      and see this pet of my&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother's," quoth the parson, concluding the sentence in a tone which
      gave to the sweet word so sweet a sound that the squire would not correct
      the parson, as he had been about to correct himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale moved on; but as he passed Captain Barnabas, the benignant
      character of his countenance changed sadly. "The cruellest trump, Captain
      Higginbotham!" said he sternly, and stalked by-majestic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was so fine that the parson and his wife, as they walked home,
      made a little detour through the shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"I think I have done a good piece of work to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (rousing himself from a revery).&mdash;"Have you, Carry?&mdash;it
      will be a very pretty handkerchief."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"Handkerchief?&mdash;nonsense, dear. Don't you think it
      would be a very happy thing for both if Jemima and Signor Riccabocca could
      be brought together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Brought together!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"You do snap up one so, my dear; I mean if I could make a
      match of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"I think Riccabocca is a match already, not only for Jemima,
      but yourself into the bargain."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (smiling loftily).&mdash;"Well, we shall see. Was not Jemima's
      fortune about L4000?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (dreamily, for he is relapsing fast into his interrupted revery).&mdash;"Ay&mdash;ay&mdash;I
      dare say."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"And she must have saved! I dare say it is nearly L6000
      by this time; eh! Charles dear, you really are so&mdash;good gracious,
      what's that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Dale made this exclamation, they had just emerged from the
      shrubbery into the village green.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"What's what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (pinching her husband's arm very nippingly). "That thing&mdash;there&mdash;there."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Only the new stocks, Carry; I don't wonder they frighten
      you, for you are a very sensible woman. I only wish they would frighten
      the squire."

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [Supposed to be a letter from Mrs. Hazeldean to A. Riccabocca, Esq.,
   The Casino; but, edited, and indeed composed, by Miss Jemima
   Hazeldean.]
HAZELDEAN HALL.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR SIR,&mdash;To a feeling heart it must always be painful to give pain
      to another, and (though I am sure unconsciously) you have given the
      greatest pain to poor Mr. Hazeldean and myself, indeed to all our little
      circle, in so cruelly refusing our attempts to become better acquainted
      with a gentleman we so highly ESTEEM. Do, pray, dear sir, make us the
      amende honorable, and give us the pleasure of your company for a few days
      at the Hall. May we expect you Saturday next?&mdash;our dinner hour is six
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the best compliments of Mr. and Miss Jemima Hazeldean, believe me, my
      dear sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly, H. H.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jemima having carefully sealed this note, which Mrs. Hazeldean had
      very willingly deputed her to write, took it herself into the stable-yard,
      in order to give the groom proper instructions to wait for an answer. But
      while she was speaking to the man, Frank, equipped for riding, with more
      than his usual dandyism, came into the yard, calling for his pony in a
      loud voice; and singling out the very groom whom Miss Jemima was
      addressing&mdash;for, indeed, he was the smartest of all in the squire's
      stables&mdash;told him to saddle the gray pad and accompany the pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Frank," said Miss Jemima, "you can't have George; your father wants
      him to go on a message,&mdash;you can take Mat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mat, indeed!" said Frank, grumbling with some reason; for Mat was a surly
      old fellow, who tied a most indefensible neckcloth, and always contrived
      to have a great patch on his boots,&mdash;besides, he called Frank
      "Master," and obstinately refused to trot down hill,&mdash;"Mat, indeed!
      let Mat take the message, and George go with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Jemima had also her reasons for rejecting Mat. Mat's foible was
      not servility, and he always showed true English independence in all
      houses where he was not invited to take his ale in the servants' hall. Mat
      might offend Signor Riccabocca, and spoil all. An animated altercation
      ensued, in the midst of which the squire and his wife entered the yard,
      with the intention of driving in the conjugal gig to the market town. The
      matter was referred to the natural umpire by both the contending parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire looked with great contempt on his son. "And what do you want a
      groom at all for? Are you afraid of tumbling off the pony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK.&mdash;"No, Sir; but I like to go as a gentleman, when I pay a visit
      to a gentleman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (in high wrath).&mdash;"You precious puppy! I think I'm as good a
      gentleman as you any day, and I should like to know when you ever saw me
      ride to call on a neighbour with a fellow jingling at my heels, like that
      upstart Ned Spankie, whose father kept a cotton mill. First time I ever
      heard of a Hazeldean thinking a livery coat was necessary to prove his
      gentility!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN (observing Frank colouring, and about to reply).&mdash;"Hush,
      Frank, never answer your father,&mdash;and you are going to call on Mr.
      Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am, and I am very much obliged to my father for letting me," said
      Frank, taking the squire's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but, Frank," continued Mrs. Hazeldean, "I think you heard that the
      Leslies were very poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK.&mdash;"Eh, Mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"And would you run the chance of wounding the pride
      of a gentleman as well born as yourself by affecting any show of being
      richer than he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (with great admiration).&mdash;"Harry, I'd give L10 to have said
      that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (leaving the squire's hand to take his mother's).&mdash;"You're
      quite right, Mother; nothing could be more snobbish!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE. "Give us your fist, too, sir; you'll be a chip of the old block,
      after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank smiled, and walked off to his pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN (to Miss Jemima).&mdash;"Is that the note you were to write
      for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA.&mdash;"Yes; I supposed you did not care about seeing it, so I
      have sealed it, and given it to George."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"But Frank will pass close by the Casino on his way
      to the Leslies'. It may be more civil if he leaves the note himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS JEMIMA (hesitatingly).&mdash;"Do you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"Yes, certainly. Frank, Frank, as you pass by the
      Casino, call on Mr. Riccabocca, give this note, and say we shall be
      heartily glad if he will come." Frank nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop a bit," cried the squire. "If Rickeybockey is at home, 't is ten to
      one if he don't ask you to take a glass of wine! If he does, mind, 't is
      worse than asking you to take a turn on the rack. Faugh! you remember,
      Harry?&mdash;I thought it was all up with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," cried Mrs. Hazeldean; "for Heaven's sake not a drop. Wine, indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk of it," cried the squire, making a wry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take care, Sir!" said Frank, laughing as he disappeared within the
      stable, followed by Miss Jemima, who now coaxingly makes it up with him,
      and does not leave off her admonitions to be extremely polite to the poor
      foreign gentleman till Frank gets his foot into the stirrup, and the pony,
      who knows whom he has got to deal with, gives a preparatory plunge or two,
      and then darts out of the yard.

    <h3>
      INFORMING THE READER HOW THIS WORK CAME TO HAVE INITIAL CHAPTERS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "There can't be a doubt," said my father, "that to each of the main
      divisions of your work&mdash;whether you call them Books or Parts&mdash;you
      should prefix an Initial or Introductory Chapter."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Can't be a doubt, sir? Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Fielding lays it down as an indispensable rule, which
      he supports by his example; and Fielding was an artistical writer, and
      knew what he was about."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Do you remember any of his reasons, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Why, indeed, Fielding says, very justly, that he is not
      bound to assign any reason; but he does assign a good many, here and
      there,&mdash;to find which I refer you to 'Tom Jones.' I will only
      observe, that one of his reasons, which is unanswerable, runs to the
      effect that thus, in every Part or Book, the reader has the advantage of
      beginning at the fourth or fifth page instead of the first,&mdash;'a
      matter by no means of trivial consequence,' saith Fielding, 'to persons
      who read books with no other view than to say they have read them,&mdash;a
      more general motive to reading than is commonly imagined; and from which
      not only law books and good books, but the pages of Homer and Virgil,
      Swift and Cervantes, have been often turned Over.' There," cried my
      father, triumphantly, "I will lay a shilling to twopence that I have
      quoted the very words."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CANTON.&mdash;"Dear me, that only means skipping; I don't see any
      great advantage in writing a chapter, merely for people to skip it."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Neither do I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CANTON (dogmatically).&mdash;"It is the repose in the picture,&mdash;Fielding
      calls it 'contrast.'&mdash;(Still more dogmatically.)&mdash;I say there
      can't be a doubt about it. Besides" added my father after a pause,&mdash;"besides,
      this usage gives you opportunities to explain what has gone before, or to
      prepare for what's coming; or, since Fielding contends, with great truth,
      that some learning is necessary for this kind of historical composition,
      it allows you, naturally and easily, the introduction of light and
      pleasant ornaments of that nature. At each flight in the terrace you may
      give the eye the relief of an urn or a statue. Moreover, when so inclined,
      you create proper pausing-places for reflection; and complete by a
      separate, yet harmonious ethical department, the design of a work, which
      is but a mere Mother Goose's tale if it does not embrace a general view of
      the thoughts and actions of mankind."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"But then, in these initial chapters, the author
      thrusts himself forward; and just when you want to get on with the
      dramatis personae, you find yourself face to face with the poet himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CANTON.&mdash;"Pooh! you can contrive to prevent that! Imitate the
      chorus of the Greek stage, who fill up the intervals between the action by
      saying what the author would otherwise say in his own person."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (slyly).&mdash;"That's a good idea, sir,&mdash;and I have a
      chorus, and a choregus too, already in my eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CANTON (unsuspectingly).&mdash;"Aha! you are not so dull a fellow as
      you would make yourself out to be; and, even if an author did thrust
      himself forward, what objection is there to that? It is a mere affectation
      to suppose that a book can come into the world without an author. Every
      child has a father,&mdash;one father at least,&mdash;as the great Conde
      says very well in his poem."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"The great Conde a poet! I never heard that before."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CANTON.&mdash;"I don't say he was a poet, but he sent a poem to Madame
      de Montansier. Envious critics think that he must have paid somebody else
      to write it; but there is no reason why a great captain should not write a
      poem,&mdash;I don't say a good poem, but a poem. I wonder, Roland, if the
      duke ever tried his hand at 'Stanzas to Mary,' or 'Lines to a Sleeping
      Babe.'"
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "It is a sweet pretty place," thought Frank, as he opened the gate which
      led across the fields to the Casino, that smiled down upon him with its
      plaster pilasters. "I wonder, though, that my father, who is so particular
      in general, suffers the carriage-road to be so full of holes and weeds.
      Mounseer does not receive many visits, I take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Frank got into the ground immediately before the house, he saw no
      cause of complaint as to want of order and repair. Nothing could be kept
      more neatly. Frank was ashamed of the dint made by the pony's hoofs on the
      smooth gravel: he dismounted, tied the animal to the wicket, and went on
      foot towards the glass door in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell once, twice, but nobody came, for the old woman-servant,
      who was hard of hearing, was far away in the yard, searching for any eggs
      which the hen might have scandalously hidden for culinary purposes; and
      Jackeymo was fishing for the sticklebacks and minnows which were, when
      caught, to assist the eggs, when found, in keeping together the bodies and
      souls of himself and his master. The old woman had been lately put upon
      board wages. Lucky old woman! Frank rang a third time, and with the
      impetuosity of his age. A face peeped from the belvidere on the terrace.
      "Diavolo!" said Dr. Riccabocca to himself. "Young cocks crow hard on their
      own dunghill; it must be a cock of a high race to crow so loud at
      another's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewith he shambled out of the summer-house, and appeared suddenly
      before Frank, in a very wizard-like dressing-robe of black serge, a red
      cap on his head, and a cloud of smoke coming rapidly from his lips, as a
      final consolatory whiff, before he removed the pipe from them. Frank had
      indeed seen the doctor before, but never in so scholastic a costume, and
      he was a little startled by the apparition at his elbow, as he turned
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signorino," said the Italian, taking off his cap with his usual urbanity,
      "pardon the negligence of my people; I am too happy to receive your
      commands in person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Rickeybockey?" stammered Frank, much confused by this polite address,
      and the low, yet stately, bow with which it was accompanied. "I&mdash;I
      have a note from the Hall. Mamma&mdash;that is, my mother&mdash;and aunt
      Jemima beg their best compliments, and hope you will come, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor took the note with another bow, and, opening the glass door,
      invited Frank to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman, with a schoolboy's usual bluntness, was about to say
      that he was in a hurry, and had rather not; but Dr. Riccabocca's grand
      manner awed him, while a glimpse of the hall excited his curiosity, so he
      silently obeyed the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall, which was of an octagon shape, had been originally panelled off
      into compartments, and in these the Italian had painted landscapes, rich
      with the warm sunny light of his native climate. Frank was no judge of the
      art displayed; but he was greatly struck with the scenes depicted: they
      were all views of some lake, real or imaginary; in all, dark-blue shining
      waters reflected dark-blue placid skies. In one, a flight of steps
      ascended to the lake, and a gay group was seen feasting on the margin; in
      another, sunset threw its rose-hues over a vast villa or palace, backed by
      Alpine hills, and flanked by long arcades of vines, while pleasure-boats
      skimmed over the waves below. In short, throughout all the eight
      compartments, the scene, though it differed in details, preserved the same
      general character, as if illustrating some favourite locality. The Italian
      did not, however, evince any desire to do the honours of his own art, but,
      preceding Frank across the hall, opened the door of his usual
      sitting-room, and requested him to enter. Frank did so rather reluctantly,
      and seated himself with unwonted bashfulness on the edge of a chair. But
      here new specimens of the doctor's handicraft soon riveted attention. The
      room had been originally papered, but Riccabocca had stretched canvas over
      the walls, and painted thereon sundry satirical devices, each separated
      from the other by scroll-works of fantastic arabesques. Here a Cupid was
      trundling a wheelbarrow full of hearts, which he appeared to be selling to
      an ugly old fellow, with a money-bag in his hand&mdash;probably Plutus.
      There Diogenes might be seen walking through a market-place, with his
      lantern in his hand, in search of an honest man, whilst the children
      jeered at him, and the curs snapped at his heels. In another place a lion
      was seen half dressed in a fox's hide, while a wolf in a sheep's mask was
      conversing very amicably with a young lamb. Here again might be seen the
      geese stretching out their necks from the Roman Capitol in full cackle,
      while the stout invaders were beheld in the distance, running off as hard
      as they could. In short, in all these quaint entablatures some pithy
      sarcasm was symbolically conveyed; only over the mantel piece was the
      design graver and more touching. It was the figure of a man in a pilgrim's
      garb, chained to the earth by small but innumerable ligaments, while a
      phantom likeness of himself, his shadow, was seen hastening down what
      seemed an interminable vista; and underneath were written the pathetic
      words of Horace&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             "Patriae quis exul
             Se quoque fugit?"

     ["What exile from his country can also fly from himself?"]
</pre>
    <p>
      The furniture of the room was extremely simple, and somewhat scanty; yet
      it was arranged so as to impart an air of taste and elegance to the room.
      Even a few plaster busts and statues, though bought but of some humble
      itinerant, had their classical effect, glistening from out stands of
      flowers that were grouped around them, or backed by graceful screen-works
      formed from twisted osiers, which, by the simple contrivance of trays at
      the bottom filled with earth, served for living parasitical plants, with
      gay flowers contrasting thick ivy leaves, and gave to the whole room the
      aspect of a bower. "May I ask your permission?" said the Italian, with his
      finger on the seal of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," said Frank, with naivete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca broke the seal, and a slight smile stole over his countenance.
      Then he turned a little aside from Frank, shaded his face with his hand,
      and seemed to muse. "Mrs. Hazeldean," said he, at last, "does me very
      great honour. I hardly recognize her handwriting, or I should have been
      more impatient to open the letter." The dark eyes were lifted over the
      spectacles and went right into Frank's unprotected and undiplomatic heart.
      The doctor raised the note, and pointed to the characters with his
      forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cousin Jemima's hand," said Frank, as directly as if the question had
      been put to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian smiled. "Mr. Hazeldean has company staying with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that is, only Barney,&mdash;the captain. There's seldom much company
      before the shooting season," added Frank, with a slight sigh; "and then,
      you know, the holidays are over. For my part, I think we ought to break up
      a month later."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor seemed reassured by the first sentence in Frank's reply, and,
      seating himself at the table, wrote his answer,&mdash;not hastily, as we
      English write, but with care and precision, like one accustomed to weigh
      the nature of words,&mdash;in that stiff Italian hand, which allows the
      writer so much time to think while he forms his letters. He did not,
      therefore, reply at once to Frank's remark about the holidays, but was
      silent till he had concluded his note, read it three times over, sealed it
      by the taper he slowly lighted, and then, giving it to Frank, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "For your sake, young gentleman, I regret that your holidays are so early;
      for mine, I must rejoice, since I accept the kind invitation you have
      rendered doubly gratifying by bringing it yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deuce take the fellow and his fine speeches! One don't know which way to
      look," thought English Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian smiled again, as if this time he had read the boy's heart,
      without need of those piercing black eyes, and said, less ceremoniously
      than before, "You don't care much for compliments, young gentleman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't indeed," said Frank, heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better for you, since your way in the world is made: it would
      be so much the worse if you had to make it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank looked puzzled: the thought was too deep for him, so he turned to
      the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those are very funny," said he; "they seem capitally done. Who did 'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signoriuo Hazeldean, you are giving me what you refused yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" said Frank, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compliments!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;I&mdash;no; but they are well done: are n't they, sir?"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not particularly: you speak to the artist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you painted them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the pictures in the hall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taken from nature, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nature," said the Italian, sententiously, perhaps evasively, "lets
      nothing be taken from her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Frank, puzzled again. "Well, I must wish you good morning, sir;
      I am very glad you are coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without compliment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without compliment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A rivedersi&mdash;good-by for the present, my young signorino. This way,"
      observing Frank make a bolt towards the wrong door. "Can I offer you a
      glass of wine?&mdash;it is pure, of our own making."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, indeed, sir," cried Frank, suddenly recollecting his
      father's admonition. "Good-by, don't trouble yourself, sir; I know any way
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the bland Italian followed his guest to the wicket, where Frank had
      left the pony. The young gentleman, afraid lest so courteous a host should
      hold the stirrup for him, twitched off the bridle, and mounted in haste,
      not even staying to ask if the Italian could put him in the way to Rood
      Hall, of which way he was profoundly ignorant. The Italian's eye followed
      the boy as he rode up the ascent in the lane, and the doctor sighed
      heavily. "The wiser we grow," said he to himself, "the more we regret the
      age of our follies: it is better to gallop with a light heart up the stony
      hill than sit in the summer-house and cry 'How true!' to the stony truths
      of Machiavelli!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he turned back into the belvidere; but he could not resume his
      studies. He remained some minutes gazing on the prospect, till the
      prospect reminded him of the fields which Jackeymo was bent on his hiring,
      and the fields reminded him of Lenny Fairfield. He returned to the house,
      and in a few moments re-emerged in his out-of-door trim, with cloak and
      umbrella, re-lighted his pipe, and strolled towards Hazeldean village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Frank, after cantering on for some distance, stopped at a
      cottage, and there learned that there was a short cut across the fields to
      Rood Hall, by which he could save nearly three miles. Frank, however,
      missed the short cut, and came out into the high road; a turnpike-keeper,
      after first taking his toll, put him back again into the short cut; and
      finally, he got into some green lanes, where a dilapidated finger-post
      directed him to Rood. Late at noon, having ridden fifteen miles in the
      desire to reduce ten to seven, he came suddenly upon a wild and primitive
      piece of ground, that seemed half chase, half common, with crazy
      tumbledown cottages of villanous aspect scattered about in odd nooks and
      corners. Idle, dirty children were making mud-pies on the road;
      slovenly-looking women were plaiting straw at the threshold; a large but
      forlorn and decayed church, that seemed to say that the generation which
      saw it built was more pious than the generation which now resorted to it,
      stood boldly and nakedly out by the roadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this the village of Rood?" asked Frank of a stout young man breaking
      stones on the road&mdash;sad sign that no better labour could be found for
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      The man sullenly nodded, and continued his work. "And where's the Hall&mdash;Mr.
      Leslie's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up in stolid surprise, and this time touched his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be you going there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if I can find out where it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll show your honour," said the boor, alertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank reined in the pony, and the man walked by his side. Frank was much
      of his father's son, despite the difference of age, and that more
      fastidious change of manner which characterizes each succeeding race in
      the progress of civilization. Despite all his Eton finery, he was familiar
      with peasants, and had the quick eye of one country-born as to country
      matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't seem very well off in this village, my man?" said he,
      knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noa; there be a deal of distress here in the winter time, and summer too,
      for that matter; and the parish ben't much help to a single man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely the farmers want work here as well as elsewhere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Deed, and there ben't much farming work here,&mdash;most o' the parish
      be all wild ground loike."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor have a right of common, I suppose," said Frank, surveying a
      large assortment of vagabond birds and quadrupeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; neighbour Timmins keeps his geese on the common, and some has a cow,
      and them be neighbour Jowlas's pigs. I don't know if there's a right,
      loike; but the folks at the Hall does all they can to help us, and that
      ben't much: they ben't as rich as some folks; but," added the peasant,
      proudly, "they be as good blood as any in the shire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm glad to see you like them, at all events."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I likes them well eno'; mayhap you are at school with the young
      gentleman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I heard the clergyman say as how Master Randal was a mighty clever
      lad, and would get rich some day. I 'se sure I wish he would, for a poor
      squire makes a poor parish. There's the Hall, sir."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frank looked right ahead, and saw a square house that, in spite of modern
      sash windows, was evidently of remote antiquity. A high conical roof; a
      stack of tall quaint chimney-pots of red-baked clay (like those at Sutton
      Place in Surrey) dominating over isolated vulgar smoke-conductors, of the
      ignoble fashion of present times; a dilapidated groin-work, encasing
      within a Tudor arch a door of the comfortable date of George III., and the
      peculiarly dingy and weather-stained appearance of the small
      finely-finished bricks, of which the habitation was built,&mdash;all
      showed the abode of former generations adapted with tasteless irreverence
      to the habits of descendants unenlightened by Pugin, or indifferent to the
      poetry of the past. The house had emerged suddenly upon Frank out of the
      gloomy waste land, for it was placed in a hollow, and sheltered from sight
      by a disorderly group of ragged, dismal, valetudinarian fir-trees, until
      an abrupt turn of the road cleared that screen, and left the desolate
      abode bare to the discontented eye. Frank dismounted; the man held his
      pony; and after smoothing his cravat, the smart Etonian sauntered up to
      the door, and startled the solitude of the place with a loud peal from the
      modern brass knocker,&mdash;a knock which instantly brought forth an
      astonished starling who had built under the eaves of the gable roof, and
      called up a cloud of sparrows, tomtits, and yellow-hammers, who had been
      regaling themselves amongst the litter of a slovenly farmyard that lay in
      full sight to the right of the house, fenced off by a primitive paintless
      wooden rail. In process of time a sow, accompanied by a thriving and
      inquisitive family, strolled up to the gate of the fence, and, leaning her
      nose on the lower bar of the gate, contemplated the visitor with much
      curiosity and some suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Frank is still without, impatiently swingeing his white trousers
      with his whip, we will steal a hurried glance towards the respective
      members of the family within. Mr. Leslie, the paterfamilias, is in a
      little room called his "study," to which he regularly retires every
      morning after breakfast, rarely reappearing till one o'clock, which is his
      unfashionable hour for dinner. In what mysterious occupations Mr. Leslie
      passes those hours no one ever formed a conjecture. At the present moment
      he is seated before a little rickety bureau, one leg of which being
      shorter than the other is propped up by sundry old letters and scraps of
      newspapers; and the bureau is open, and reveals a great number of
      pigeonholes and divisions, filled with various odds and ends, the
      collection of many years. In some of these compartments are bundles of
      letters, very yellow, and tied in packets with faded tape; in another, all
      by itself, is a fragment of plum-pudding stone, which Mr. Leslie has
      picked up in his walks, and considered a rare mineral. It is neatly
      labelled, "Found in Hollow Lane, May 21st, 1804, by Maunder Slugge Leslie,
      Esq." The next division holds several bits of iron in the shape of nails,
      fragments of horse-shoes, etc., which Mr. Leslie has also met with in his
      rambles, and, according to a harmless popular superstition, deemed it
      highly unlucky not to pick up, and, once picked up, no less unlucky to
      throw away. Item, in the adjoining pigeon-hole, a goodly collection of
      pebbles with holes in them, preserved for the same reason, in company with
      a crooked sixpence; item, neatly arranged in fanciful mosaics, several
      periwinkles, Blackamoor's teeth (I mean the shell so called), and other
      specimens of the conchiferous ingenuity of Nature, partly inherited from
      some ancestral spinster, partly amassed by Mr. Leslie himself in a
      youthful excursion to the seaside. There were the farm-bailiff's accounts,
      several files of bills, an old stirrup, three sets of knee and shoe
      buckles which had belonged to Mr. Leslie's father, a few seals tied
      together by a shoe-string, a shagreen toothpick case, a tortoise shell
      magnifying-glass to read with, his eldest son's first copybooks, his
      second son's ditto, his daughter's ditto, and a lock of his wife's hair
      arranged in a true lover's knot, framed and glazed. There were also a
      small mousetrap; a patent corkscrew too good to be used in common;
      fragments of a silver teaspoon, that had, by natural decay, arrived at a
      dissolution of its parts; a small brown holland bag, containing halfpence
      of various dates, as far back as Queen Anne, accompanied by two French
      sous and a German silber gros,&mdash;the which miscellany Mr. Leslie
      magniloquently called "his coins," and had left in his will as a family
      heirloom. There were many other curiosities of congenial nature and equal
      value&mdash;quae nunc describere longum est. Mr. Leslie was engaged at
      this time in what is termed "putting things to rights,"&mdash;an
      occupation he performed with exemplary care once a week. This was his day;
      and he had just counted his coins, and was slowly tying them up again in
      the brown holland bag, when Frank's knock reached his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Maunder Slugge Leslie paused, shook his head as if incredulously, and
      was about to resume his occupation, when he was seized with a fit of
      yawning which prevented the bag being tied for full two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      While such the employment of the study, let us turn to the recreations in
      the drawing-room, or rather parlour. A drawing-room there was on the first
      floor, with a charming look-out, not on the dreary fir-trees, but on the
      romantic undulating forest-land; but the drawing-room had not been used
      since the death of the last Mrs. Leslie. It was deemed too good to sit in,
      except when there was company: there never being company, it was never sat
      in. Indeed, now the paper was falling off the walls with the damp, and the
      rats, mice, and moths&mdash;those "edaces rerum"&mdash;had eaten, between
      them, most of the chair-bottoms and a considerable part of the floor.
      Therefore, the parlour was the sole general sitting-room; and being
      breakfasted in, dined, and supped in, and, after supper, smoked in by Mr.
      Leslie to the accompaniment of rum-and-water, it is impossible to deny
      that it had what is called "a smell,"&mdash;a comfortable, wholesome
      family smell, speaking of numbers, meals, and miscellaneous social
      habitation. There were two windows: one looked full on the fir-trees; the
      other on the farmyard, with the pigsty closing the view. Near the fir-tree
      window sat Mrs. Leslie; before her, on a high stool, was a basket of the
      children's clothes that wanted mending. A work-table of rosewood inlaid
      with brass, which had been a wedding-present, and was a costly thing
      originally, but in that peculiar taste which is vulgarly called
      "Brummagem," stood at hand: the brass had started in several places, and
      occasionally made great havoc in the children's fingers and in Mrs.
      Leslie's gown; in fact it was the liveliest piece of furniture in the
      house, thanks to the petulant brasswork, and could not have been more
      mischievous if it had been a monkey. Upon the work-table lay a housewife
      and thimble, and scissors, and skeins of worsted and thread, and little
      scraps of linen and cloth for patches. But Mrs. Leslie was not actually
      working,&mdash;she was preparing to work; she had been preparing to work
      for the last hour and a half. Upon her lap she supported a novel, by a
      lady who wrote much for a former generation, under the name of "Mrs.
      Bridget Blue Mantle." She had a small needle in her left hand, and a very
      thick piece of thread in her right; occasionally she applied the end of
      the said thread to her lips, and then&mdash;her eyes fixed on the novel&mdash;made
      a blind, vacillating attack at the eye of the needle. But a camel would
      have gone through it with quite as much ease. Nor did the novel alone
      engage Mrs. Leslie's attention, for ever and anon she interrupted herself
      to scold the children, to inquire "what o'clock it was;" to observe that
      "Sarah would never suit;" and to wonder "why Mr. Leslie would not see that
      the work-table was mended." Mrs. Leslie has been rather a pretty woman. In
      spite of a dress at once slatternly and economical, she has still the air
      of a lady,&mdash;rather too much so, the hard duties of her situation
      considered. She is proud of the antiquity of her family on both sides; her
      mother was of the venerable stock of the Daudlers of Daudle Place, a race
      that existed before the Conquest. Indeed, one has only to read our
      earliest chronicles, and to glance over some of those long-winded
      moralizing poems which delighted the thanes and ealdermen of old, in order
      to see that the Daudles must have been a very influential family before
      William the First turned the country topsy-turvy. While the mother's race
      was thus indubitably Saxon, the father's had not only the name but the
      peculiar idiosyncrasy of the Normans, and went far to establish that
      crotchet of the brilliant author of "Sybil; or, The Two Nations," as to
      the continued distinction between the conquering and conquered
      populations. Mrs. Leslie's father boasted the name of Montfichet,&mdash;doubtless
      of the same kith and kin as those great barons of Alontfichet, who once
      owned such broad lands and such turbulent castles. A high-nosed, thin,
      nervous, excitable progeny, those same Montfydgets, as the most
      troublesome Norman could pretend to be. This fusion of race was notable to
      the most ordinary physiognomist in the physique and in the morale of Mrs.
      Leslie. She had the speculative blue eye of the Saxon, and the passionate
      high nose of the Norman; she had the musing do-nothingness of the
      Daudlers, and the reckless have-at-every-thingness of the Montfydgets. At
      Mrs. Leslie's feet, a little girl with her hair about her ears (and
      beautiful hair it was too) was amusing herself with a broken-nosed doll.
      At the far end of the room, before a high desk, sat Frank's Eton
      schoolfellow, the eldest son. A minute or two before Frank's alarum had
      disturbed the tranquillity of the household, he had raised his eyes from
      the books on the desk to glance at a very tattered copy of the Greek
      Testament, in which his brother Oliver had found a difficulty that he came
      to Randal to solve. As the young Etonian's face was turned to the light,
      your first impression on seeing it would have been melancholy, but
      respectful, interest,&mdash;for the face had already lost the joyous
      character of youth; there was a wrinkle between the brows; and the lines
      that speak of fatigue were already visible under the eyes and about the
      mouth; the complexion was sallow, the lips were pale. Years of study had
      already sown in the delicate organization the seeds of many an infirmity
      and many a pain; but if your look had rested longer on that countenance,
      gradually your compassion might have given place to some feeling uneasy
      and sinister,&mdash;a feeling akin to fear. There was in the whole
      expression so much of cold calm force, that it belied the debility of the
      frame. You saw there the evidence of a mind that was cultivated, and you
      felt that in that cultivation there was something formidable. A notable
      contrast to this countenance, prematurely worn and eminently intelligent,
      was the round healthy face of Oliver, with slow blue eyes fixed hard on
      the penetrating orbs of his brother, as if trying with might and main to
      catch from them a gleam of that knowledge with which they shone clear and
      frigid as a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Frank's knock, Oliver's slow blue eyes sparkled into animation, and he
      sprang from his brother's side. The little girl flung back the hair from
      her face, and stared at her mother with a look which spoke wonder and
      fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young student knit his brows, and then turned wearily back to the
      books on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me," cried Mrs. Leslie, "who can that possibly be? Oliver, come from
      the window, sir, this instant: you will be seen! Juliet, run, ring the
      bell; no, go to the head of the kitchen stairs, and call out to Jenny 'Not
      at home.' Not at home, on any account," repeated Mrs. Leslie, nervously,
      for the Montfydget blood was now in full flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute or so, Frank's loud boyish voice was distinctly heard at
      the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal slightly started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank Hazeldean's voice," said he; "I should like to see him, Mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See him," repeated Mrs. Leslie, in amaze; "see him! and the room in this
      state!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal might have replied that the room was in no worse state than usual;
      but he said nothing. A slight flush came and went over his pale face; and
      then he leaned his check on his hand, and compressed his lips firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outer door closed with a sullen, inhospitable jar, and a slip-shod
      female servant entered with a card between her finger and thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that for?&mdash;give it to me. Jenny," cried Mrs. Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jenny shook her head, laid the card on the desk beside Randal, and
      vanished without saying a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, look, Randal, look up," cried Oliver, who had again rushed to the
      window; "such a pretty gray pony!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal did look up; nay, he went deliberately to the window, and gazed a
      moment on the high-mettled pony and the well-dressed, spirited rider. In
      that moment changes passed over Randal's countenance more rapidly than
      clouds over the sky in a gusty day. Now envy and discontent, with the
      curled lip and the gloomy scowl; now hope and proud self-esteem, with the
      clearing brow and the lofty smile; and then again all became cold, firm,
      and close, as he walked back to his books, seated himself resolutely, and
      said, half aloud,&mdash;"Well, KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Leslie came up in fidget and in fuss; she leaned over Randal's
      shoulder and read the card. Written in pen and ink, with an attempt at
      imitation of printed Roman character, there appeared first "MR. FRANK
      HAZELDEAN;" but just over these letters, and scribbled hastily and less
      legibly in pencil, was,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR LESLIE,&mdash;Sorry you were out; come and see us,&mdash;do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will go, Randal?" said Mrs. Leslie, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you can go; you have clothes like a gentleman; you can go anywhere,
      not like those children;" and Mrs. Leslie glanced almost spitefully at
      poor Oliver's coarse threadbare jacket, and little Juliet's torn frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I have I owe at present to Mr. Egerton, and I should consult his
      wishes; he is not on good terms with these Hazeldeans." Then turning
      towards his brother, who looked mortified, he added, with a strange sort
      of haughty kindness, "What I may have hereafter, Oliver, I shall owe to
      myself; and then if I rise, I will raise my family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Randal," said Mrs. Leslie, fondly kissing him on the forehead, "what
      a good heart you have!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mother; my books don't tell me that it is a good heart that gets on
      in the world: it is a hard head," replied Randal, with a rude and scornful
      candour. "But I can read no more just now: come out, Oliver."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he slid from his mother's hand and left the room. When Oliver
      joined him, Randal was already on the common; and, without seeming to
      notice his brother, he continued to walk quickly, and with long strides,
      in profound silence. At length he paused under the shade of an old oak,
      that, too old to be of value save for firewood, had escaped the axe. The
      tree stood on a knoll, and the spot commanded a view of the decayed house,
      the dilapidated church, the dreary village.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oliver," said Randal, between his teeth, so that his voice had the sound
      of a hiss, "it was under this tree that I first resolved to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Randal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read hard: knowledge is power!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are so fond of reading."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" cried Randal. "Do you think, when Wolsey and Thomas-a-Becket became
      priests, they were fond of telling their beads and pattering Aves? I fond
      of reading!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver stared; the historical allusions were beyond his comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," continued Randal, "that we Leslies were not always the
      beggarly poor gentlemen we are now. You know that there is a man who lives
      in Grosvenor Square, and is very rich,&mdash;very. His riches come to him
      from a Leslie; that man is my patron, Oliver, and he&mdash;is very good to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's smile was withering as he spoke. "Come on," he said, after a
      pause,&mdash;"come on." Again the walk was quick, and the brothers were
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came at length to a little shallow brook, across which some large
      stones had been placed at short intervals, so that the boys walked over
      the ford dryshod. "Will you pull down that bough, Oliver?" said Randal,
      abruptly, pointing to a tree. Oliver obeyed mechanically; and Randal,
      stripping the leaves and snapping off the twigs, left a fork at the end;
      with this he began to remove the stepping-stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you about, Randal?" asked Oliver, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are on the other side of the brook now, and we shall not come back
      this way. We don't want the stepping-stones any more!&mdash;away with
      them!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning after this visit of Frank Hazeldean's to Rood Hall, the Right
      Honourable Audley Egerton, member of parliament, privy councillor, and
      minister of a high department in the State,&mdash;just below the rank of
      the cabinet,&mdash;was seated in his library, awaiting the delivery of the
      post, before he walked down to his office. In the mean while he sipped his
      tea, and glanced over the newspapers with that quick and half-disdainful
      eye with which your practical man in public life is wont to regard the
      abuse or the eulogium of the Fourth Estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is very little likeness between Mr. Egerton and his half-brother;
      none, indeed, except that they are both of tall stature, and strong,
      sinewy, English build. But even in this last they do not resemble each
      other; for the squire's athletic shape is already beginning to expand into
      that portly embonpoint which seems the natural development of contented
      men as they approach middle life. Audley, on the contrary, is inclined to
      be spare; and his figure, though the muscles are as firm as iron, has
      enough of the slender to satisfy metropolitan ideas of elegance. His
      dress, his look, his tout ensemble, are those of the London man. In the
      first, there is more attention to fashion than is usual amongst the busy
      members of the House of Commons; but then Audley Egerton has always been
      something more than a mere busy member of the House of Commons. He has
      always been a person of mark in the best society; and one secret of his
      success in life has been his high reputation as "a gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he now bends over the journals, there is an air of distinction in the
      turn of the well-shaped head, with the dark brown hair,&mdash;dark in
      spite of a reddish tinge,&mdash;cut close behind, and worn away a little
      towards the crown, so as to give an additional height to a commanding
      forehead. His profile is very handsome, and of that kind of beauty which
      imposes on men if it pleases women; and is, therefore, unlike that of your
      mere pretty fellows, a positive advantage in public life. It is a profile
      with large features clearly cut, masculine, and somewhat severe. The
      expression of his face is not open, like the squire's, nor has it the cold
      closeness which accompanies the intellectual character of young Leslie's;
      but it is reserved and dignified, and significant of self-control, as
      should be the physiognomy of a man accustomed to think before he speaks.
      When you look at him, you are not surprised to learn that he is not a
      florid orator nor a smart debater,&mdash;he is a "weighty speaker." He is
      fairly read, but without any great range either of ornamental scholarship
      or constitutional lore. He has not much humour; but he has that kind of
      wit which is essential to grave and serious irony. He has not much
      imagination, nor remarkable subtlety in reasoning; but if he does not
      dazzle he does not bore,&mdash;he is too much of the man of the world for
      that. He is considered to have sound sense and accurate judgment. Withal,
      as he now lays aside the journals, and his face relaxes its austerer
      lines, you will not be astonished to hear that he is a man who is said to
      have been greatly beloved by women, and still to exercise much influence
      in drawing-rooms and boudoirs. At least, no one was surprised when the
      great heiress, Clementina Leslie, kinswoman and ward to Lord Lansmere,&mdash;a
      young lady who had refused three earls and the heir apparent to a dukedom,&mdash;was
      declared by her dearest friends to be dying of love for Audley Egerton. It
      had been the natural wish of the Lansmeres that this lady should marry
      their son, Lord L'Estrange. But that young gentleman, whose opinions on
      matrimony partook of the eccentricity of his general character, could
      never be induced to propose, and had, according to the on-dits of town,
      been the principal party to make up the match between Clementina and his
      friend Audley; for the match required making-up, despite the predilections
      of the young heiress. Mr. Egerton had had scruples of delicacy. He avowed,
      for the first time, that his fortune was much less than had been generally
      supposed, and he did not like the idea of owing all to a wife, however
      highly be might esteem and admire her. Now, Lord L'Estrange (not long
      after the election at Lansmere, which had given to Audley his first seat
      in parliament) had suddenly exchanged from the battalion of the Guards to
      which he belonged, and which was detained at home, into a cavalry regiment
      on active service in the Peninsula. Nevertheless, even abroad, and amidst
      the distractions of war, his interest in all that could forward Egerton's
      career was unabated; and by letters to his father and to his cousin
      Clementina, he assisted in the negotiations for the marriage between Miss
      Leslie and his friend; and before the year in which Audley was returned
      for Lansmere had expired, the young senator received the hand of the great
      heiress. The settlement of her fortune, which was chiefly in the Funds,
      had been unusually advantageous to the husband; for though the capital was
      tied up so long as both survived, for the benefit of any children they
      might have, yet in the event of one of the parties dying without issue by
      the marriage, the whole passed without limitation to the survivor. Miss
      Leslie, in spite of all remonstrance from her own legal adviser, had
      settled this clause with Egerton's confidential solicitor, one Mr. Levy,
      of whom we shall see more hereafter; and Egerton was to be kept in
      ignorance of it till after the marriage. If in this Miss Leslie showed a
      generous trust in Mr. Egerton, she still inflicted no positive wrong on
      her relations, for she had none sufficiently near to her to warrant their
      claim to the succession. Her nearest kinsman, and therefore her natural
      heir, was Harley L'Estrange; and if he was contented, no one had a right
      to complain. The tie of blood between herself and the Leslies of Rood Hall
      was, as we shall see presently, extremely distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till after his marriage that Mr. Egerton took an active part in
      the business of the House of Commons. He was then at the most advantageous
      starting-point for the career of ambition. His words on the state of the
      country took importance from his stake in it. His talents found
      accessories in the opulence of Grosvenor Square, the dignity of a princely
      establishment, the respectability of one firmly settled in life, the
      reputation of a fortune in reality very large, and which was magnified by
      popular report into the revenues of a Croesus. Audley Egerton succeeded in
      parliament beyond the early expectations formed of him. He took, from the
      first, that station in the House which it requires tact to establish, and
      great knowledge of the world to free from the charge of impracticability
      and crotchet, but which, once established, is peculiarly imposing from the
      rarity of its independence; that is to say, the station of the moderate
      man who belongs sufficiently to a party to obtain its support, but is yet
      sufficiently disengaged from a party to make his vote and word, on certain
      questions, matter of anxiety and speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professing Toryism (the word Conservative, which would have suited him
      better, was not then known), he separated himself from the country party,
      and always avowed great respect for the opinions of the large towns. The
      epithet given to the views of Audley Egerton was "enlightened." Never too
      much in advance of the passion of the day, yet never behind its movement,
      he had that shrewd calculation of odds which a consummate mastery of the
      world sometimes bestows upon politicians,&mdash;perceived the chances for
      and against a certain question being carried within a certain time, and
      nicked the question between wind and water. He was so good a barometer of
      that changeful weather called Public Opinion, that he might have had a
      hand in the "Times" newspaper. He soon quarrelled, and purposely, with his
      Lansmere constituents; nor had he ever revisited that borough,&mdash;perhaps
      because it was associated with unpleasant reminiscences in the shape of
      the squire's epistolary trimmer, and in that of his own effigies which his
      agricultural constituents had burned in the corn-market. But the speeches
      that produced such indignation at Lansmere had delighted one of the
      greatest of our commercial towns, which at the next general election
      honoured him with its representation. In those days, before the Reform
      Bill, great commercial towns chose men of high mark for their member; and
      a proud station it was for him who was delegated to speak the voice of the
      princely merchants of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Egerton survived her marriage but a few years. She left no children;
      two had been born, but died in their first infancy. The property of the
      wife, therefore, passed without control or limit to the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been the grief of the widower, he disdained to betray
      it to the world. Indeed, Audley Egerton was a man who had early taught
      himself to conceal emotion. He buried himself in the country, none knew
      where, for some months. When he returned, there was a deep wrinkle on his
      brow,&mdash;but no change in his habits and avocations, except that,
      shortly afterwards, he accepted office, and thus became more busy than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Egerton had always been lavish and magnificent in money spatters. A
      rich man in public life has many claims on his fortune, and no one yielded
      to those claims with in air so regal as Audley Egerton. But amongst his
      many liberal actions, there was none which seemed more worthy of panegyric
      than the generous favour he extended to the son of his wife's poor and
      distant kinsfolk, the Leslies of Rood Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some four generations back, there had lived a certain Squire Leslie, a man
      of large acres and active mind. He had cause to be displeased with his
      elder son, and though he did not disinherit him, he left half his property
      to a younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger had capacity and spirit, which justified the parental
      provision. He increased his fortune; lifted himself into notice and
      consideration by public services and a noble alliance. His descendants
      followed his example, and took rank among the first commoners in England,
      till the last male, dying, left his sole heiress and representative in one
      daughter, Clementina, afterwards married to Mr. Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the elder son of the fore-mentioned squire had muddled and
      sotted away much of his share in the Leslie property; and, by low habits
      and mean society, lowered in repute his representation of the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      His successors imitated him, till nothing was left to Randal's father, Mr.
      Maunder Slugge Leslie, but the decayed house, which was what the Germans
      call the stamm schloss, or "stem hall," of the race, and the wretched
      lands immediately around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, though all intercourse between the two branches of the family had
      ceased, the younger had always felt a respect for the elder, as the head
      of the House. And it was supposed that, on her death-bed, Mrs. Egerton had
      recommended her impoverished namesakes and kindred to the care of her
      husband; for when he returned to town, after Mrs. Egerton's death, Audley
      had sent to Mr. Maunder Slugge Leslie the sum of L5000, which he said his
      wife, leaving no written will, had orally bequeathed as a legacy to that
      gentleman; and he requested permission to charge himself with the
      education of the eldest son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Maunder Slugge Leslie might have done great things for his little
      property with those L5000, or even kept in the three-per-cents the
      interest would have afforded a material addition to his comforts. But a
      neighbouring solicitor, having caught scent of the legacy, hunted it down
      into his own hands, on pretence of having found a capital investment in a
      canal; and when the solicitor had got possession of the L5000, he went off
      with them to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Randal, placed by Mr. Egerton at an excellent preparatory
      school, at first gave no signs of industry or talent; but just before he
      left it, there came to the school, as classical tutor, an ambitious young
      Oxford man; and his zeal&mdash;for he was a capital teacher&mdash;produced
      a great effect generally on the pupils, and especially on Randal Leslie.
      He talked to them much in private on the advantages of learning, and
      shortly afterwards he exhibited those advantages in his own person; for,
      having edited a Greek play with much subtle scholarship, his college,
      which some slight irregularities of his had displeased, recalled him to
      its venerable bosom by the presentation of a fellowship. After this he
      took orders, became a college tutor, distinguished himself yet more by a
      treatise on the Greek accent, got a capital living, and was considered on
      the high road to a bishopric. This young man, then, communicated to Randal
      the thirst for knowledge; and when the boy went afterwards to Eton, he
      applied with such earnestness and resolve that his fame soon reached the
      ears of Audley; and that person, who had the sympathy for talent, and yet
      more for purpose, which often characterizes ambitious men, went to Eton to
      see him. From that time Audley evinced great and almost fatherly interest
      in the brilliant Etonian; and Randal always spent with him some days in
      each vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that Egerton's conduct with respect to this boy was more
      praiseworthy than most of those generous actions for which he was
      renowned, since to this the world gave no applause. What a man does within
      the range of his family connections does not carry with it that eclat
      which invests a munificence exhibited on public occasions. Either people
      care nothing about it, or tacitly suppose it to be but his duty. It was
      true, too, as the squire had observed, that Randal Leslie was even less
      distantly related to the Hazeldeans than to Mrs. Egerton, since Randal's
      grandfather had actually married a Miss Hazeldean (the highest worldly
      connection that branch of the family had formed since the great split I
      have commemorated). But Audley Egerton never appeared aware of that fact.
      As he was not himself descended from the Hazeldeans, he did not trouble
      himself about their genealogy; and he took care to impress it upon the
      Leslies that his generosity on their behalf was solely to be ascribed to
      his respect for his wife's memory and kindred. Still the squire had felt
      as if his "distant brother" implied a rebuke on his own neglect of these
      poor Leslies, by the liberality Audley evinced towards them; and this had
      made him doubly sore when the name of Randal Leslie was mentioned. But the
      fact really was, that the Leslies of Rood had so shrunk out of all notice
      that the squire had actually forgotten their existence, until Randal
      became thus indebted to his brother; and then he felt a pang of remorse
      that any one save himself, the head of the Hazeldeans, should lend a
      helping hand to the grandson of a Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      But having thus, somewhat too tediously, explained the position of Audley
      Egerton, whether in the world or in relation to his young protege, I may
      now permit him to receive and to read his letters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Egerton glanced over the pile of letters placed beside him, and first
      he tore up some, scarcely read, and threw them into the waste-basket.
      Public men have such odd, out-of-the-way letters, that their waste-baskets
      are never empty,&mdash;letters from amateur financiers proposing new ways
      to pay off the National Debt; letters from America (never free!) asking
      for autographs; letters from fond mothers in country villages,
      recommending some miracle of a son for a place in the king's service;
      letters from free-thinkers in reproof of bigotry; letters from bigots in
      reproof of free-thinking; letters signed Brutus Redivivus, containing the
      agreeable information that the writer has a dagger for tyrants, if the
      Danish claims are not forthwith adjusted; letters signed Matilda or
      Caroline, stating that Caroline or Matilda has seen the public man's
      portrait at the Exhibition, and that a heart sensible to its attractions
      may be found at No. &mdash; Piccadilly; letters from beggars, impostors,
      monomaniacs, speculators, jobbers,&mdash;all food for the waste-basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the correspondence thus winnowed, Mr. Egerton first selected those on
      business, which he put methodically together in one division of his
      pocket-book; and secondly, those of a private nature, which he as
      carefully put into another. Of these last there were but three,&mdash;one
      from his steward, one from Harley L'Estrange, one from Randal Leslie. It
      was his custom to answer his correspondence at his office; and to his
      office, a few minutes afterwards, he slowly took his way. Many a passenger
      turned back to look again at the firm figure, which, despite the hot
      summer day, was buttoned up to the throat; and the black frock-coat thus
      worn well became the erect air and the deep, full chest of the handsome
      senator. When he entered Parliament Street, Audley Egerton was joined by
      one of his colleagues, also on his way to the cares of office.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few observations on the last debate this gentleman said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, can you dine with me next Saturday, to meet Lansmere? He
      comes up to town to vote for us on Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had asked some people to dine with me," answered Egerton, "but I will
      put them off. I see Lord Lansmere too seldom to miss any occasion to meet
      a man whom I respect so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So seldom! True, he is very little in town; but why don't you go and see
      him in the country? Good shooting,&mdash;pleasant, old-fashioned house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Westbourne, his house is 'nimium vicina Cremonae,' close to a
      borough in which I have been burned in effigy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! yes, I remember you first came into parliament for that snug
      little place; but Lansmere himself never found fault with your votes, did
      he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He behaved very handsomely, and said he had not presumed to consider me
      his mouthpiece; and then, too, I am so intimate with L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that queer fellow ever coming back to England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He comes, generally, every year, for a few days, just to see his father
      and mother, and then returns to the Continent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never meet him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He comes in September or October, when you, of course, are not in town,
      and it is in town that the Lansmeres meet him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why does he not go to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man in England but once a year, and for a few days, has so much to do
      in London, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he as amusing as ever?" Egerton nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So distinguished as he might be!" remarked Lord Westbourne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So distinguished as he is!" said Egerton, formally; "an officer selected
      for praise, even in such fields as Quatre Bras and Waterloo; a scholar,
      too, of the finest taste; and as an accomplished gentleman matchless!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like to hear one man praise another so warmly in these ill-natured
      days," answered Lord Westbourne. "But still, though L'Estrange is
      doubtless all you say, don't you think he rather wastes his life living
      abroad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And trying to be happy, Westbourne? Are you sure it is not we who waste
      our lives? But I can't stay to hear your answer. Here we are at the door
      of my prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Saturday, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Saturday. Good day."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next hour or more, Mr. Egerton was engaged on the affairs of the
      State. He then snatched an interval of leisure (while awaiting a report,
      which he had instructed a clerk to make him), in order to reply to his
      letters. Those on public business were soon despatched; and throwing his
      replies aside to be sealed by a subordinate hand, he drew out the letters
      which he had put apart as private.
    </p>
    <p>
      He attended first to that of his steward: the steward's letter was long,
      the reply was contained in three lines. Pitt himself was scarcely more
      negligent of his private interests and concerns than Audley Egerton; yet,
      withal, Audley Egerton was said by his enemies to be an egotist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next letter he wrote was to Randal, and that, though longer, was far
      from prolix: it ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   DEAR MR. LESLIE,&mdash;I appreciate your delicacy in consulting me
   whether you should accept Frank Hazeldean's invitation to call at
   the Hall. Since you are asked, I can see no objection to it. I
   should be sorry if you appeared to force yourself there; and for the
   rest, as a general rule, I think a young man who has his own way to
   make in life had better avoid all intimacy with those of his own age
   who have no kindred objects nor congenial pursuits.

   As soon as this visit is paid, I wish you to come to London. The
   report I receive of your progress at Eton renders it unnecessary, in
   my judgment, that you should return there. If your father has no
   objection, I propose that you should go to Oxford at the ensuing
   term. Meanwhile, I have engaged a gentleman, who is a fellow of
   Balliol, to read with you. He is of opinion, judging only by your
   high repute at Eton, that you may at once obtain a scholarship in
   that college. If you do so, I shall look upon your career in life
   as assured.

   Your affectionate friend, and sincere well-wisher, A. E.
</pre>
    <p>
      The reader will remark that in this letter there is a certain tone of
      formality. Mr. Egerton does not call his protege "Dear Randal," as would
      seem natural, but coldly and stiffly, "Dear Mr. Leslie." He hints, also,
      that the boy has his own way to make in life. Is this meant to guard
      against too sanguine notions of inheritance, which his generosity may have
      excited? The letter to Lord L'Estrange was of a very different kind from
      the others. It was long, and full of such little scraps of news and gossip
      as may interest friends in a foreign land; it was written gayly, and as
      with a wish to cheer his friend; you could see that it was a reply to a
      melancholy letter; and in the whole tone and spirit there was an
      affection, even to tenderness, of which those who most liked Audley
      Egerton would have scarcely supposed him capable. Yet, notwithstanding,
      there was a kind of constraint in the letter, which perhaps only the fine
      tact of a woman would detect. It had not that abandon, that hearty
      self-outpouring, which you might expect would characterize the letters of
      two such friends, who had been boys at school together, and which did
      breathe indeed in all the abrupt rambling sentences of his correspondent.
      But where was the evidence of the constraint? Egerton is off-hand enough
      where his pen runs glibly through paragraphs that relate to others; it is
      simply that he says nothing about himself,&mdash;that he avoids all
      reference to the inner world of sentiment and feeling! But perhaps, after
      all, the man has no sentiment and feeling! How can you expect that a
      steady personage in practical life, whose mornings are spent in Downing
      Street, and whose nights are consumed in watching Government bills through
      a committee, can write in the same style as an idle dreamer amidst the
      pines of Ravenna, or on the banks of Como?
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley had just finished this epistle, such as it was, when the attendant
      in waiting announced the arrival of a deputation from a provincial trading
      town, the members of which deputation he had appointed to meet at two
      o'clock. There was no office in London at which deputations were kept
      waiting less than at that over which Mr. Egerton presided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deputation entered,&mdash;some score or so of middle-aged,
      comfortable-looking persons, who, nevertheless, had their grievance, and
      considered their own interest, and those of the country, menaced by a
      certain clause in a bill brought in by Mr. Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mayor of the town was the chief spokesman, and he spoke well,&mdash;but
      in a style to which the dignified official was not accustomed. It was a
      slap-dash style,&mdash;unceremonious, free and easy,&mdash;an American
      style. And, indeed, there was something altogether in the appearance and
      bearing of the mayor which savoured of residence in the Great Republic. He
      was a very handsome man, but with a look sharp and domineering,&mdash;the
      look of a man who did not care a straw for president or monarch, and who
      enjoyed the liberty to speak his mind and "wallop his own nigger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His fellow-burghers evidently regarded him with great respect; and Mr.
      Egerton had penetration enough to perceive that Mr. Mayor must be a rich
      man, as well as an eloquent one, to have overcome those impressions of
      soreness or jealousy which his tone was calculated to create in the
      self-love of his equals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Egerton was far too wise to be easily offended by mere manner; and
      though he stared somewhat haughtily when he found his observations
      actually pooh-poohed, he was not above being convinced. There was much
      sense and much justice in Mr. Mayor's arguments, and the statesman civilly
      promised to take them into full consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then bowed out the deputation; but scarcely had the door closed before
      it opened again, and Mr. Mayor presented himself alone, saying aloud to
      his companions in the passage, "I forgot something I had to say to Mr.
      Egerton; wait below for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. Mayor," said Audley, pointing to a seat, "what else would you
      suggest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The mayor looked round to see that the door was closed; and then, drawing
      his chair close to Mr. Egerton's, laid his forefinger on that gentleman's
      arm, and said, "I think I speak to a man of the world, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Egerton bowed, and made no reply by word, but he gently removed his
      arm from the touch of the forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR.&mdash;"You observe, sir, that I did not ask the members whom we
      return to parliament to accompany us. Do better without 'em. You know they
      are both in Opposition,&mdash;out-and-outers."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON.&mdash;"It is a misfortune which the Government cannot
      remember when the question is whether the trade of the town itself is to
      be served or injured."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR.&mdash;"Well, I guess you speak handsome, sir. But you'd be glad
      to have two members to support ministers after the next election."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (smiling).&mdash;"Unquestionably, Mr. Mayor."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR.&mdash;"And I can do it, Mr. Egerton. I may say I have the town
      in my pocket; so I ought,&mdash;I spend a great deal of money in it. Now,
      you see, Mr. Egerton, I have passed a part of my life in a land of liberty&mdash;the
      United States&mdash;and I come to the point when I speak to a man of the
      world. I'm a man of the world myself, sir. And so, if the Government will
      do something for me, why, I'll do something for the Government. Two votes
      for a free and independent town like ours,&mdash;that's something, isn't
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (taken by surprise).&mdash;"Really, I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR (advancing his chair still nearer, and interrupting the
      official).&mdash;"No nonsense, you see, on one side or the other. The fact
      is, that I've taken it into my head that I should like to be knighted. You
      may well look surprised, Mr. Egerton,&mdash;trumpery thing enough, I dare
      say; still, every man has his weakness, and I should like to be Sir
      Richard. Well, if you can get me made Sir Richard, you may just name your
      two members for the next election,&mdash;that is, if they belong to your
      own set, enlightened men, up to the times. That's speaking fair and
      manful, is n't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (drawing himself up).&mdash;"I am at a loss to guess why you
      should select me, sir, for this very extraordinary proposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR (nodding good-humouredly).&mdash;"Why, you see, I don't go along
      with the Government; you're the best of the bunch. And may be you'd like
      to strengthen your own party. This is quite between you and me, you
      understand; honour's a jewel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (with great gravity).&mdash;"Sir, I am obliged by your good
      opinion; but I agree with my colleagues in all the great questions that
      affect the government of the country, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR (interrupting him).&mdash;"Ah, of course, you must say so; very
      right. But I guess things would go differently if you were Prime Minister.
      However, I have another reason for speaking to you about my little job.
      You see you were member for Lansmere once, and I think you only came in by
      a majority of two, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON.&mdash;"I know nothing of the particulars of that election; I
      was not present."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR.&mdash;"No; but luckily for you, two relations of mine were, and
      they voted for you. Two votes, and you came in by two. Since then, you
      have got into very snug quarters here, and I think we have a claim on you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON.&mdash;"Sir, I acknowledge no such claim; I was and am a
      stranger to Lansmere; and if the electors did me the honour to return me
      to parliament, it was in compliment rather to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR (again interrupting the official).&mdash;"Rather to Lord
      Lansmere, you were going to say; unconstitutional doctrine that, I fancy.
      Peer of the realm. But never mind, I know the world; and I'd ask Lord
      Lansmere to do my affair for me, only he is a pompous sort of man; might
      be qualmish: antiquated notions. Not up to snuff like you and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (in great disgust, and settling his papers before him).&mdash;"Sir,
      it is not in my department to recommend to his Majesty candidates for the
      honour of knighthood, and it is still less in my department to make
      bargains for seats in parliament."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR.&mdash;"Oh, if that's the case, you'll excuse me; I don't know
      much of the etiquette in these matters. But I thought that if I put two
      seats in your hands for your own friends, you might contrive to take the
      affair into your department, whatever it was. But since you say you agree
      with your colleagues, perhaps it comes to the same thing. Now, you must
      not suppose I want to sell the town, and that I can change and chop my
      politics for my own purpose. No such thing! I don't like the sitting
      members; I'm all for progressing, but they go too much ahead for me; and
      since the Government is disposed to move a little, why, I'd as lief
      support them as not. But, in common gratitude, you see," added the mayor,
      coaxingly, "I ought to be knighted! I can keep up the dignity, and do
      credit to his Majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (without looking up from his papers).&mdash;"I can only refer
      you, sir, to the proper quarter."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR (impatiently).&mdash;"Proper quarter! Well, since there is so
      much humbug in this old country of ours, that one must go through all the
      forms and get at the job regularly, just tell me whom I ought to go to."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (beginning to be amused as well as indignant).&mdash;"If you
      want a knighthood, Mr. Mayor, you must ask the Prime Minister; if you want
      to give the Government information relative to seats in parliament, you
      must introduce yourself to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the Secretary of the
      Treasury."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR.&mdash;"And if I go to the last chap, what do you think he'll
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (the amusement preponderating over the indignation).&mdash;"He
      will say, I suppose, that you must not put the thing in the light in which
      you have put it to me; that the Government will be very proud to have the
      confidence of yourself and your brother electors; and that a gentleman
      like you, in the proud position of mayor, may well hope to be knighted on
      some fitting occasion; but that you must not talk about the knighthood
      just at present, and must confine yourself to converting the unfortunate
      political opinions of the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MAYOR.&mdash;"Well, I guess that chap there would want to do me! Not
      quite so green, Mr. Egerton. Perhaps I'd better go at once to the
      fountain-head. How d' ye think the Premier would take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. EGERTON (the indignation preponderating over the amusement).&mdash;"Probably
      just as I am about to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Egerton rang the bell; the attendant appeared. "Show Mr. Mayor the way
      out," said the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mayor turned round sharply, and his face was purple. He walked
      straight to the door; but suffering the attendant to precede him along the
      corridor, he came back with a rapid stride, and clenching his hands, and
      with a voice thick with passion, cried, "Some day or other I will make you
      smart for this, as sure as my name's Dick Avenel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Avenel!" repeated Egerton, recoiling,&mdash;"Avenel!" But the mayor was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley fell into a deep and musing revery, which seemed gloomy, and lasted
      till the attendant announced that the horses were at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then looked up, still abstractedly, and saw his letter to Harley
      L'Estrange open on the table. He drew it towards him, and wrote, "A man
      has just left me, who calls himself Aven&mdash;" In the middle of the name
      his pen stopped. "No, no," muttered the writer, "what folly to reopen the
      old wounds there!" and he carefully erased the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley Egerton did not ride in the Park that day, as was his wont, but
      dismissed his groom; and, turning his horse's head towards Westminster
      Bridge, took his solitary way into the country. He rode at first slowly,
      as if in thought; then fast, as if trying to escape from thought. He was
      later than usual at the House that evening, and he looked pale and
      fatigued. But he had to speak, and he spoke well.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In spite of all his Machiavellian wisdom, Dr. Riccabocca had been foiled
      in his attempt to seduce Leonard Fairfield into his service, even though
      he succeeded in partially winning over the widow to his views. For to her
      he represented the worldly advantages of the thing. Lenny would learn to
      be fit for more than a day-labourer; he would learn gardening, in all its
      branches,&mdash;rise some day to be a head gardener. "And," said
      Riccabocca, "I will take care of his book-learning, and teach him whatever
      he has a head for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has a head for everything," said the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said the wise man, "everything shall go into it." The widow was
      certainly dazzled; for, as we have seen, she highly prized scholarly
      distinction, and she knew that the parson looked upon Riccabocca as a
      wondrous learned man. But still Riccabocca was said to be a Papist, and
      suspected to be a conjuror. Her scruples on both these points, the
      Italian, who was an adept in the art of talking over the fair sex, would
      no doubt have dissipated, if there had been any use in it; but Lenny put a
      dead stop to all negotiations. He had taken a mortal dislike to
      Riccabocca: he was very much frightened by him,&mdash;and the spectacles,
      the pipe, the cloak, the long hair, and the red umbrella; and said so
      sturdily, in reply to every overture, "Please, sir, I'd rather not; I'd
      rather stay along with Mother," that Riccabocca was forced to suspend all
      further experiments in his Machiavellian diplomacy. He was not at all cast
      down, however, by his first failure; on the contrary, he was one of those
      men whom opposition stimulates; and what before had been but a suggestion
      of prudence, became an object of desire. Plenty of other lads might no
      doubt be had on as reasonable terms as Lenny Fairfield; but the moment
      Lenny presumed to baffle the Italian's designs upon him, the special
      acquisition, of Lenny became of paramount importance in the eyes of Signor
      Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo, however, lost all his interest in the traps, snares, and gins
      which his master proposed to lay for Leonard Fairfield, in the more
      immediate surprise that awaited him on learning that Dr. Riccabocca had
      accepted an invitation to pass a few days at the Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be no one there but the family," said Riccabocca. "Poor
      Giacomo, a little chat in the servants' hall will do you good; and the
      squire's beef is more nourishing, after all, than the sticklebacks and
      minnows. It will lengthen your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The padrone jests," said Jackeymo, statelily; "as if any one could starve
      in his service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um," said Riccabocca. "At least, faithful friend, you have tried that
      experiment as far as human nature will permit;" and he extended his hand
      to his fellow-exile with that familiarity which exists between servant and
      master in the usages of the Continent. Jackeymo bent low, and a tear fell
      upon the hand he kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cospetto!" said Dr. Riccabocca, "a thousand mock pearls do not make up
      the cost of a single true one! The tears of women&mdash;we know their
      worth; but the tears of an honest man&mdash;Fie, Giacomo!&mdash;at least I
      can never repay you this! Go and see to our wardrobe."
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as his master's wardrobe was concerned, that order was pleasing to
      Jackeymo; for the doctor had in his drawers suits which Jackeymo
      pronounced to be as good as new, though many a long year had passed since
      they left the tailor's hands. But when Jackeymo came to examine the state
      of his own clothing department, his face grew considerably longer. It was
      not that he was without other clothes than those on his back,&mdash;quantity
      was there, but the quality! Mournfully he gazed on two suits, complete in
      three separate members of which man's raiments are composed: the one suit
      extended at length upon his bed, like a veteran stretched by pious hands
      after death; the other brought piecemeal to the invidious light,&mdash;the
      torso placed upon a chair, the limbs dangling down from Jackeymo's
      melancholy arm. No bodies long exposed at the Morgue could evince less
      sign of resuscitation than those respectable defuncts! For, indeed,
      Jackeymo had been less thrifty of his apparel, more profusus sui, than his
      master. In the earliest days of their exile, he preserved the decorous
      habit of dressing for dinner,&mdash;it was a respect due to the padrone,&mdash;and
      that habit had lasted till the two habits on which it necessarily depended
      had evinced the first symptoms of decay; then the evening clothes had been
      taken into morning wear, in which hard service they had breathed their
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, notwithstanding his general philosophical abstraction from
      such household details, had more than once said, rather in pity to
      Jackeymo than with an eye to that respectability which the costume of the
      servant reflects on the dignity of the master, "Giacomo, thou wantest
      clothes; fit thyself out of mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jackeymo had bowed his gratitude, as if the donation had been
      accepted; but the fact was that that same fitting out was easier said than
      done. For though-thanks to an existence mainly upon sticklebacks and
      minnows&mdash;both Jackeymo and Riccabocca had arrived at that state which
      the longevity of misers proves to be most healthful to the human frame,&mdash;namely,
      skin and bone,&mdash;yet the bones contained in the skin of Riccabocca all
      took longitudinal directions; while those in the skin of Jackeymo spread
      out latitudinally. And you might as well have made the bark of a Lombardy
      poplar serve for the trunk of some dwarfed and pollarded oak&mdash;in
      whose hollow the Babes of the Wood could have slept at their ease&mdash;as
      have fitted out Jackeymo from the garb of Riccabocca. Moreover, if the
      skill of the tailor could have accomplished that undertaking, the faithful
      Jackeymo would never have had the heart to avail himself of the generosity
      of his master. He had a sort of religious sentiment, too, about those
      vestments of the padrone. The ancients, we know, when escaping from
      shipwreck, suspended in the votive temple the garments in which they had
      struggled through the wave. Jackeymo looked on those relics of the past
      with a kindred superstition. "This coat the padrone wore on such an
      occasion. I remember the very evening the padrone last put on those
      pantaloons!" And coat and pantaloons were tenderly dusted, and carefully
      restored to their sacred rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, after all, what was to be done? Jackeymo was much too proud to
      exhibit his person to the eyes of the squire's butler in habiliments
      discreditable to himself and the padrone. In the midst of his perplexity
      the bell rang, and he went down into the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca was standing on the hearth under his symbolical representation
      of the "Patriae Exul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giacomo," quoth he, "I have been thinking that thou hast never done what
      I told thee, and fitted thyself out from my superfluities. But we are
      going now into the great world: visiting once begun, Heaven knows where it
      may stop. Go to the nearest town and get thyself clothes. Things are dear
      in England. Will this suffice?" And Riccabocca extended a five-pound note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo, we have seen, was more familiar with his master than we formal
      English permit our domestics to be with us; but in his familiarity he was
      usually respectful. This time, however, respect deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The padrone is mad!" he exclaimed; "he would fling away his whole fortune
      if I would let him. Five pounds English, or a hundred and twenty-six
      pounds Milanese! Santa Maria! unnatural father! And what is to become of
      the poor signorina? Is this the way you are to marry her in the foreign
      land?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giacomo," said Riccabocca, bowing his head to the storm, "the signorina
      to-morrow; to-day the honour of the House. Thy small-clothes, Giacomo,&mdash;miserable
      man, thy small-clothes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is just," said Jackeymo, recovering himself, and with humility; "and
      the padrone does right to blame me, but not in so cruel a way. It is just,&mdash;the
      padrone lodges and boards me, and gives me handsome wages, and he has a
      right to expect that I should not go in this figure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the board and the lodgment, good," said Riccabocca. "For the handsome
      wages, they are the visions of thy fancy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are no such thing," said Jackeymo, "they are only in arrear. As if
      the padrone could not pay them some day or other; as if I was demeaning
      myself by serving a master who did not intend to pay his servants! And
      can't I wait? Have I not my savings too? But be cheered, be cheered; you
      shall be contented with me. I have two beautiful suits still. I was
      arranging them when you rang for me. You shall see, you shall see."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jackeymo hurried from the room, hurried back into his own chamber,
      unlocked a little trunk which he kept at his bed-head, tossed out a
      variety of small articles, and from the deepest depth extracted a leathern
      purse. He emptied the contents on the bed. They were chiefly Italian
      coins, some five-franc pieces, a silver medallion inclosing a little image
      of his patron saint,&mdash;San Giacomo,&mdash;one solid English guinea,
      and somewhat more than a pound's worth in English silver. Jackeymo put
      back the foreign coins, saying prudently, "One will lose on them here;" he
      seized the English coins, and counted them out. "But are you enough, you
      rascals?" quoth he, angrily, giving them a good shake. His eye caught
      sight of the medallion,&mdash;he paused; and after eying the tiny
      representation of the saint with great deliberation, he added, in a
      sentence which he must have picked up from the proverbial aphorisms of his
      master,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the difference between the enemy who does not hurt me, and the
      friend who does not serve me? Monsignore San Giacomo, my patron saint, you
      are of very little use to me in the leathern bag; but if you help me to
      get into a new pair of small-clothes on this important occasion, you will
      be a friend indeed. Alla bisogna, Monsignore." Then, gravely kissing the
      medallion, he thrust it into one pocket, the coins into the other, made up
      a bundle of the two defunct suits, and muttering to himself, "Beast,
      miser, that I am, to disgrace the padrone with all these savings in his
      service!" ran downstairs into his pantry, caught up his hat and stick, and
      in a few moments more was seen trudging off to the neighbouring town of L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently the poor Italian succeeded, for he came back that evening in
      time to prepare the thin gruel which made his master's supper, with a suit
      of black,&mdash;a little threadbare, but still highly respectable,&mdash;two
      shirt fronts, and two white cravats. But out of all this finery, Jackeymo
      held the small-clothes in especial veneration; for as they had cost
      exactly what the medallion had sold for, so it seemed to him that San
      Giacomo had heard his prayer in that quarter to which he had more
      exclusively directed the saint's direction. The other habiliments came to
      him in the merely human process of sale and barter; the small-clothes were
      the personal gratuity of San Giacomo!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Life has been subjected to many ingenious comparisons; and if we do not
      understand it any better, it is not for want of what is called "reasoning
      by illustration." Amongst other resemblances, there are moments when, to a
      quiet contemplator, it suggests the image of one of those rotatory
      entertainments commonly seen in fairs, and known by the name of
      "whirligigs," or "roundabouts," in which each participator of the pastime,
      seated on his hobby, is always apparently in the act of pursuing some one
      before him, while he is pursued by some one behind. Man, and woman too,
      are naturally animals of chase; the greatest still find something to
      follow, and there is no one too humble not to be an object of prey to
      another. Thus, confining our view to the village of Hazeldean, we behold
      in this whirligig Dr. Riccabocca spurring his hobby after Lenny Fairfield;
      and Miss Jemima, on her decorous side-saddle, whipping after Dr.
      Riccabocca. Why, with so long and intimate a conviction of the villany of
      our sex, Miss Jemima should resolve upon giving the male animal one more
      chance of redeeming itself in her eyes, I leave to the explanation of
      those gentlemen who profess to find "their only books in woman's looks."
      Perhaps it might be from the over-tenderness and clemency of Miss Jemima's
      nature; perhaps it might be that as yet she had only experienced the
      villany of man born and reared in these cold northern climates, and in the
      land of Petrarch and Romeo, of the citron and myrtle, there was reason to
      expect that the native monster would be more amenable to gentle
      influences, less obstinately hardened in his iniquities. Without entering
      further into these hypotheses, it is sufficient to say that, on Signor
      Riccabocca's appearance in the drawing-room at Hazeldean, Miss Jemima felt
      more than ever rejoiced that she had relaxed in his favour her general
      hostility to men. In truth, though Frank saw something quizzical in the
      old-fashioned and outlandish cut of the Italian's sober dress; in his long
      hair, and the chapeau bras, over which he bowed so gracefully, and then
      pressed it, as if to his heart, before tucking it under his arm, after the
      fashion in which the gizzard reposes under the wing of a roasted pullet,&mdash;yet
      it was impossible that even Frank could deny to Riccabocca that praise
      which is due to the air and manner of an unmistakable gentleman. And
      certainly as, after dinner, conversation grew more familiar, and the
      parson and Mrs. Dale, who had been invited to meet their friend, did their
      best to draw him out, his talk, though sometimes a little too wise for his
      listeners, became eminently animated and agreeable. It was the
      conversation of a man who, besides the knowledge which is acquired from
      books and life, had studied the art which becomes a gentleman,&mdash;that
      of pleasing in polite society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was that all were charmed with him; and that even Captain
      Barnabas postponed the whist-table for a full hour after the usual time.
      The doctor did not play; he thus became the property of the two ladies,
      Miss Jemima and Mrs. Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated between the two, in the place rightfully appertaining to Flimsey,
      who this time was fairly dislodged, to her great wonder and discontent,
      the doctor was the emblem of true Domestic Felicity, placed between
      Friendship and Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friendship, as became her, worked quietly at the embroidered
      pocket-handkerchief and left Love to more animated operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be very lonely at the Casino," said Love, in a sympathizing
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," replied Riccabocca, gallantly, "I shall think so when I leave
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Friendship cast a sly glance at Love; Love blushed, or looked down on the
      carpet,&mdash;which comes to the same thing. "Yet," began Love again,&mdash;"yet
      solitude to a feeling heart&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca thought of the note of invitation, and involuntarily buttoned
      his coat, as if to protect the individual organ thus alarmingly referred
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Solitude to a feeling heart has its charms. It is so hard even for us
      poor ignorant women to find a congenial companion&mdash;but for YOU!" Love
      stopped short, as if it had said too much, and smelt confusedly at its
      bouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca cautiously lowered his spectacles, and darted one glance
      which, with the rapidity and comprehensiveness of lightning, seemed to
      envelop and take in, as it were, the whole inventory of Miss Jemima's
      personal attractions. Now Miss Jemima, as I have before observed, had a
      mild and pensive expression of countenance; and she would have been
      positively pretty had the mildness looked a little more alert, and the
      pensiveness somewhat less lackadaisical. In fact, though Miss Jemima was
      constitutionally mild, she was not de natura pensive; she had too much of
      the Hazeldean blood in her veins for that sullen and viscid humour called
      melancholy, and therefore this assumption of pensiveness really spoiled
      her character of features, which only wanted to be lighted up by a
      cheerful smile to be extremely prepossessing. The same remark might apply
      to the figure, which&mdash;thanks to the same pensiveness&mdash;lost all
      the undulating grace which movement and animation bestow on the fluent
      curves of the feminine form. The figure was a good figure, examined in
      detail,&mdash;a little thin, perhaps, but by no means emaciated, with just
      and elegant proportions, and naturally light and flexible. But the same
      unfortunate pensiveness gave to the whole a character of inertness and
      languor; and when Miss Jemima reclined on the sofa, so complete seemed the
      relaxation of nerve and muscle that you would have thought she had lost
      the use of her limbs. Over her face and form, thus defrauded of the charms
      Providence had bestowed on them, Dr. Riccabocca's eye glanced rapidly; and
      then moving nearer to Mrs. Dale&mdash;"Defend me" (he stopped a moment,
      and added) "from the charge of not being able to appreciate congenial
      companionship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I did not say that!" cried Miss Jemima.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," said the Italian, "if I am so dull as to misunderstand you.
      One may well lose one's head, at least, in such a neighbourhood as this."
      He rose as he spoke, and bent over Frank's shoulder to examine some views
      of Italy, which Miss Jemima (with what, if wholly unselfish, would have
      been an attention truly delicate) had extracted from the library in order
      to gratify the guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most interesting creature, indeed," sighed Miss Jemima, "but too&mdash;too
      flattering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," said Mrs. Dale, gravely, "do you think, love, that you could
      put off the end of the world a little longer, or must we make haste in
      order to be in time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How wicked you are!" said Miss Jemima, turning aside. Some few minutes
      afterwards, Mrs. Dale contrived it so that Dr. Riccabocca and herself were
      in a farther corner of the room, looking at a picture said to be by
      Wouvermans.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"She is very amiable, Jemima, is she not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Exceedingly so. Very fine battle-piece!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"So kind-hearted."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"All ladies are. How naturally that warrior makes his
      desperate cut at the runaway!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"She is not what is called regularly handsome, but she
      has something very winning."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA (with a smile).&mdash;"So winning, that it is strange she is
      not won. That gray mare in the foreground stands out very boldly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (distrusting the smile of Riccabocca, and throwing in a more
      effective grape-charge).&mdash;"Not won yet; and it is strange! she will
      have a very pretty fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE. "Six thousand pounds, I dare say,&mdash;certainly four."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA (suppressing a sigh, and with his wonted address).&mdash;"If
      Mrs. Dale were still single, she would never need a friend to say what her
      portion might be; but Miss Jemima is so good that I am quite sure it is
      not Miss Jemima's fault that she is still&mdash;Miss Jemima!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreigner slipped away as he spoke, and sat himself down beside the
      whist-players.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dale was disappointed, but certainly not offended. "It would be such
      a good thing for both," muttered she, almost inaudibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giacomo," said Riccabocca, as he was undressing that night in the large,
      comfortable, well-carpeted English bedroom, with that great English
      four-posted bed in the recess which seems made to shame folks out of
      single blessedness, "Giacomo, I have had this evening the offer of
      probably L6000, certainly of four thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cosa meravigliosa!"&mdash;["Miraculous thing."]&mdash;exclaimed Jackeymo,
      and he crossed himself with great fervour. "Six thousand pounds English!
      why, that must be a hundred thousand&mdash;blockhead that I am!&mdash;more
      than L150,000 Milanese!" And Jackeymo, who was considerably enlivened by
      the squire's ale, commenced a series of gesticulations and capers, in the
      midst of which he stopped and cried, "But not for nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing! no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "These mercenary English! the Government wants to bribe you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The priests want you to turn heretic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse than that!" said the philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse than that! O Padrone! for shame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be a fool, but pull off my pantaloons&mdash;they want me never to
      wear THESE again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never to wear what?" exclaimed Jackeymo, staring outright at his master's
      long legs in their linen drawers,&mdash;"never to wear&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The breeches," said Riccabocca, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The barbarians!" faltered Jackeymo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My nightcap! and never to have any comfort in this," said Riccabocca,
      drawing on the cotton head-gear; "and never to have any sound sleep in
      that," pointing to the four-posted bed; "and to be a bondsman and a
      slave," continued Riccabocca, waxing wroth; "and to be wheedled and purred
      at, and pawed and clawed, and scolded and fondled, and blinded and
      deafened, and bridled and saddled&mdash;bedevilled and&mdash;married!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married!" said Jackeymo, more dispassionately&mdash;"that's very bad,
      certainly; but more than a hundred and fifty thousand lire, and perhaps a
      pretty young lady, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty young lady!" growled Riccabocca, jumping into bed and drawing the
      clothes fiercely over him. "Put out the candle, and get along with you,&mdash;do,
      you villanous old incendiary!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not many days since the resurrection of those ill-omened stocks,
      and it was evident already, to an ordinary observer, that something wrong
      had got into the village. The peasants wore a sullen expression of
      countenance; when the squire passed, they took off their hats with more
      than ordinary formality, but they did not return the same broad smile to
      his quick, hearty "Good-day, my man." The women peered at him from the
      threshold or the casement, but did not, as was their wont (as least the
      wont of the prettiest), take occasion to come out to catch his passing
      compliment on their own good looks, or their tidy cottages. And the
      children, who used to play after work on the site of the old stocks, now
      shunned the place, and, indeed, seemed to cease play altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, no man likes to build, or rebuild, a great public work
      for nothing. Now that the squire had resuscitated the stocks, and made
      them so exceedingly handsome, it was natural that he should wish to put
      somebody into them. Moreover, his pride and self-esteem had been wounded
      by the parson's opposition; and it would be a justification to his own
      forethought, and a triumph over the parson's understanding, if he could
      satisfactorily and practically establish a proof that the stocks had not
      been repaired before they were wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, unconsciously to himself, there was something about the squire
      more burly and authoritative and menacing than heretofore. Old Gaffer
      Solomons observed, "that they had better moind well what they were about,
      for that the squire had a wicked look in the tail of his eye,&mdash;just
      as the dun bull had afore it tossed neighbour Barnes's little boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      For two or three days these mute signs of something brewing in the
      atmosphere had been rather noticeable than noticed, without any positive
      overt act of tyranny on the one hand or rebellion on the other. But on the
      very Saturday night in which Dr. Riccabocca was installed in the
      four-posted bed in the chintz chamber, the threatened revolution
      commenced. In the dead of that night personal outrage was committed on the
      stocks. And on the Sunday morning, Mr. Stirn, who was the earliest riser
      in the parish, perceived, in going to the farmyard, that the knob of the
      column that flanked the board had been feloniously broken off; that the
      four holes were bunged up with mud; and that some jacobinical villain had
      carved, on the very centre of the flourish or scroll-work, "Dam the
      stocks!" Mr. Stirn was much too vigilant a right-hand man, much too
      zealous a friend of law and order, not to regard such proceedings with
      horror and alarm. And when the squire came into his dressing-room at
      half-past seven, his butler (who fulfilled also the duties of valet)
      informed him, with a mysterious air, that Mr. Stirn had something "very
      partikler to communicate about a most howdacious midnight 'spiracy and
      'sault."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire stared, and bade Mr. Stirn be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" cried the squire, suspending the operation of stropping his razor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stirn groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, man, what now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knowed such a thing in this here parish afore," began Mr. Stirn;
      "and I can only 'count for it by s'posing that them foreign Papishers have
      been semminating&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Semminating&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disseminating, you blockhead,&mdash;disseminating what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn the stocks," began Mr. Stirn, plunging right in medias res, and by a
      fine use of one of the noblest figures in rhetoric.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Stirn!" cried the squire, reddening, "did you say, 'Damn the stocks'?&mdash;damn
      my new handsome pair of stocks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord forbid, sir; that's what they say: that's what they have digged on
      it with knives and daggers, and they have stuffed mud in its four holes,
      and broken the capital of the elewation."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire took the napkin off his shoulder, laid down strop and razor; he
      seated himself in his armchair majestically, crossed his legs, and, in a
      voice that affected tranquillity, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compose yourself, Stirn; you have a deposition to make, touching an
      assault upon&mdash;can I trust my senses?&mdash;upon my new stocks.
      Compose yourself; be calm. Now! What the devil is come to the parish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir, what indeed?" replied Mr. Stirn: and then laying the forefinger
      of the right hand on the palm of the left he narrated the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whom do you suspect? Be calm now; don't speak in a passion. You are a
      witness, sir,&mdash;a dispassionate, unprejudiced witness. Zounds and
      fury! this is the most insolent, unprovoked, diabolical&mdash;but whom do
      you suspect, I say?" Stirn twirled his hat, elevated his eyebrows, jerked
      his thumb over his shoulder, and whispered, "I hear as how the two
      Papishers slept at your honour's last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, dolt! do you suppose Dr. Rickeybockey got out of his warm bed to
      bung up the holes in my new stocks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noa; he's too cunning to do it himself, but he may have been semminating.
      He's mighty thick with Parson Dale, and your honour knows as how the
      parson set his face agin the stocks. Wait a bit, sir,&mdash;don't fly at
      me yet. There be a boy in this here parish&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A boy! ah, fool, now you are nearer the mark. The parson write 'Damn the
      stocks,' indeed! What boy do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that boy be cockered up much by Mr. Dale; and the Papisher went and
      sat with him and his mother a whole hour t' other day; and that boy is as
      deep as a well; and I seed him lurking about the place, and hiding hisself
      under the tree the day the stocks was put up,&mdash;and that 'ere boy is
      Lenny Fairfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whew," said the squire, whistling, "you have not your usual senses about
      you to-day, man. Lenny Fairfield,&mdash;pattern boy of the village. Hold
      your tongue. I dare say it is not done by any one in the parish, after
      all: some good-for-nothing vagrant&mdash;that cursed tinker, who goes
      about with a very vicious donkey,&mdash;a donkey that I caught picking
      thistles out of the very eyes of the old stocks! Shows how the tinker
      brings up his donkeys! Well, keep a sharp look-out. To-day is Sunday;
      worst day of the week, I'm sorry and ashamed to say, for rows and
      depredations. Between the services, and after evening church, there are
      always idle fellows from all the neighbouring country about, as you know
      too well. Depend on it, the real culprits will be found gathering round
      the stocks, and will betray themselves; have your eyes, ears, and wits
      about you, and I've no doubt we shall come to the rights of the matter
      before the day's out. And if we do," added the squire, "we'll make an
      example of the ruffian!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In course," said Stirn: "and if we don't find him we must make an example
      all the same. That's what it is, sir. That's why the stocks ben't
      respected; they has not had an example yet,&mdash;we wants an example."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my word I believe that's very true; and we'll clap in the first idle
      fellow you catch in anything wrong, and keep him there for two hours at
      least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the biggest pleasure, your honour,&mdash;that's what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Stirn having now got what he considered a complete and
      unconditional authority over all the legs and wrists of Hazeldean parish,
      quoad the stocks, took his departure.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Randal," said Mrs. Leslie on this memorable Sunday,&mdash;"Randal, do you
      think of going to Mr. Hazeldean's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am," answered Randal. "Mr. Egerton does not object to it; and as
      I do not return to Eton, I may have no other opportunity of seeing Frank
      for some time. I ought not to fail in respect to Mr. Egerton's natural
      heir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious me!" cried Mrs. Leslie, who, like many women of her cast and
      kind, had a sort of worldliness in her notions, which she never evinced in
      her conduct,&mdash;"gracious me! natural heir to the old Leslie property!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is Mr. Egerton's nephew, and," added Randal, ingenuously letting out
      his thoughts, "I am no relation to Mr. Egerton at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said poor Mrs. Leslie, with tears in her eyes, "it would be a shame
      in the man, after paying your schooling and sending you to Oxford, and
      having you to stay with him in the holidays, if he did not mean anything
      by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything, Mother, yes,&mdash;but not the thing you suppose. No matter. It
      is enough that he has armed me for life, and I shall use the weapons as
      seems to me best."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the dialogue was suspended by the entrance of the other members of
      the family, dressed for church.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be time for church! No, it can't," exclaimed Mrs. Leslie. She
      was never in time for anything,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last bell ringing," said Mr. Leslie, who, though a slow man, was
      methodical and punctual. Mrs. Leslie made a frantic rush at the door, the
      Montfydget blood being now in a blaze, dashed up the stairs, burst into
      her room, tore her best bonnet from the peg, snatched her newest shawl
      from the drawers, crushed the bonnet on her head, flung the shawl on her
      shoulders, thrust a desperate pin into its folds, in order to conceal a
      buttonless yawn in the body of her gown, and then flew back like a
      whirlwind. Meanwhile the family were already out of doors, in waiting; and
      just as the bell ceased, the procession moved from the shabby house to the
      dilapidated church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was a large one, but the congregation was small, and so was the
      income of the parson. It was a lay rectory, and the great tithes had
      belonged to the Leslies, but they had been long since sold. The vicarage,
      still in their gift, might be worth a little more than L100 a year. The
      present incumbent had nothing else to live upon. He was a good man, and
      not originally a stupid one; but penury and the anxious cares for wife and
      family, combined with what may be called solitary confinement for the
      cultivated mind, when, amidst the two-legged creatures round, it sees no
      other cultivated mind with which it can exchange one extra-parochial
      thought, had lulled him into a lazy mournfulness, which at times was very
      like imbecility. His income allowed him to do no good to the parish,
      whether in work, trade, or charity; and thus he had no moral weight with
      the parishioners beyond the example of his sinless life, and such negative
      effect as might be produced by his slumberous exhortations. Therefore his
      parishioners troubled him very little; and but for the influence which, in
      hours of Montfydget activity, Mrs. Leslie exercised over the most
      tractable,&mdash;that is, the children and the aged,&mdash;not
      half-a-dozen persons would have known or cared whether he shut up his
      church or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      But our family were seated in state in their old seignorial pew, and Mr.
      Dumdrum, with a nasal twang, went lugubriously through the prayers; and
      the old people who could sin no more, and the children who had not yet
      learned to sin, croaked forth responses that might have come from the
      choral frogs in Aristophanes; and there was a long sermon a propos to
      nothing which could possibly interest the congregation,&mdash;being, in
      fact, some controversial homily which Mr. Dumdrum had composed and
      preached years before. And when this discourse was over, there was a loud
      universal grunt, as if of relief and thanksgiving, and a great clatter of
      shoes, and the old hobbled, and the young scrambled, to the church door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after church, the Leslie family dined; and as soon as dinner
      was over, Randal set out on his foot journey to Hazeldean Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delicate and even feeble though his frame, he had the energy and quickness
      of movement which belongs to nervous temperaments; and he tasked the slow
      stride of a peasant, whom he took to serve him as a guide for the first
      two or three miles. Though Randal had not the gracious open manner with
      the poor which Frank inherited from his father, he was still (despite many
      a secret hypocritical vice at war with the character of a gentleman)
      gentleman enough to have no churlish pride to his inferiors. He talked
      little, but he suffered his guide to talk; and the boor, who was the same
      whom Frank had accosted, indulged in eulogistic comments on that young
      gentleman's pony, from which he diverged into some compliments on the
      young gentleman himself. Randal drew his hat over his brows. There is a
      wonderful tact and fine breeding in your agricultural peasant; and though
      Tom Stowell was but a brutish specimen of the class, he suddenly perceived
      that he was giving pain. He paused, scratched his head, and, glancing
      affectionately towards his companion, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I shall live to see you on a handsomer beastis than that little pony,
      Master Randal; and sure I ought, for you be as good a gentleman as any in
      the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Randal. "But I like walking better than riding,&mdash;I
      am more used to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and you walk bra'ly,&mdash;there ben't a better walker in the
      county. And very pleasant it is walking; and 't is a pretty country afore
      you, all the way to the Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal strode on, as if impatient of these attempts to flatter or to
      soothe; and coming at length into a broader lane, said, "I think I can
      find my way now. Many thanks to you, Tom;" and he forced a shilling into
      Tom's horny palm. The man took it reluctantly, and a tear started to his
      eye. He felt more grateful for that shilling than he had for Frank's
      liberal half-crown; and he thought of the poor fallen family, and forgot
      his own dire wrestle with the wolf at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed lingering in the lane till the figure of Randal was out of
      sight, and then returned slowly. Young Leslie continued to walk on at a
      quick pace. With all his intellectual culture and his restless
      aspirations, his breast afforded him no thought so generous, no sentiment
      so poetic, as those with which the unlettered clown crept slouchingly
      homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Randal gained a point where several lanes met on a broad piece of waste
      land, he began to feel tired, and his step slackened. Just then a gig
      emerged from one of these byroads, and took the same direction as the
      pedestrian. The road was rough and hilly, and the driver proceeded at a
      foot's pace; so that the gig and the pedestrian went pretty well abreast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem tired, sir," said the driver, a stout young farmer of the higher
      class of tenants, and he looked down compassionately on the boy's pale
      countenance and weary stride. "Perhaps we are going the same way, and I
      can give you a lift?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Randal's habitual policy to make use of every advantage proffered
      to him, and he accepted the proposal frankly enough to please the honest
      farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nice day, sir," said the latter, as Randal sat by his side. "Have you
      come far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Rood Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you be young Squire Leslie," said the farmer, more respectfully, and
      lifting his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my name is Leslie. You know Rood, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was brought up on your father's land, sir. You may have heard of Farmer
      Bruce?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"I remember, when I was a little boy, a Mr. Bruce who
      rented, I believe, the best part of our land, and who used to bring us
      cakes when he called to see my father. He is a relation of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FARMER BRUCE.&mdash;"He was my uncle. He is dead now, poor man."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.-"Dead! I am grieved to hear it. He was very kind to us children.
      But it is long since he left my father's farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      FARMER BRUCE (apologetically).&mdash;"I am sure he was very sorry to go.
      But, you see, he had an unexpected legacy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"And retired from business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FARMER BRUCE.&mdash;"No. But, having capital, he could afford to pay a
      good rent for a real good farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (bitterly).&mdash;"All capital seems to fly from the lands of Rood.
      And whose farm did he take?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FARMER BRUCE.&mdash;"He took Hawleigh, under Squire Hazeldean. I rent it
      now. We've laid out a power o' money on it. But I don't complain. It pays
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Would the money have paid as well sunk on my father's
      land?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FARMER BRUCE.&mdash;"Perhaps it might, in the long run. But then, sir, we
      wanted new premises,&mdash;barns and cattlesheds, and a deal more,&mdash;which
      the landlord should do; but it is not every landlord as can afford that.
      Squire Hazeldean's a rich man."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Ay!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The road now became pretty good, and the farmer put his horse into a brisk
      trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But which way be you going, sir? I don't care for a few miles more or
      less, if I can be of service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to Hazeldean," said Randal, rousing himself from a revery.
      "Don't let me take you out of your way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Hawleigh Farm is on the other side of the village, so it be quite my
      way, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer, then, who was really a smart young fellow,&mdash;one of that
      race which the application of capital to land has produced, and which, in
      point of education and refinement, are at least on a par with the squires
      of a former generation,&mdash;began to talk about his handsome horse,
      about horses in general, about hunting and coursing: he handled all these
      subjects with spirit, yet with modesty. Randal pulled his hat still lower
      down over his brows, and did not interrupt him till they passed the
      Casino, when, struck by the classic air of the place, and catching a scent
      from the orange-trees, the boy asked abruptly, "Whose house is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it belongs to Squire Hazeldean, but it is let or lent to a foreign
      mounseer. They say he is quite the gentleman, but uncommonly poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor," said Randal, turning back to gaze on the trim garden, the neat
      terrace, the pretty belvidere, and (the door of the house being open)
      catching a glimpse of the painted hall within,&mdash;"poor? The place
      seems well kept. What do you call poor, Mr. Bruce?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer laughed. "Well, that's a home question, sir. But I believe the
      mounseer is as poor as a man can be who makes no debts and does not
      actually starve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As poor as my father?" asked Randal, openly and abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord, sir! your father be a very rich man compared to him." Randal
      continued to gaze, and his mind's eye conjured up the contrast of his
      slovenly shabby home, with all its neglected appurtenances. No trim garden
      at Rood Hall, no scent from odorous orange blossoms. Here poverty at least
      was elegant,&mdash;there, how squalid! He did not comprehend at how cheap
      a rate the luxury of the Beautiful can be effected. They now approached
      the extremity of the squire's park pales; and Randal, seeing a little
      gate, bade the farmer stop his gig, and descended. The boy plunged amidst
      the thick oak groves; the farmer went his way blithely, and his mellow
      merry whistle came to Randal's moody ear as he glided quick under the
      shadow of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at the Hall to find that all the family were at church; and,
      according to the patriarchal custom, the churchgoing family embraced
      nearly all the servants. It was therefore an old invalid housemaid who
      opened the door to him. She was rather deaf, and seemed so stupid that
      Randal did not ask leave to enter and wait for Frank's return. He
      therefore said briefly that he would just stroll on the lawn, and call
      again when church was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman stared, and strove to hear him; meanwhile Randal turned
      round abruptly, and sauntered towards the garden side of the handsome old
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was enough to attract any eye in the smooth greensward of the
      spacious lawn, in the numerous parterres of variegated flowers, in the
      venerable grandeur of the two mighty cedars, which threw their still
      shadows over the grass, and in the picturesque building, with its
      projecting mullions and heavy gables; yet I fear that it was with no
      poet's nor painter's eye that this young old man gazed on the scene before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He beheld the evidence of wealth&mdash;and the envy of wealth jaundiced
      his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folding his arms on his breast, he stood a while, looking all around him,
      with closed lips and lowering brow; then he walked slowly on, his eyes
      fixed on the ground, and muttered to himself,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heir to this property is little better than a dunce; and they tell me
      I have talents and learning, and I have taken to my heart the maxim,
      'Knowledge is power.' And yet, with all my struggles, will knowledge ever
      place me on the same level as that on which this dunce is born? I don't
      wonder that the poor should hate the rich. But of all the poor, who should
      hate the rich like the pauper gentleman? I suppose Audley Egerton means me
      to come into parliament, and be a Tory like himself? What! keep things as
      they are! No; for me not even Democracy, unless there first come
      Revolution. I understand the cry of a Marat,&mdash;'More blood!' Marat had
      lived as a poor man, and cultivated science&mdash;in the sight of a
      prince's palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned sharply round, and glared vindictively on the poor old Hall,
      which, though a very comfortable habitation, was certainly no palace; and,
      with his arms still folded on his breast, he walked backward, as if not to
      lose the view, nor the chain of ideas it conjured up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," he continued to soliloquize,&mdash;"but of revolution there is no
      chance. Yet the same wit and will that would thrive in revolutions should
      thrive in this commonplace life. Knowledge is power. Well, then, shall I
      have no power to oust this blockhead? Oust him&mdash;what from? His
      father's halls? Well, but if he were dead, who would be the heir of
      Hazeldean? Have I not heard my mother say that I am as near in blood to
      this squire as any one, if he had no children? Oh, but the boy's life is
      worth ten of mine! Oust him from what? At least from the thoughts of his
      Uncle Egerton,&mdash;an uncle who has never even seen him! That, at least,
      is more feasible. 'Make my way in life,' sayest thou, Audley Egerton? Ay,&mdash;and
      to the fortune thou hast robbed from my ancestors. Simulation! simulation!
      Lord Bacon allows simulation. Lord Bacon practised it, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the soliloquy came to a sudden end; for as, rapt in his thoughts, the
      boy had continued to walk backwards, he had come to the verge where the
      lawn slided off into the ditch of the ha-ha; and just as he was fortifying
      himself by the precept and practice of my Lord Bacon, the ground went from
      under him, and&mdash;slap into the ditch went Randal Leslie!
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that the squire, whose active genius was always at some
      repair or improvement, had been but a few days before widening and sloping
      off the ditch just in that part, so that the earth was fresh and damp, and
      not yet either turfed or flattened down. Thus when Randal, recovering his
      first surprise and shock, rose to his feet, he found his clothes covered
      with mud; while the rudeness of the fall was evinced by the fantastic and
      extraordinary appearance of his hat, which, hollowed here, bulging there,
      and crushed out of all recognition generally, was as little like the hat
      of a decorous, hard-reading young gentleman&mdash;protege of the dignified
      Mr. Audley Egerton&mdash;as any hat picked out of a kennel after some
      drunken brawl possibly could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal was dizzy and stunned and bruised, and it was some moments before
      he took heed of his raiment. When he did so his spleen was greatly
      aggravated. He was still boy enough not to like the idea of presenting
      himself to the unknown squire and the dandy Frank in such a trim: he
      resolved incontinently to regain the lane and return home, without
      accomplishing the object of his journey; and seeing the footpath right
      before him, which led to a gate that he conceived would admit him into the
      highway sooner than the path by which he had come, he took it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is surprising how little we human creatures heed the warnings of our
      good genius. I have no doubt that some benignant power had precipitated
      Randal Leslie into the ditch, as a significant hint of the fate of all who
      choose what is, nowadays; by no means an uncommon step in the march of
      intellect,&mdash;namely, the walking backwards, in order to gratify a
      vindictive view of one's neighbour's property! I suspect that, before this
      century is out, many a fine fellow will thus have found his ha-ha, and
      scrambled out of the ditch with a much shabbier coat than he had on when
      he fell into it. But Randal did not thank his good genius for giving him a
      premonitory tumble,&mdash;and I never yet knew a man who did!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER, XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The squire was greatly ruffled at breakfast that morning. He was too much
      of an Englishman to bear insult patiently, and he considered that he had
      been personally insulted in the outrage offered to his recent donation to
      the parish. His feelings, too, were hurt as well as his pride. There was
      something so ungrateful in the whole thing, just after he had taken so
      much pains, not only in the resuscitation but the embellishment of the
      stocks. It was not, however, so rare an occurrence for the squire to be
      ruffled as to create any remark. Riccabocca, indeed, as a stranger, and
      Mrs. Hazeldean, as a wife, had the quick tact to perceive that the host
      was glum and the husband snappish; but the one was too discreet, and the
      other too sensible, to chafe the new sore, whatever it might be, and
      shortly after breakfast the squire retired into his study, and absented
      himself from morning service. In his delightful "Life of Oliver
      Goldsmith," Mr. Forster takes care to touch our hearts by introducing his
      hero's excuse for not entering the priesthood. "He did not feel himself
      good enough." Thy Vicar of Wakefield, poor Goldsmith, was an excellent
      substitute for thee; and Dr. Primrose, at least, will be good enough for
      the world until Miss Jemima's fears are realized. Now, Squire Hazeldean
      had a tenderness of conscience much less reasonable than Goldsmith's.
      There were occasionally days in which he did not feel good enough&mdash;I
      don't say for a priest, but even for one of the congregation,&mdash;"days
      in which," said the squire in his own blunt way, "as I have never in my
      life met a worse devil than a devil of a temper, I'll not carry mine into
      the family pew. He sha'n't be growling out hypocritical responses from my
      poor grandmother's prayer-book." So the squire and his demon stayed at
      home. But the demon was generally cast out before the day was over: and on
      this occasion, when the bell rang for afternoon service, it may be
      presumed that the squire had reasoned or fretted himself into a proper
      state of mind; for he was then seen sallying forth from the porch of his
      hall, arm-in-arm with his wife, and at the head of his household. The
      second service was (as is commonly the case in rural districts) more
      numerously attended than the first one; and it was our parson's wont to
      devote to this service his most effective discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parson Dale, though a very fair scholar, had neither the deep theology nor
      the archaeological learning that distinguish the rising generation of the
      clergy. I much doubt if he could have passed what would now be called a
      creditable examination in the Fathers; and as for all the nice formalities
      in the rubric, he would never have been the man to divide a congregation
      or puzzle a bishop. Neither was Parson Dale very erudite in ecclesiastical
      architecture. He did not much care whether all the details in the church
      were purely Gothic or not; crockets and finials, round arch and pointed
      arch, were matters, I fear, on which he had never troubled his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one secret Parson Dale did possess, which is perhaps of equal
      importance with those subtler mysteries,&mdash;he knew how to fill his
      church! Even at morning service no pews were empty, and at evening service
      the church overflowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parson Dale, too, may be considered nowadays to hold but a mean idea of
      the spiritual authority of the Church. He had never been known to dispute
      on its exact bearing with the State,&mdash;whether it was incorporated
      with the State or above the State, whether it was antecedent to the Papacy
      or formed from the Papacy, etc. According to his favourite maxim, "Quieta
      non movere,"&mdash;["Not to disturb things that are quiet."]&mdash;I have
      no doubt that he would have thought that the less discussion is provoked
      upon such matters the better for both Church and laity. Nor had he ever
      been known to regret the disuse of the ancient custom of excommunication,
      nor any other diminution of the powers of the priesthood, whether minatory
      or militant; yet for all this, Parson Dale had a great notion of the
      sacred privilege of a minister of the gospel,&mdash;to advise, to deter,
      to persuade, to reprove. And it was for the evening service that he
      prepared those sermons which may be called "sermons that preach at you."
      He preferred the evening for that salutary discipline, not only because
      the congregation was more numerous, but also because, being a shrewd man
      in his own innocent way, he knew that people bear better to be preached at
      after dinner than before; that you arrive more insinuatingly at the heart
      when the stomach is at peace. There was a genial kindness in Parson Dale's
      way of preaching at you. It was done in so imperceptible, fatherly, a
      manner that you never felt offended. He did it, too, with so much art that
      nobody but your own guilty self knew that you were the sinner he was
      exhorting. Yet he did not spare rich nor poor: he preached at the squire,
      and that great fat farmer, Mr. Bullock, the churchwarden, as boldly as at
      Hodge the ploughman and Scrub the hedger. As for Mr. Stirn, he had
      preached at him more often than at any one in the parish; but Stirn,
      though he had the sense to know it, never had the grace to reform. There
      was, too, in Parson Dale's sermons something of that boldness of
      illustration which would have been scholarly if he had not made it
      familiar, and which is found in the discourses of our elder divines. Like
      them, he did not scruple now and then to introduce an anecdote from
      history, or borrow an allusion from some non-scriptural author, in order
      to enliven the attention of his audience, or render an argument more
      plain. And the good man had an object in this, a little distinct from,
      though wholly subordinate to, the main purpose of his discourse. He was a
      friend to knowledge,&mdash;but to knowledge accompanied by religion; and
      sometimes his references to sources not within the ordinary reading of his
      congregation would spirit up some farmer's son, with an evening's leisure
      on his hands, to ask the parson for further explanation, and so to be
      lured on to a little solid or graceful instruction, under a safe guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on the present occasion, the parson, who had always his eye and heart
      on his flock, and who had seen with great grief the realization of his
      fears at the revival of the stocks; seen that a spirit of discontent was
      already at work amongst the peasants, and that magisterial and
      inquisitorial designs were darkening the natural benevolence of the
      squire,&mdash;seen, in short, the signs of a breach between classes, and
      the precursors of the ever inflammable feud between the rich and the poor,
      meditated nothing less than a great Political Sermon,&mdash;a sermon that
      should extract from the roots of social truths a healing virtue for the
      wound that lay sore, but latent, in the breast of his parish of Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus ran&mdash;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   For every man shall bear his own burden.&mdash;Gal. vi. 5.
</pre>
    <p>
      "BRETHREN! every man has his burden. If God designed our lives to end at
      the grave, may we not believe that He would have freed an existence so
      brief from the cares and sorrows to which, since the beginning of the
      world, mankind has been subjected? Suppose that I am a kind father, and
      have a child whom I dearly love, but I know by a divine revelation that he
      will die at the age of eight years, surely I should not vex his infancy by
      needless preparations for the duties of life? If I am a rich man, I should
      not send him from the caresses of his mother to the stern discipline of
      school. If I am a poor man, I should not take him with me to hedge and
      dig, to scorch in the sun, to freeze in the winter's cold: why inflict
      hardships on his childhood for the purpose of fitting him for manhood,
      when I know that he is doomed not to grow into man? But if, on the other
      hand, I believe my child is reserved for a more durable existence, then
      should I not, out of the very love I bear to him, prepare his childhood
      for the struggle of life, according to that station in which he is born,
      giving many a toil, many a pain, to the infant, in order to rear and
      strengthen him for his duties as man? So it is with our Father that is in
      heaven. Viewing this life as our infancy and the next as our spiritual
      maturity, where 'in the ages to come He may show the exceeding riches of
      His grace,' it is in His tenderness, as in His wisdom; to permit the toil
      and the pain which, in tasking the powers and developing the virtue of the
      soul, prepare it for 'the earnest of our inheritance.' Hence it is that
      every man has his burden. Brethren, if you believe that God is good, yea,
      but as tender as a human father, you will know that your troubles in life
      are a proof that you are reared for an eternity. But each man thinks his
      own burden the hardest to bear: the poor-man groans under his poverty, the
      rich man under the cares that multiply with wealth. For so far from wealth
      freeing us from trouble, all the wise men who have written in all ages
      have repeated, with one voice, the words of the wisest, 'When goods
      increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the
      owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?' And this is
      literally true, my brethren: for, let a man be as rich as was the great
      King Solomon himself, unless he lock up all his gold in a chest, it must
      go abroad to be divided amongst others; yea, though, like Solomon, he make
      him great works,&mdash;though he build houses and plant vineyards, and
      make him gardens and orchards,&mdash;still the gold that he spends feeds
      but the mouths he employs; and Solomon himself could not eat with a better
      relish than the poorest mason who builded the house, or the humblest
      labourer who planted the vineyard. Therefore 'when goods increase, they
      are increased that eat them.' And this, my brethren, may teach us
      toleration and compassion for the rich. We share their riches, whether
      they will or not; we do not share their cares. The profane history of our
      own country tells us that a princess, destined to be the greatest queen
      that ever sat on this throne, envied the milk-maid singing; and a profane
      poet, whose wisdom was only less than that of the inspired writers,
      represents the man who, by force&mdash;and wit, had risen to be a king
      sighing for the sleep vouchsafed to the meanest of his subjects,&mdash;all
      bearing out the words of the son of David, 'The sleep of the labouring man
      is sweet, whether he eat little or much; but the abundance of the rich
      will not suffer him to sleep.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amongst my brethren now present there is, doubtless, some one who has
      been poor, and by honest industry has made himself comparatively rich. Let
      his heart answer me while I speak: are not the chief cares that now
      disturb him to be found in the goods he hath acquired? Has he not both
      vexations to his spirit and trials to his virtue, which he knew not when
      he went forth to his labour, and took no heed of the morrow? But it is
      right, my brethren, that to every station there should be its care, to
      every man his burden; for if the poor did not sometimes so far feel
      poverty to be a burden as to desire to better their condition, and (to use
      the language of the world) 'seek to rise in life,' their most valuable
      energies would never be aroused; and we should not witness that spectacle,
      which is so common in the land we live in,&mdash;namely, the successful
      struggle of manly labour against adverse fortune,&mdash;a struggle in
      which the triumph of one gives hope to thousands. It is said that
      necessity is the mother of invention; and the social blessings which are
      now as common to us as air and sunshine have come from that law of our
      nature which makes us aspire towards indefinite improvement, enriches each
      successive generation by the labours of the last, and in free countries
      often lifts the child of the labourer to a place amongst the rulers of the
      land. Nay, if necessity is the mother of invention, poverty is the creator
      of the arts. If there had been no poverty, and no sense of poverty, where
      would have been that which we call the wealth of a country? Subtract from
      civilization all that has been produced by the poor, and what remains?&mdash;the
      state of the savage. Where you now see labourer and prince, you would see
      equality indeed,&mdash;the equality of wild men. No; not even equality
      there! for there brute force becomes lordship, and woe to the weak! Where
      you now see some in frieze, some in purple, you would see nakedness in
      all. Where stands the palace and the cot, you would behold but mud huts
      and caves. As far as the peasant excels the king among savages, so far
      does the society exalted and enriched by the struggles of labour excel the
      state in which Poverty feels no disparity, and Toil sighs for no ease. On
      the other hand, if the rich were perfectly contented with their wealth,
      their hearts would become hardened in the sensual enjoyments it procures.
      It is that feeling, by Divine Wisdom implanted in the soul, that there is
      vanity and vexation of spirit in the things of Mammon, which still leaves
      the rich man sensitive to the instincts of Heaven, and teaches him to seek
      for happiness in those beneficent virtues which distribute his wealth to
      the profit of others. If you could exclude the air from the rays of the
      fire, the fire itself would soon languish and die in the midst of its
      fuel; and so a man's joy in his wealth is kept alive by the air which it
      warms; and if pent within itself, is extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this, my brethren, leads me to another view of the vast subject
      opened to us by the words of the apostle, 'Every man shall bear his own
      burden.' The worldly conditions of life are unequal. Why are they unequal?
      O my brethren, do you not perceive? Think you that, if it had been better
      for our spiritual probation that there should be neither great nor lowly,
      rich nor poor, Providence would not so have ordered the dispensations of
      the world, and so, by its mysterious but merciful agencies, have
      influenced the framework and foundations of society? But if from the
      remotest period of human annals, and in all the numberless experiments of
      government which the wit of man has devised, still this inequality is ever
      found to exist, may we not suspect that there is something in the very
      principles of our nature to which that inequality is necessary and
      essential? Ask why this inequality? Why?&mdash;as well ask why life is the
      sphere of duty and the nursery of virtues! For if all men were equal, if
      there were no suffering and no ease, no poverty and no wealth, would you
      not sweep with one blow the half, at least, of human virtues from the
      world? If there were no penury and no pain, what would become of
      fortitude; what of patience; what of resignation? If there were no
      greatness and no wealth, what would become of benevolence, of charity, of
      the blessed human pity, of temperance in the midst of luxury, of justice
      in the exercise of power? Carry the question further; grant all conditions
      the same,&mdash;no reverse, no rise, and no fall, nothing to hope for,
      nothing to fear,&mdash;what a moral death you would at once inflict upon
      all the energies of the soul, and what a link between the Heart of Man and
      the Providence of God would be snapped asunder! If we could annihilate
      evil, we should annihilate hope; and hope, my brethren, is the avenue to
      faith. If there be 'a time to weep and a time to laugh,' it is that he who
      mourns may turn to eternity for comfort, and he who rejoices may bless God
      for the happy hour. Ah, my brethren, were it possible to annihilate the
      inequalities of human life, it would be the banishment of our worthiest
      virtues, the torpor of our spiritual nature, the palsy of our mental
      faculties. The moral world, like the world without us, derives its health
      and its beauty from diversity and contrast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Every man shall bear his own burden.' True; but now turn to an earlier
      verse in the same chapter,&mdash;'Bear ye one another's burdens, and so
      fulfil the law of Christ.' Yes, while Heaven ordains to each his peculiar
      suffering, it connects the family of man into one household, by that
      feeling which, more perhaps than any other, distinguishes us from the
      brute creation,&mdash;I mean the feeling to which we give the name of
      sympathy,&mdash;the feeling for each other! The herd of deer shun the stag
      that is marked by the gunner; the flock heedeth not the sheep that creeps
      into the shade to die; but man has sorrow and joy not in himself alone,
      but in the joy and sorrow of those around him. He who feels only for
      himself abjures his very nature as man; for do we not say of one who has
      no tenderness for mankind that he is inhuman; and do we not call him who
      sorrows with the sorrowful humane?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, brethren, that which especially marked the divine mission of our
      Lord is the direct appeal to this sympathy which distinguishes us from the
      brute. He seizes, not upon some faculty of genii given but to few, but
      upon that ready impulse of heart which is given to us all; and in saying,
      'Love one another,' 'Bear ye one another's burdens,' he elevates the most
      delightful of our emotions into the most sacred of His laws. The lawyer
      asks our Lord, 'Who is my neighbour?' Our Lord replies by the parable of
      the good Samaritan. The priest and the Levite saw the wounded man that
      fell among the thieves and passed by on the other side. That priest might
      have been austere in his doctrine, that Levite might have been learned in
      the law; but neither to the learning of the Levite nor to the doctrine of
      the priest does our Saviour even deign to allude. He cites but the action
      of the Samaritan, and saith to the lawyer, 'Which now of these three,
      thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he
      said, He that showed mercy unto him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do
      thou likewise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "O shallowness of human judgments! It was enough to be born a Samaritan in
      order to be rejected by the priest, and despised by the Levite. Yet now,
      what to us the priest and the Levite, of God's chosen race though they
      were? They passed from the hearts of men when they passed the sufferer by
      the wayside; while this loathed Samaritan, half thrust from the pale of
      the Hebrew, becomes of our family, of our kindred; a brother amongst the
      brotherhood of Love, so long as Mercy and Affliction shall meet in the
      common thoroughfare of Life!
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ.' Think
      not, O my brethren, that this applies only to almsgiving, to that relief
      of distress which is commonly called charity, to the obvious duty of
      devoting from our superfluities something that we scarcely miss to the
      wants of a starving brother. No. I appeal to the poorest amongst ye, if
      the worst burdens are those of the body,&mdash;if the kind word and the
      tender thought have not often lightened your hearts more than bread
      bestowed with a grudge, and charity that humbles you by a frown. Sympathy
      is a beneficence at the command of us all,&mdash;yea, of the pauper as of
      the king; and sympathy is Christ's wealth. Sympathy is brotherhood. The
      rich are told to have charity for the poor, and the poor are enjoined to
      respect their superiors. Good: I say not to the contrary. But I say also
      to the poor, 'In your turn have charity for the rich;' and I say to the
      rich, 'In your turn respect the poor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.' Thou, O
      poor man, envy not nor grudge thy brother his larger portion of worldly
      goods. Believe that he hath his sorrows and crosses like thyself, and
      perhaps, as more delicately nurtured, he feels them more; nay, hath he not
      temptations so great that our Lord hath exclaimed, 'How hardly shall they
      that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven'? And what are
      temptations but trials; what are trials but perils and sorrows? Think not
      that you can bestow no charity on the rich man, even while you take your
      sustenance from his hands. A heathen writer, often cited by the earliest
      preachers of the gospel, hath truly said, 'Wherever there is room for a
      man there is place for a benefit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I ask any rich brother amongst you, when he hath gone forth to survey
      his barns and his granaries, his gardens and orchards, if suddenly in the
      vain pride of his heart, he sees the scowl on the brow of the labourer,&mdash;if
      he deems himself hated in the midst of his wealth, if he feels that his
      least faults are treasured up against him with the hardness of malice, and
      his plainest benefits received with the ingratitude of envy,&mdash;I ask,
      I say, any rich man, whether straightway all pleasure in his worldly
      possessions does not fade from his heart, and whether he does not feel
      what a wealth of gladness it is in the power of the poor man to bestow!
      For all these things of Mammon pass away; but there is in the smile of him
      whom we have served a something that we may take with us into heaven. If,
      then, ye bear one another's burdens, they who are poor will have mercy on
      the errors and compassion for the griefs of the rich. To all men it was
      said&mdash;yes, to Lazarus as to Dives&mdash;'Judge not, that ye be not
      judged.' But think not, O rich man, that we preach only to the poor. If it
      be their duty not to grudge thee thy substance, it is thine to do all that
      may sweeten their labour. Remember that when our Lord said, 'How hardly
      shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of heaven,' He replied
      also to them who asked, 'Who then can be saved?' 'The things which are
      impossible with men are possible with God,' that is, man left to his own
      temptations would fail; but, strengthened by God, he shall be saved. If
      thy riches are the tests of thy trial, so may they also be the instruments
      of thy virtues. Prove by thy riches that thou art compassionate and
      tender, temperate and benign, and thy riches themselves may become the
      evidence at once of thy faith and of thy works.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have constantly on our lips the simple precept, 'Do unto others as you
      would be done by.' Why do we fail so often in the practice? Because we
      neglect to cultivate that SYMPATHY which nature implants as an instinct,
      and the Saviour exalts as a command. If thou wouldst do unto thy neighbour
      as thou wouldst be done by, ponder well how thy neighbour will regard the
      action thou art about to do to him. Put thyself into his place. If thou
      art strong and he is weak, descend from thy strength and enter into his
      weakness; lay aside thy burden for the while, and buckle on his own; let
      thy sight see as through his eyes, thy heart beat as in his bosom. Do
      this, and thou wilt often confess that what had seemed just to thy power
      will seem harsh to his weakness. For 'as a zealous man hath not done his
      duty when he calls his brother drunkard and beast,' even so an
      administrator of the law mistakes his object if he writes on the grand
      column of society only warnings that irritate the bold and terrify the
      timid; and a man will be no more in love with law than with virtue, 'if he
      be forced to it with rudeness and incivilities.' If, then, ye would bear
      the burden of the lowly, O ye great, feel not only for them, but with!
      Watch that your pride does not chafe them, your power does not wantonly
      gall. Your worldly inferior is of the class from which the Apostles were
      chosen, amidst which the Lord of Creation descended from a throne above
      the seraphs."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson here paused a moment, and his eye glanced towards the pew near
      the pulpit, where sat the magnate of Hazeldean. The squire was leaning his
      chin thoughtfully on his hand, his brow inclined downwards, and the
      natural glow of his complexion much heightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," resumed the parson, softly, without turning to his book, and rather
      as if prompted by the suggestion of the moment&mdash;"but he who has
      cultivated sympathy commits not these errors, or, if committing them,
      hastens to retract. So natural is sympathy to the good man that he obeys
      it mechanically when he suffers his heart to be the monitor of his
      conscience. In this sympathy, behold the bond between rich and poor! By
      this sympathy, whatever our varying worldly lots, they become what they
      were meant to be,&mdash;exercises for the virtues more peculiar to each;
      and thus, if in the body each man bear his own burden, yet in the
      fellowship of the soul all have common relief in bearing the burdens of
      each other. This is the law of Christ,&mdash;fulfil it, O my flock!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the parson closed his sermon, and the congregation bowed their heads.

      INITIAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SHOWING HOW MY NOVEL CAME TO BE CALLED "MY NOVEL."
    </h3>
    <p>
      "I am not displeased with your novel, so far as it has gone," said my
      father, graciously; "though as for the Sermon&mdash;" Here I trembled; but
      the ladies, Heaven bless them! had taken Parson Dale under their special
      protection; and observing that my father was puckering up his brows
      critically, they rushed forward boldly in defence of The Sermon, and Mr.
      Caxton was forced to beat a retreat. However, like a skilful general, he
      renewed the assault upon outposts less gallantly guarded. But as it is not
      my business to betray my weak points, I leave it to the ingenuity of
      cavillers to discover the places at which the Author of "Human Error"
      directed his great guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said the captain, "you are a lad of too much spirit, Pisistratus,
      to keep us always in the obscure country quarters of Hazeldean,&mdash;you
      will march us out into open service before you have done with us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (magisterially, for he has been somewhat nettled by Mr.
      Caxton's remarks, and he puts on an air of dignity in order to awe away
      minor assailants).&mdash;"Yes, Captain Roland; not yet a while, but all in
      good time. I have not stinted myself in canvas, and behind my foreground
      of the Hall and the Parsonage I propose hereafter to open some lengthened
      perspective of the varieties of English life&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Hum!"
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANCHE (putting her hand on my father's lip).&mdash;"We shall know better
      the design, perhaps, when we know the title. Pray, Mr. Author, what is the
      title?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MY MOTHER (with more animation than usual).&mdash;"Ay, Sisty, the title!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (startled).&mdash;"The title! By the soul of Cervantes! I have
      never yet thought of a title!"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN ROLAND (solemnly).&mdash;"There is a great deal in a good title.
      As a novel reader, I know that by experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS.&mdash;"Certainly; there is not a catchpenny in the world but
      what goes down, if the title be apt and seductive. Witness 'Old Parr's
      Life Pills.' Sell by the thousand, Sir, when my 'Pills for Weak Stomachs,'
      which I believe to be just the same compound, never paid for the
      advertising."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Parr's Life Pills! a fine stroke of genius. It is not
      every one who has a weak stomach, or time to attend to it if he have. But
      who would not swallow a pill to live to a hundred and fifty-two?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (stirring the fire in great excitement).&mdash;"My title! my
      title!&mdash;what shall be my title?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (thrusting his hand into his waistcoat, and in his most
      didactic of tones).&mdash;"From a remote period, the choice of a title has
      perplexed the scribbling portion of mankind. We may guess how their
      invention has been racked by the strange contortions it has produced. To
      begin with the Hebrews. 'The Lips of the Sleeping' (Labia Dormientium)&mdash;what
      book did you suppose that title to designate?&mdash;A Catalogue of
      Rabbinical Writers! Again, imagine some young lady of old captivated by
      the sentimental title of 'The Pomegranate with its Flower,' and opening on
      a Treatise on the Jewish Ceremonials! Let us turn to the Romans. Aulus
      Gellius commences his pleasant gossipping 'Noctes' with a list of the
      titles in fashion in his day. For instance, 'The Muses' and 'The Veil,'
      'The Cornucopia,' 'The Beehive,' and 'The Meadow.' Some titles, indeed,
      were more truculent, and promised food to those who love to sup upon
      horrors,&mdash;such as 'The Torch,' 'The Poniard,' 'The Stiletto'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (impatiently).&mdash;"Yes, sir, but to come to My Novel."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (unheeding the interruption).&mdash;"You see you have a fine
      choice here, and of a nature pleasing, and not unfamiliar, to a classical
      reader; or you may borrow a hint from the early dramatic writers."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (more hopefully).&mdash;"Ay, there is something in the Drama
      akin to the Novel. Now, perhaps, I may catch an idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"For instance, the author of the 'Curiosities of
      Literature' (from whom, by the way, I am plagiarizing much of the
      information I bestow upon you) tells us of a Spanish gentleman who wrote a
      Comedy, by which he intended to serve what he took for Moral Philosophy."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (eagerly).&mdash;"Well, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"And called it 'The Pain of the Sleep of the World.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Very comic, indeed, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Grave things were then called Comedies, as old things
      are now called Novels. Then there are all the titles of early Romance
      itself at your disposal,&mdash;'Theagenes and Chariclea' or 'The Ass' of
      Longus, or 'The Golden Ass' of Apuleius, or the titles of Gothic Romance,
      such as 'The most elegant, delicious, mellifluous, and delightful History
      of Perceforest, King of Great Britain.'" And therewith my father ran over
      a list of names as long as the Directory, and about as amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to my taste," said my mother, "the novels I used to read when a
      girl (for I have not read many since, I am ashamed to say)&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"No, you need not be at all ashamed of it, Kitty."
    </p>
    <p>
      MY MOTHER (proceeding).&mdash;"Were much more inviting than any you
      mention, Austin."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAPTAIN.&mdash;"True."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS.&mdash;"Certainly. Nothing like them nowadays!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MY MOTHER.&mdash;"'Says she to her Neighbour, What?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CAPTAIN.&mdash;"'The Unknown, or the Northern Gallery'&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS.&mdash;"'There is a Secret; Find it out!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (pushed to the verge of human endurance, and upsetting tongs,
      poker, and fire-shovel).&mdash;"What nonsense you are talking, all of you!
      For Heaven's sake consider what an important matter we are called upon to
      decide. It is not now the titles of those very respectable works which
      issued from the Minerva Press that I ask you to remember,&mdash;it is to
      invent a title for mine,&mdash;My Novel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (clapping his hands gently).&mdash;"Excellent! capital! Nothing
      can be better; simple, natural, pertinent, concise&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"What is it, sir, what is it? Have you really thought
      of a title to My Novel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"You have hit it yourself,&mdash;'My Novel.' It is your
      Novel; people will know it is your Novel. Turn and twist the English
      language as you will, be as allegorical as Hebrew, Greek, Roman, Fabulist,
      or Puritan, still, after all, it is your Novel, and nothing more nor less
      than your Novel."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (thoughtfully, and sounding the words various ways).&mdash;"'My
      Novel!'&mdash;um-um! 'My Novel!' rather bold&mdash;and curt, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Add what you say you intend it to depict,&mdash;Varieties
      in English Life."
    </p>
    <p>
      MY MOTHER.&mdash;"'My Novel; or, Varieties in English Life'&mdash;I don't
      think it sounds amiss. What say you, Roland? Would it attract you in a
      catalogue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      My uncle hesitates, when Mr. Caxton exclaims imperiously.&mdash;"The thing
      is settled! Don't disturb Camarina."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUILLS.&mdash;"If it be not too great a liberty, pray who or what is
      Camarina?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Camarina, Mr. Squills, was a lake, apt to be low, and
      then liable to be muddy; and 'Don't disturb Camarina' was a Greek proverb
      derived from an oracle of Apollo; and from that Greek proverb, no doubt,
      comes the origin of the injunction, 'Quieta non movere,' which became the
      favourite maxim of Sir Robert Walpole and Parson Dale. The Greek line, Mr.
      Squills" (here my father's memory began to warm), is preserved by
      Stephanus Byzantinus, 'De Urbibus,'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [Greek proverb]
</pre>
    <p>
      Zenobius explains it in his proverbs; Suidas repeats Zenobius; Lucian
      alludes to it; so does Virgil in the Third Book of the AEneid; and Silius
      Italicus imitates Virgil,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "'Et cui non licitum fatis Camarina moveri.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "Parson Dale, as a clergyman and a scholar, had, no doubt, these
      authorities at his fingers' end. And I wonder he did not quote them,"
      quoth my father; "but to be sure he is represented as a mild man, and so
      might not wish to humble the squire over-much in the presence of his
      family. Meanwhile, My Novel is My Novel; and now that, that matter is
      settled, perhaps the tongs, poker, and shovel may be picked up, the
      children may go to bed, Blanche and Kitty may speculate apart upon the
      future dignities of the Neogilos,&mdash;taking care, nevertheless, to
      finish the new pinbefores he requires for the present; Roland may cast up
      his account book, Mr. Squills have his brandy and water, and all the world
      be comfortable, each in his own way. Blanche, come away from the screen,
      get me my slippers, and leave Pisistratus to himself. [Greek line]&mdash;don't
      disturb Camarina. You see, my dear," added my father kindly, as, after
      settling himself into his slippers, he detained Blanche's hand in his own,&mdash;"you
      see, my dear, every house has its Camarina. Alan, who is a lazy animal, is
      quite content to let it alone; but woman, being the more active, bustling,
      curious creature, is always for giving it a sly stir."
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANCHE (with female dignity).&mdash;"I assure you, that if Pisistratus
      had not called me, I should not have&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (interrupting her, without lifting his eyes from the book he
      had already taken).&mdash;"Certainly you would not. I am now in the midst
      of the great Oxford Controversy. [The same Greek proverb]&mdash;don't
      disturb Camarina."
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence for half-an-hour, at the end of which&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (from behind the screen).&mdash;"Blanche, my dear, I want to
      consult you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche does not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Blanche, I say." Blanche glances in triumph towards
      Mr. Caxton.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (laying down his theological tract, and rubbing his spectacles
      mournfully).&mdash;"I hear him, child; I hear him. I retract my
      vindication of man. Oracles warn in vain: so long as there is a woman on
      the other side of the screen, it is all up with Camarina."

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is greatly to be regretted that Mr. Stirn was not present at the
      parson's Discourse; but that valuable functionary was far otherwise
      engaged,&mdash;indeed, during the summer months he was rarely seen at the
      afternoon service. Not that he cared for being preached at,&mdash;not he;
      Mr. Stirn would have snapped his fingers at the thunders of the Vatican.
      But the fact was, that Mr. Stirn chose to do a great deal of gratuitous
      business upon the day of rest. The squire allowed all persons who chose to
      walk about the park on a Sunday; and many came from a distance to stroll
      by the lake, or recline under the elms. These visitors were objects of
      great suspicion, nay, of positive annoyance, to Mr. Stirn&mdash;and,
      indeed, not altogether without reason, for we English have a natural love
      of liberty, which we are even more apt to display in the grounds of other
      people than in those which we cultivate ourselves. Sometimes, to his
      inexpressible and fierce satisfaction, Mr. Stirn fell upon a knot of boys
      pelting the swans; sometimes he missed a young sapling, and found it in
      felonious hands, converted into a walking-stick; sometimes he caught a
      hulking fellow scrambling up the ha-ha to gather a nosegay for his
      sweetheart from one of poor Mrs. Hazeldean's pet parterres; not
      infrequently, indeed, when all the family were fairly at church, some
      curious impertinents forced or sneaked their way into the gardens, in
      order to peep in at the windows. For these, and various other offences of
      like magnitude, Mr. Stirn had long, but vainly, sought to induce the
      squire to withdraw a permission so villanously abused. But though there
      were times when Mr. Hazeldean grunted and growled, and swore "that he
      would shut up the park, and fill it [illegally] with mantraps and
      spring-guns," his anger always evaporated in words. The park was still
      open to all the world on a Sunday; and that blessed day was therefore
      converted into a day of travail and wrath to Mr. Stirn. But it was from
      the last chime of the afternoon-service bell until dusk that the spirit of
      this vigilant functionary was most perturbed; for, amidst the flocks that
      gathered from the little hamlets round to the voice of the pastor, there
      were always some stray sheep, or rather climbing, desultory, vagabond
      goats, who struck off in all perverse directions, as if for the special
      purpose of distracting the energetic watchfulness of Mr. Stirn. As soon as
      church was over, if the day were fine, the whole park became a scene
      animated with red cloaks or lively shawls, Sunday waistcoats and hats
      stuck full of wildflowers&mdash;which last Mr. Stirn often stoutly
      maintained to be Mrs. Hazeldean's newest geraniums. Now, on this Sunday,
      especially, there was an imperative call upon an extra exertion of
      vigilance on the part of the superintendent,&mdash;he had not only to
      detect ordinary depredators and trespassers; but, first, to discover the
      authors of the conspiracy against the stocks; and, secondly, to "make an
      example."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had begun his rounds, therefore, from the early morning; and just as
      the afternoon bell was sounding its final peal, he emerged upon the
      village green from a hedgerow, behind which he had been at watch to
      observe who had the most suspiciously gathered round the stocks. At that
      moment the place was deserted. At a distance, the superintendent saw the
      fast disappearing forms of some belated groups hastening towards the
      church; in front, the stocks stood staring at him mournfully from its four
      great eyes, which had been cleansed from the mud, but still looked bleared
      and stained with the inarks of the recent outrage. Here Mr. Stirn paused,
      took off his hat, and wiped his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had sum 'un to watch here," thought he, "while I takes a turn by the
      water-side, p'r'aps summat might come out; p'r'aps them as did it ben't
      gone to church, but will come sneaking round to look on their willany! as
      they says murderers are always led back to the place where they ha' left
      the body. But in this here willage there ben't a man, woman, or child as
      has any consarn for squire or parish, barring myself." It was just as he
      arrived at that misanthropical conclusion that Mr. Stirn beheld Leonard
      Fairfield walking very fast from his own home. The superintendent clapped
      on his hat, and stuck his right arm akimbo. "Hollo, you, sir," said he, as
      Lenny now came in hearing, "where be you going at that rate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir, I be going to church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, sir,&mdash;stop, Master Lenny. Going to church!&mdash;why, the
      bell's done; and you knows the parson is very angry at them as comes in
      late, disturbing the congregation. You can't go to church now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I says you can't go to church now. You must learn to think a little of
      others, lad. You sees how I sweats to serve the squire! and you must serve
      him too. Why, your mother's got the house and premishes almost rent-free;
      you ought to have a grateful heart, Leonard Fairfield, and feel for his
      honour! Poor man! his heart is well-nigh bruk, I am sure, with the goings
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard opened his innocent blue eyes, while Mr. Stirn dolorously wiped
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at that 'ere dumb cretur," said Stirn, suddenly, pointing to the
      stocks,&mdash;"look at it. If it could speak, what would it say, Leonard
      Fairfield? Answer me that! 'Damn the stocks,' indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was very bad in them to write such naughty words," said Lenny,
      gravely. "Mother was quite shocked when she heard of it this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. STIRN.&mdash;"I dare say she was, considering what she pays for the
      premishes;" (insinuatingly) "you does not know who did it,&mdash;eh,
      Lenny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LENNY.&mdash;"No, sir; indeed I does not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. STIRN.&mdash;"Well, you see, you can't go to church,&mdash;prayers
      half over by this time. You recollex that I put them stocks under your
      'sponsibility,' and see the way you's done your duty by 'em! I've half a
      mind to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stirn cast his eyes on the eyes of the stocks. "Please, sir," began
      Lenny again, rather frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I won't please; it ben't pleasing at all. But I forgives you this
      time, only keep a sharp lookout, lad, in future. Now you must stay here&mdash;no,
      there&mdash;under the hedge, and you watches if any persons comes to
      loiter about, or looks at the stocks, or laughs to hisself, while I go my
      rounds. I shall be back either afore church is over or just arter; so you
      stay till I comes, and give me your report. Be sharp, boy, or it will be
      worse for you and your mother; I can let the premishes for L4 a year more
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Concluding with that somewhat menacing and very significant remark, and
      not staying for an answer, Mr. Stirn waved his hand and walked off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lenny remained by the stocks, very much dejected, and greatly
      disliking the neighbourhood to which the was consigned. At length he
      slowly crept off to the hedge, and sat himself down in the place of
      espionage pointed out to him. Now, philosophers tell us that what is
      called the point of honour is a barbarous feudal prejudice. Amongst the
      higher classes, wherein those feudal prejudices may be supposed to
      prevail, Lenny Fairfield's occupation would not have been considered
      peculiarly honourable; neither would it have seemed so to the more
      turbulent spirits among the humbler orders, who have a point of honour of
      their own, which consists in the adherence to each other in defiance of
      all lawful authority. But to Lenny Fairfield, brought up much apart from
      other boys, and with a profound and grateful reverence for the squire
      instilled into all his habits of thought, notions of honour bounded
      themselves to simple honesty and straightforward truth; and as he
      cherished an unquestioning awe of order and constitutional authority, so
      it did not appear to him that there was anything derogatory and debasing
      in being thus set to watch for an offender. On the contrary, as he began
      to reconcile himself to the loss of the church service, and to enjoy the
      cool of the summer shade and the occasional chirp of the birds, he got to
      look on the bright side of the commission to which he was deputed. In
      youth, at least, everything has its bright side,&mdash;even the
      appointment of Protector to the Parish Stocks. For the stocks itself
      Leonard had no affection, it is true; but he had no sympathy with its
      aggressors, and he could well conceive that the squire would be very much
      hurt at the revolutionary event of the night. "So," thought poor Leonard
      in his simple heart,&mdash;"so, if I can serve his honour, by keeping off
      mischievous boys, or letting him know who did the thing, I'm sure it would
      be a proud day for Mother." Then he began to consider that, however
      ungraciously Mr. Stirn had bestowed on him the appointment, still it was a
      compliment to him,&mdash;showed trust and confidence in him, picked him
      out from his contemporaries as the sober, moral, pattern boy; and Lenny
      had a great deal of pride in him, especially in matters of repute and
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things considered, I say, Leonard Fairfield reclined on his
      lurking-place, if not with positive delight and intoxicating rapture, at
      least with tolerable content and some complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stirn might have been gone a quarter of an hour, when a boy came
      through a little gate in the park, just opposite to Lenny's retreat in the
      hedge, and, as if fatigued with walking, or oppressed by the heat of the
      day, paused on the green for a moment or so, and then advanced under the
      shade of the great tree which overhung the stocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny pricked up his ears, and peeped out jealously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never seen the boy before: it was a strange face to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard Fairfield was not fond of strangers; moreover, he had a vague
      belief that strangers were at the bottom of that desecration of the
      stocks. The boy, then, was a stranger; but what was his rank? Was he of
      that grade in society in which the natural offences are or are not
      consonant to, or harmonious with, outrages upon stocks? On that Lenny
      Fairfield did not feel quite assured. According to all the experience of
      the villager, the boy was not dressed like a young gentleman. Leonard's
      notions of such aristocratic costume were naturally fashioned upon the
      model of Frank Hazeldean. They represented to him a dazzling vision of
      snow-white trousers and beautiful blue coats and incomparable cravats. Now
      the dress of this stranger, though not that of a peasant or of a farmer,
      did not in any way correspond with Lenny's notion of the costume of a
      young gentleman. It looked to him highly disreputable: the coat was
      covered with mud, and the hat was all manner of shapes, with a gap between
      the side and crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny was puzzled, till it suddenly occurred to him that the gate through
      which the boy had passed was in the direct path across the park from a
      small town, the inhabitants of which were in very bad odour at the Hall,&mdash;they
      had immemorially furnished the most daring poachers to the preserves, the
      most troublesome trespassers on the park, the most unprincipled orchard
      robbers, and the most disputatious asserters of various problematical
      rights of way, which, according to the Town, were public, and, according
      to the Hall, had been private since the Conquest. It was true that the
      same path led also directly from the squire's house, but it was not
      probable that the wearer of attire so equivocal had been visiting there.
      All things considered, Lenny had no doubt in his mind but that the
      stranger was a shop-boy or 'prentice from the town of Thorndyke; and the
      notorious repute of that town, coupled with this presumption, made it
      probable that Lenny now saw before him one of the midnight desecrators of
      the stocks. As if to confirm the suspicion, which passed through Lenny's
      mind with a rapidity wholly disproportionate to the number of lines it
      costs me to convey it, the boy, now standing right before the stocks, bent
      down and read that pithy anathema with which it was defaced. And having
      read it, he repeated it aloud, and Lenny actually saw him smile,&mdash;such
      a smile! so disagreeable and sinister! Lenny had never before seen the
      smile sardonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what were Lenny's pious horror and dismay when this ominous stranger
      fairly seated himself on the stocks, rested his heels profanely on the
      lids of two of the four round eyes, and taking out a pencil and a
      pocket-book, began to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this audacious Unknown taking an inventory of the church and the Hall
      for the purposes of conflagration? He looked at one and at the other, with
      a strange fixed stare as he wrote,&mdash;not keeping his eyes on the
      paper, as Lenny had been taught to do when he sat down to his copy-book.
      The fact is, that Randal Leslie was tired and faint, and he felt the shock
      of his fall the more, after the few paces he had walked, so that he was
      glad to rest himself a few moments; and he took that opportunity to write
      a line to Frank, to excuse himself for not calling again, intending to
      tear the leaf on which he wrote out of his pocket-book and leave it at the
      first cottage he passed, with instructions to take it to the Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Randal was thus innocently engaged, Lenny came up to him, with the
      firm and measured pace of one who has resolved, cost what it may, to do
      his duty. And as Lenny, though brave, was not ferocious, so the anger he
      felt and the suspicions he entertained only exhibited themselves in the
      following solemn appeal to the offender's sense of propriety,&mdash;"Ben't
      you ashamed of yourself? Sitting on the squire's new stocks! Do get up,
      and go along with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal turned round sharply; and though, at any other moment, he would
      have had sense enough to extricate himself very easily from his false
      position, yet Nemo mortalium, etc. No one is always wise. And Randal was
      in an exceedingly bad humour. The affability towards his inferiors, for
      which I lately praised him, was entirely lost in the contempt for
      impertinent snobs natural to an insulted Etonian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, eying Lenny with great disdain, Randal answered briefly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an insolent young blackguard."
    </p>
    <p>
      So curt a rejoinder made Lenny's blood fly to his face. Persuaded before
      that the intruder was some lawless apprentice or shop-lad, he was now more
      confirmed in that judgment, not only by language so uncivil, but by the
      truculent glance which accompanied it, and which certainly did not derive
      any imposing dignity from the mutilated, rakish, hang-dog, ruinous hat,
      under which it shot its sullen and menacing fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the various articles of which our male attire is composed, there is
      perhaps not one which has so much character and expression as the top
      covering. A neat, well-brushed, short-napped, gentlemanlike hat, put on
      with a certain air, gives a distinction and respectability to the whole
      exterior; whereas, a broken, squashed, higgledy-piggledy sort of a hat,
      such as Randal Leslie had on, would go far towards transforming the
      stateliest gentleman who ever walked down St. James's Street into the
      ideal of a ruffianly scamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it is well known that there is nothing more antipathetic to your
      peasant-boy than a shop-boy. Even on grand political occasions, the rural
      working-class can rarely be coaxed into sympathy with the trading town
      class. Your true English peasant is always an aristocrat. Moreover, and
      irrespectively of this immemorial grudge of class, there is something
      peculiarly hostile in the relationship between boy and boy when their
      backs are once up, and they are alone on a quiet bit of green,&mdash;something
      of the game-cock feeling; something that tends to keep alive, in the
      population of this island (otherwise so lamblike and peaceful), the
      martial propensity to double the thumb tightly over the four fingers, and
      make what is called "a fist of it." Dangerous symptoms of these mingled
      and aggressive sentiments were visible in Lenny Fairfield at the words and
      the look of the unprepossessing stranger. And the stranger seemed aware of
      them; for his pale face grew more pale, and his sullen eye more fixed and
      more vigilant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You get off them stocks," said Lenny, disdaining to reply to the coarse
      expressions bestowed on him; and, suiting the action to the word, he gave
      the intruder what he meant for a shove, but what Randal took for a blow.
      The Etonian sprang up, and the quickness of his movement, aided but by a
      slight touch of his hand, made Lenny lose his balance, and sent him
      neck-and-crop over the stocks. Burning with rage, the young villager rose
      alertly, and, flying at Randal, struck out right and left.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aid me, O ye Nine! whom the incomparable Persius satirized his
      contemporaries for invoking, and then, all of a sudden, invoked on his own
      behalf,&mdash;aid me to describe that famous battle by the stocks, and in
      defence of the stocks, which was waged by the two representatives of Saxon
      and Norman England. Here, sober support of law and duty and delegated
      trust,&mdash;pro aris et focis; there, haughty invasion and bellicose
      spirit of knighthood and that respect for name and person which we call
      "honour." Here, too, hardy physical force,&mdash;there, skilful
      discipline. Here&mdash;The Nine are as deaf as a post, and as cold as a
      stone! Plague take the jades! I can do better without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal was a year or two older than Lenny, but he was not so tall nor so
      strong, nor even so active; and after the first blind rush, when the two
      boys paused, and drew back to breathe, Lenny, eying the slight form and
      hueless cheek of his opponent, and seeing blood trickling from Randal's
      lip, was seized with an instantaneous and generous remorse. "It was not
      fair," he thought, "to fight one whom he could beat so easily." So,
      retreating still farther, and letting his arms fall to his side, he said
      mildly, "There, let's have no more of it; but go home and be good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie had no remarkable degree of that constitutional quality
      called physical courage; but he had some of those moral qualities which
      supply its place. He was proud, he was vindictive, he had high
      self-esteem, he had the destructive organ more than the combative,&mdash;what
      had once provoked his wrath it became his instinct to sweep away.
      Therefore, though all his nerves were quivering, and hot tears were in his
      eyes, he approached Lenny with the sternness of a gladiator, and said
      between his teeth, which he set hard, choking back the sob of rage and
      pain,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have struck me&mdash;and you shall not stir from this ground till I
      have made you repent it. Put up your hands,&mdash;defend yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny mechanically obeyed; and he had good need of the admonition; for if
      before he had had the advantage, now that Randal had recovered the
      surprise to his nerves, the battle was not to the strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Leslie had not been a fighting boy at Eton, still his temper had
      involved him in some conflicts when he was in the lower forms, and he had
      learned something of the art as well as the practice in pugilism,&mdash;an
      excellent thing too, I am barbarous enough to believe, and which I hope
      will never quite die out of our public schools. Ah, many a young duke has
      been a better fellow for life from a fair set-to with a trader's son; and
      many a trader's son has learned to look a lord more manfully in the face
      on the hustings, from the recollection of the sound thrashing he once gave
      to some little Lord Leopold Dawdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Randal now brought his experience and art to bear; put aside those
      heavy roundabout blows, and darted in his own, quick and sharp, supplying
      to the natural feebleness of his arm the due momentum of pugilistic
      mechanics. Ay, and the arm, too, was no longer so feeble; for strange is
      the strength that comes from passion and pluck!
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lenny, who had never fought before, was bewildered; his sensations
      grew so entangled that he could never recall them distinctly; he had a dim
      reminiscence of some breathless impotent rush, of a sudden blindness
      followed by quick flashes of intolerable light, of a deadly faintness,
      from which he was roused by sharp pangs&mdash;here&mdash;there&mdash;everywhere;
      and then all he could remember was, that he was lying on the ground,
      huddled up and panting hard, while his adversary bent over him with a
      countenance as dark and livid as Lara himself might have bent over the
      fallen Otho. For Randal Leslie was not one who, by impulse and nature,
      subscribed to the noble English maxim, "Never hit a foe when he is down;"
      and it cost him a strong, if brief, self-struggle not to set his heel on
      that prostrate form. It was the mind, not the heart, that subdued the
      savage within him, as muttering something inwardly&mdash;certainly not
      Christian forgiveness&mdash;the victor turned gloomily away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just at that precise moment, who should appear but Mr. Stirn! For, in
      fact, being extremely anxious to get Lenny into disgrace, he had hoped
      that he should have found the young villager had shirked the commission
      intrusted to him; and the right-hand man had slily come back to see if
      that amiable expectation were realized. He now beheld Lenny rising with
      some difficulty, still panting hard, and with hysterical sounds akin to
      what is vulgarly called blubbering, his fine new waistcoat sprinkled with
      his own blood, which flowed from his nose,&mdash;nose that seemed to Lenny
      Fairfield's feelings to be a nose no more, but a swollen, gigantic,
      mountainous Slawkenbergian excrescence; in fact, he felt all nose! Turning
      aghast from this spectacle, Mr. Stirn surveyed, with no more respect than
      Lenny had manifested, the stranger boy, who had again seated himself on
      the stocks (whether to recover his breath, or whether to show that his
      victory was consummated, and that he was in his rights of possession).
      "Hollo," said Mr. Stirn, "what is all this? What's the matter, Lenny, you
      blockhead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will sit there," answered Lenny, in broken gasps, "and he has beat me
      because I would not let him; but I doesn't mind that," added the villager,
      trying hard to suppress his tears, "and I am ready again for him&mdash;that
      I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you do lollopoping there on them blessed stocks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looking at the landscape; out of my light, man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This tone instantly inspired Mr. Stirn with misgivings: it was a tone so
      disrespectful to him that he was seized with involuntary respect; who but
      a gentleman could speak so to Mr. Stirn?
    </p>
    <p>
      "And may I ask who you be?" said Stirn, falteringly, and half inclined to
      touch his hat. "What Is your name, pray? What's your bizness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Randal Leslie, and my business was to visit your master's
      family,&mdash;that is, if you are, as I guess from your manner, Mr.
      Hazeldean's ploughman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Randal rose; and moving on a few paces, turned, and throwing
      half-a-crown on the road, said to Lenny, "Let that pay you for your
      bruises, and remember another time how you speak to a gentleman. As for
      you, fellow,"&mdash;and he pointed his scornful hand towards Mr. Stirn,
      who, with his mouth open, and his hat now fairly off, stood bowing to the
      earth,&mdash;"as for you, give my compliments to Mr. Hazeldean, and say
      that when he does us the honour to visit us at Rood Hall, I trust that the
      manners of our villagers will make him ashamed of Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, my poor Squire! Rood Hall ashamed of Hazeldean! If that message had
      been delivered to you, you would never have looked up again!
    </p>
    <p>
      With those bitter words, Randal swung himself over the stile that led into
      the parson's glebe, and left Lenny Fairfield still feeling his nose, and
      Mr. Stirn still bowing to the earth.

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie had a very long walk home; he was bruised and sore from head
      to foot, and his mind was still more sore and more bruised than his body.
      But if Randal Leslie had rested himself in the squire's gardens, without
      walking backwards and indulging in speculations suggested by Marat, and
      warranted by my Lord Bacon, he would have passed a most agreeable evening,
      and really availed himself of the squire's wealth by going home in the
      squire's carriage. But because he chose to take so intellectual a view of
      property, he tumbled into a ditch; because he tumbled into a ditch, he
      spoiled his clothes; because he spoiled his clothes, he gave up his visit;
      because he gave up his visit, he got into the village green, and sat on
      the stocks with a hat that gave him the air of a fugitive from the
      treadmill; because he sat on the stocks&mdash;with that hat, and a cross
      face under it&mdash;he had been forced into the most discreditable
      squabble with a clodhopper, and was now limping home, at war with gods and
      men; ergo (this is a moral that will bear repetition),&mdash;ergo, when
      you walk in a rich man's grounds, be contented to enjoy what is yours,
      namely, the prospect,&mdash;I dare say you will enjoy it more than he
      does!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If, in the simplicity of his heart and the crudity of his experience,
      Lenny Fairfield had conceived it probable that Mr. Stirn would address to
      him some words in approbation of his gallantry and in sympathy for his
      bruises, he soon found himself wofully mistaken. That truly great man,
      worthy prime minister of Hazeldean, might perhaps pardon a dereliction
      from his orders, if such dereliction proved advantageous to the interests
      of the service, or redounded to the credit of the chief; but he was
      inexorable to that worst of diplomatic offences,&mdash;an ill-timed,
      stupid, over-zealous obedience to orders, which, if it established the
      devotion of the employee, got the employer into what is popularly called a
      scrape! And though, by those unversed in the intricacies of the human
      heart, and unacquainted with the especial hearts of prime ministers and
      right-hand men, it might have seemed natural that Mr. Stirn, as he stood
      still, hat in hand, in the middle of the road, stung, humbled, and
      exasperated by the mortification he had received from the lips of Randal
      Leslie, would have felt that that young gentleman was the proper object of
      his resentment, yet such a breach of all the etiquette of diplomatic life
      as resentment towards a superior power was the last idea that would have
      suggested itself to the profound intellect of the premier of Hazeldean.
      Still, as rage, like steam, must escape somewhere, Mr. Stirn, on feeling&mdash;as
      he afterwards expressed it to his wife&mdash;that his "buzzom was a
      burstin'," turned with the natural instinct of self-preservation to the
      safety-valve provided for the explosion; and the vapours within him rushed
      into vent upon Lenny Fairfield. He clapped his hat on his head fiercely,
      and thus relieved his "buzzom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You young willain! you howdaeious wiper! and so all this blessed Sabbath
      afternoon, when you ought to have been in church on your marrow-bones, a
      praying for your betters, you has been a fitting with a young gentleman,
      and a wisiter to your master, on the wery place of the parridge
      hinstitution that you was to guard and pertect; and a bloodying it all
      over, I declares, with your blaggard little nose!" Thus saying, and as if
      to mend the matter, Mr. Stirn aimed an additional stroke at the offending
      member; but Lenny mechanically putting up both arms to defend his face,
      Mr. Stirn struck his knuckles against the large brass buttons that adorned
      the cuff of the boy's coat-sleeve,&mdash;an incident which considerably
      aggravated his indignation. And Lenny, whose spirit was fairly roused at
      what the narrowness of his education conceived to be a signal injustice,
      placing the trunk of the tree between Mr. Stirn and himself, began that
      task of self-justification which it was equally impolitic to conceive and
      imprudent to execute, since, in such a case, to justify was to
      recriminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder at you, Master Stirn,&mdash;if Mother could hear you! You know
      it was you who would not let me go to church; it was you who told me to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fit a young gentleman, and break the Sabbath," said Mr. Stirn,
      interrupting him with a withering sneer. "Oh, yes! I told you to disgrace
      his honour the squire, and me, and the parridge, and bring us all into
      trouble. But the squire told me to make an example, and I will!" With
      those words, quick as lightning flashed upon Mr. Stirn's mind the luminous
      idea of setting Lenny in the very stocks which he had too faithfully
      guarded. Eureka! the "example" was before him! Here he could gratify his
      long grudge against the pattern boy; here, by such a selection of the very
      best lad in the parish, he could strike terror into the worst; here he
      could appease the offended dignity of Randal Leslie; here was a practical
      apology to the squire for the affront put upon his young visitor; here,
      too, there was prompt obedience to the squire's own wish that the stocks
      should be provided as soon as possible with a tenant. Suiting the action
      to the thought, Mr. Stirn made a rapid plunge at his victim, caught him by
      the skirt of his jacket; and in a few seconds more, the jaws of the stocks
      had opened, and Lenny Fairfield was thrust therein,&mdash;a sad spectacle
      of the reverses of fortune. This done, and while the boy was too
      astounded, too stupefied, by the suddenness of the calamity, for the
      resistance he might otherwise have made,&mdash;nay, for more than a few
      inaudible words,&mdash;Mr. Stirn hurried from the spot, but not without
      first picking up and pocketing the half-crown designed for Lenny, and
      which, so great had been his first emotions, he had hitherto even almost
      forgotten. He then made his way towards the church, with the intention to
      place himself close by the door, catch the squire as he came out, whisper
      to him what had passed, and lead him, with the whole congregation at his
      heels, to gaze upon the sacrifice offered up to the joint powers of
      Nemesis and Themis.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Unaffectedly I say it&mdash;upon the honour of a gentleman, and the
      reputation of an author,&mdash;unaffectedly I say it, no words of mine can
      do justice to the sensations experienced by Lenny Fairfield, as he sat
      alone in that place of penance. He felt no more the physical pain of his
      bruises; the anguish of his mind stifled and overbore all corporeal
      suffering,&mdash;an anguish as great as the childish breast is capable of
      holding.
    </p>
    <p>
      For first and deepest of all, and earliest felt, was the burning sense of
      injustice. He had, it might be with erring judgment, but with all honesty,
      earnestness, and zeal, executed the commission entrusted to him; he had
      stood forth manfully in discharge of his duty; he had fought for it,
      suffered for it, bled for it. This was his reward! Now in Lenny's mind
      there was pre-eminently that quality which distinguishes the Anglo Saxon
      race,&mdash;the sense of justice. It was perhaps the strongest principle
      in his moral constitution; and the principle had never lost its virgin
      bloom and freshness by any of the minor acts of oppression and iniquity
      which boys of higher birth often suffer from harsh parents, or in
      tyrannical schools. So that it was for the first time that that iron
      entered into his soul, and with it came its attendant feeling,&mdash;the
      wrathful, galling sense of impotence. He had been wronged, and he had no
      means to right himself. Then came another sensation, if not so deep, yet
      more smarting and envenomed for the time,&mdash;shame! He, the good boy of
      all good boys; he, the pattern of the school, and the pride of the parson;
      he, whom the squire, in sight of all his contemporaries, had often singled
      out to slap on the back, and the grand squire's lady to pat on the head,
      with a smiling gratulation on his young and fair repute; he, who had
      already learned so dearly to prize the sweets of an honourable name,&mdash;he
      to be made, as it were, in the twinkling of an eye, a mark for opprobrium,
      a butt of scorn, a jeer, and a byword! The streams of his life were
      poisoned at the fountain. And then came a tenderer thought of his mother!
      of the shock this would be to her,&mdash;she who had already begun to look
      up to him as her stay and support; he bowed his head, and the tears, long
      suppressed, rolled down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he wrestled and struggled, and strove to wrench his limbs from that
      hateful bondage,&mdash;for he heard steps approaching. And he began to
      picture to himself the arrival of all the villagers from church, the sad
      gaze of the parson, the bent brow of the squire, the idle, ill-suppressed
      titter of all the boys, jealous of his unspotted character,&mdash;character
      of which the original whiteness could never, never be restored!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would always be the boy who had sat in the stocks! And the words
      uttered by the squire came back on his soul, like the voice of conscience
      in the ears of some doomed Macbeth: "A sad disgrace, Lenny,&mdash;you'll
      never be in such a quandary." "Quandary"&mdash;the word was unfamiliar to
      him; it must mean something awfully discreditable. The poor boy could have
      prayed for the earth to swallow him.

    <h3>
      "Kettles and frying-pans! what has us here?" cried the tinker.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This time Mr. Sprott was without his donkey; for it being Sunday, it is
      presumed that the donkey was enjoying his Sabbath on the common. The
      tinker was in his Sunday's best, clean and smart, about to take his lounge
      in the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny Fairfield made no answer to the appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You in the wood, my baby! Well, that's the last sight I should ha'
      thought to see. But we all lives to larn," added the tinker,
      sententiously. "Who gave you them leggins? Can't you speak, lad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nick Stirn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nick Stirn! Ay, I'd ha' ta'en my davy on that: and cos vy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cause I did as he told me, and fought a boy as was trespassing on these
      very stocks; and he beat me&mdash;but I don't care for that; and that boy
      was a young gentleman, and going to visit the squire; and so Nick Stirn&mdash;"
      Lenny stopped short, choked by rage and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Augh," said the tinker, starting, "you fit with a young gentleman, did
      you? Sorry to hear you confess that, my lad! Sit there and be thankful you
      ha' got off so cheap. 'T is salt and battery to fit with your betters, and
      a Lunnon justice o' peace would have given you two months o' the
      treadmill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But vy should you fit cos he trespassed on the stocks? It ben't your
      natural side for fitting, I takes it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny murmured something not very distinguishable about serving the
      squire, and doing as he was bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I sees, Lenny," interrupted the tinker, in a tone of great contempt,
      "you be one of those who would rayther 'unt with the 'ounds than run with
      the 'are! You be's the good pattern boy, and would peach agin your own
      border to curry favour with the grand folks. Fie, lad! you be sarved
      right; stick by your border, then you'll be 'spected when you gets into
      trouble, and not be 'varsally 'spised,&mdash;as you'll be arter
      church-time! Vell, I can't be seen 'sorting with you, now you are in this
      d'rogotary fix; it might hurt my c'r'acter, both with them as built the
      stocks and them as wants to pull 'em down. Old kettles to mend! Vy, you
      makes me forgit the Sabbath! Sarvent, my lad, and wish you well out of it;
      'specks to your mother, and say we can deal for the pan and shovel all the
      same for your misfortin."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinker went his way. Lenny's eye followed him with the sullenness of
      despair. The tinker, like all the tribe of human comforters, had only
      watered the brambles to invigorate the prick of the horns. Yes, if Lenny
      had been caught breaking the stocks, some at least would have pitied him;
      but to be incarcerated for defending them! You might as well have expected
      that the widows and orphans of the Reign of Terror would have pitied Dr.
      Guillotin when he slid through the grooves of his own deadly machine. And
      even the tinker, itinerant, ragamuffin vagabond as he was, felt ashamed to
      be found with the pattern boy! Lenny's head sank again on his breast
      heavily, as if it had been of lead. Some few minutes thus passed, when the
      unhappy prisoner became aware of the presence of another spectator to his
      shame; he heard no step, but he saw a shadow thrown over the sward. He
      held his breath, and would not look up, with some vague idea that if he
      refused to see he might escape being seen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Per Bacco!" said Dr. Riccabocca, putting his hand on Lenny's shoulder,
      and bending down to look into his face,&mdash;"per Bacco! my young friend,
      do you sit here from choice or necessity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny slightly shuddered, and winced under the touch of one whom he had
      hitherto regarded with a sort of superstitious abhorrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear," resumed Riccabocca, after waiting in vain for an answer to his
      question, "that though the situation is charming, you did not select it
      yourself. What is this?"&mdash;and the irony of the tone vanished&mdash;"what
      is this, my poor boy? You have been bleeding, and I see that those tears
      which you try to check come from a deep well. Tell me, povero fanciullo
      mio" (the sweet Italian vowels, though Lenny did not understand them,
      sounded softly and soothingly),&mdash;"tell me, my child, how all this
      happened. Perhaps I can help you; we have all erred,&mdash;we should all
      help each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny's heart, that just before had seemed bound in brass, found itself a
      way as the Italian spoke thus kindly, and the tears rushed down; but he
      again stopped them, and gulped out sturdily,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not done no wrong; it ben't my fault,&mdash;and 't is that which
      kills me!" concluded Lenny, with a burst of energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not done wrong? Then," said the philosopher, drawing out his
      pocket-handkerchief with great composure, and spreading it on the ground,&mdash;"then
      I may sit beside you. I could only stoop pityingly over sin, but I can lie
      down on equal terms with misfortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny Fairfield did not quite comprehend the words, but enough of their
      general meaning was apparent to make him cast a grateful glance on the
      Italian. Riccabocca resumed, as he adjusted the pocket-handkerchief, "I
      have a right to your confidence, my child, for I have been afflicted in my
      day; yet I too say with thee, 'I have not done wrong.' Cospetto!" (and
      here the doctor seated himself deliberately, resting one arm on the side
      column of the stocks, in familiar contact with the captive's shoulder,
      while his eye wandered over the lovely scene around)&mdash;"Cospetto! my
      prison, if they had caught me, would not have had so fair a look-out as
      this. But, to be sure, it is all one; there are no ugly loves, and no
      handsome prisons."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that sententious maxim, which, indeed, he uttered in his native
      Italian, Riccabocca turned round and renewed his soothing invitations to
      confidence. A friend in need is a friend indeed, even if he come in the
      guise of a Papist and wizard. All Lenny's ancient dislike to the foreigner
      had gone, and he told him his little tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca was much too shrewd a man not to see exactly the motives
      which had induced Mr. Stirn to incarcerate his agent (barring only that of
      personal grudge, to which Lenny's account gave him no clew). That a man
      high in office should make a scapegoat of his own watch-dog for an unlucky
      snap, or even an indiscreet bark, was nothing strange to the wisdom of the
      student of Machiavelli. However, he set himself to the task of consolation
      with equal philosophy and tenderness. He began by reminding, or rather
      informing, Leonard Fairfield of all the instances of illustrious men
      afflicted by the injustice of others that occurred to his own excellent
      memory. He told him how the great Epictetus, when in slavery, had a master
      whose favourite amusement was pinching his leg, which, as the amusement
      ended in breaking that limb, was worse than the stocks. He also told him
      the anecdote of Lenny's own gallant countryman, Admiral Byng, whose
      execution gave rise to Voltaire's celebrated witticism, "En Angleterre on
      tue un admiral pour encourager les autres."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   ["In England they execute one admiral in order to encourage the
   others."]
</pre>
    <p>
      Many other illustrations, still more pertinent to the case in point, his
      erudition supplied from the stores of history. But on seeing that Lenny
      did not seem in the slightest degree consoled by these memorable examples,
      he shifted his ground, and reducing his logic to the strict argumentum ad
      rem, began to prove, first, that there was no disgrace at all in Lenny's
      present position, that every equitable person would recognize the tyranny
      of Stirn and the innocence of its victim; secondly, that if even here he
      were mistaken, for public opinion was not always righteous, what was
      public opinion after all?&mdash;"A breath, a puff," cried Dr. Riccabocca,
      "a thing without matter,&mdash;without length, breadth, or substance,&mdash;a
      shadow, a goblin of our own creating. A man's own conscience is his sole
      tribunal, and he should care no more for that phantom 'opinion' than he
      should fear meeting a ghost if he crossed the churchyard at dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as Lenny did very much fear meeting a ghost if he crossed the
      churchyard at dark, the simile spoiled the argument, and he shook his head
      very mournfully. Dr. Riccabocca, was about to enter into a third course of
      reasoning, which, had it come to an end, would doubtless have settled the
      matter, and reconciled Lenny to sitting in the stocks till doomsday, when
      the captive, with the quick ear and eye of terror and calamity, became
      conscious that church was over, that the congregation in a few seconds
      more would be flocking thitherwards. He saw visionary hats and bonnets
      through the trees, which Riccabocca saw not, despite all the excellence of
      his spectacles; heard phantasmal rustlings and murmurings which Riccabocca
      heard not, despite all that theoretical experience in plots, stratagems,
      and treasons, which should have made the Italian's ear as fine as a
      conspirator's or a mole's. And with another violent but vain effort at
      escape, the prisoner exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, if I could but get out before they come! Let me out, let me out! Oh,
      kind sir, have pity,&mdash;let me out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diavolo!" said the philosopher, startled, "I wonder that I never thought
      of that before. After all, I believe he has hit the right nail on the
      head," and, looking close, he perceived that though the partition of wood
      had hitched firmly into a sort of spring-clasp, which defied Lenny's
      unaided struggles, still it was not locked (for, indeed, the padlock and
      key were snug in the justice-room of the squire, who never dreamed that
      his orders would be executed so literally and summarily as to dispense
      with all formal appeal to himself). As soon as Dr. Riccabocca made that
      discovery, it occurred to him that all the wisdom of all the schools that
      ever existed can't reconcile man or boy to a bad position&mdash;the moment
      there is a fair opportunity of letting him out of it. Accordingly, without
      more ado, he lifted up the creaking board, and Lenny Fairfield darted
      forth like a bird from a cage, halted a moment as if for breath, or in
      joy; and then, taking at once to his heels, fled, as a hare to its form,
      fast to his mother's home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca dropped the yawning wood into its place, picked up his
      handkerchief and restored it to his pocket; and then, with some curiosity,
      began to examine the nature of that place of duress which had caused so
      much painful emotion to its rescued victim. "Man is a very irrational
      animal at best," quoth the sage, soliloquizing, "and is frightened by
      strange buggaboos! 'T is but a piece of wood! how little it really
      injures! And, after all, the holes are but rests to the legs, and keep the
      feet out of the dirt. And this green bank to sit upon, under the shade of
      the elm-tree-verily the position must be more pleasant than otherwise!
      I've a great mind&mdash;" Here the doctor looked around, and seeing the
      coast still clear, the oddest notion imaginable took possession of him;
      yet, not indeed a notion so odd, considered philosophically,&mdash;for all
      philosophy is based on practical experiment,&mdash;and Dr. Riccabocca felt
      an irresistible desire practically to experience what manner of thing that
      punishment of the stocks really was. "I can but try! only for a moment,"
      said he apologetically to his own expostulating sense of dignity. "I have
      time to do it, before any one comes." He lifted up the partition again:
      but stocks are built on the true principle of English law, and don't
      easily allow a man to criminate himself,&mdash;it was hard to get into
      them without the help of a friend. However, as we before noticed,
      obstacles only whetted Dr. Riccabocca's invention. He looked round, and
      saw a withered bit of stick under the tree; this he inserted in the
      division of the stocks, somewhat in the manner in which boys place a stick
      under a sieve for the purpose of ensnaring sparrows; the fatal wood thus
      propped, Dr. Riceabocca sat gravely down on the bank, and thrust his feet
      through the apertures.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing in it!" cried he, triumphantly, after a moment's deliberation.
      "The evil is only in idea. Such is the boasted reason of mortals!" With
      that reflection, nevertheless, he was about to withdraw his feet from
      their voluntary dilemma, when the crazy stick suddenly gave way and the
      partition fell back into its clasp. Dr. Riceabocca was fairly caught,&mdash;"Facilis
      descensus&mdash;sed revocare gradum!" True, his hands were at liberty, but
      his legs were so long that, being thus fixed, they kept the hands from the
      rescue; and as Dr. Riccabocca's form was by no means supple, and the twin
      parts of the wood stuck together with that firmness of adhesion which
      things newly painted possess, so, after some vain twists and contortions,
      in which he succeeded at length (not without a stretch of the sinews that
      made them crack again) in finding the clasp and breaking his nails
      thereon, the victim of his own rash experiment resigned himself to his
      fate. Dr. Riceabocca was one of those men who never do things by halves.
      When I say he resigned himself, I mean not only Christian but
      philosophical resignation. The position was not quite so pleasant as,
      theoretically, he had deemed it; but he resolved to make himself as
      comfortable as he could. At first, as is natural in all troubles to men
      who have grown familiar with that odoriferous comforter which Sir Walter
      Raleigh is said first to have bestowed upon the Caucasian races, the
      doctor made use of his hands to extract from his pocket his pipe,
      match-box, and tobacco-pouch. After a few whiffs he would have been quite
      reconciled to his situation, but for the discovery that the sun had
      shifted its place in the heavens, and was no longer shaded from his face
      by the elm-tree. The doctor again looked round, and perceived that his red
      silk umbrella, which he had laid aside when he had seated himself by
      Lenny, was within arm's reach. Possessing himself of this treasure, he
      soon expanded its friendly folds. And thus, doubly fortified within and
      without, under shade of the umbrella, and his pipe composedly between his
      lips, Dr. Riceabocca gazed on his own incarcerated legs, even with
      complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'He who can despise all things,'" said he, in one of his native proverbs,
      "'possesses all things!'&mdash;if one despises freedom, one is free! This
      seat is as soft as a sofa! I am not sure," he resumed, soliloquizing,
      after a pause,&mdash;"I am not sure that there is not something more witty
      than manly and philosophical in that national proverb of mine which I
      quoted to the fanciullo, 'that there are no handsome prisons'! Did not the
      son of that celebrated Frenchman, surnamed Bras de Fer, write a book not
      only to prove that adversities are more necessary than prosperities, but
      that among all adversities a prison is the most pleasant and profitable?
      But is not this condition of mine, voluntarily and experimentally
      incurred, a type of my life? Is it the first time that I have thrust
      myself into a hobble? And if in a hobble of mine own choosing, why should
      I blame the gods?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Dr. Riceabocca fell into a train of musing so remote from time
      and place, that in a few minutes he no more remembered that he was in the
      parish stocks than a lover remembers that flesh is grass, a miser that
      mammon is perishable, a philosopher that wisdom is vanity. Dr. Riccabocca
      was in the clouds.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dullest dog that ever wrote a novel (and, entre nous, reader)&mdash;but
      let it go no further,&mdash;we have a good many dogs among the fraternity
      that are not Munitos might have seen with half an eye that the parson's
      discourse had produced a very genial and humanizing effect upon his
      audience.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [Munito was the name of a dog famous for his learning (a Porson of a
   dog) at the date of my childhood. There are no such dogs nowadays.]
</pre>
    <p>
      When all was over, and the congregation stood up to let Mr. Hazeldean and
      his family walk first down the aisle (for that was the custom at
      Hazeldean), moistened eyes glanced at the squire's sun-burned manly face,
      with a kindness that bespoke revived memory of many a generous benefit and
      ready service. The head might be wrong now and then,&mdash;the heart was
      in the right place after all. And the lady leaning on his arm came in for
      a large share of that gracious good feeling. True, she now and then gave a
      little offence when the cottages were not so clean as she fancied they
      ought to be,&mdash;and poor folks don't like a liberty taken with their
      houses any more than the rich do; true that she was not quite so popular
      with the women as the squire was, for, if the husband went too often to
      the ale-house, she always laid the fault on the wife, and said, "No man
      would go out of doors for his comforts, if he had a smiling face and a
      clean hearth at his home;" whereas the squire maintained the more gallant
      opinion that "If Gill was a shrew, it was because Jack did not, as in duty
      bound, stop her mouth with a kiss!" Still, notwithstanding these more
      obnoxious notions on her part, and a certain awe inspired by the stiff
      silk gown and the handsome aquiline nose, it was impossible, especially in
      the softened tempers of that Sunday afternoon, not to associate the
      honest, comely, beaming countenance of Mrs. Hazeldean with comfortable
      recollections of soups, jellies, and wine in sickness, loaves and blankets
      in winter, cheering words and ready visits in every little distress, and
      pretexts afforded by improvement in the grounds and gardens (improvements
      which, as the squire, who preferred productive labour, justly complained,
      "would never finish") for little timely jobs of work to some veteran
      grandsire, who still liked to earn a penny, or some ruddy urchin in a
      family that "came too fast." Nor was Frank, as he walked a little behind,
      in the whitest of trousers and the stiffest of neckcloths,&mdash;with a
      look of suppressed roguery in his bright hazel eye, that contrasted his
      assumed stateliness of mien,&mdash;without his portion of the silent
      blessing. Not that he had done anything yet to deserve it; but we all give
      youth so large a credit in the future. As for Miss Jemima, her trifling
      foibles only rose from too soft and feminine a susceptibility, too
      ivy-like a yearning for some masculine oak whereon to entwine her
      tendrils; and so little confined to self was the natural lovingness of her
      disposition, that she had helped many a village lass to find a husband, by
      the bribe of a marriage gift from her own privy purse; notwithstanding the
      assurances with which she accompanied the marriage gift,&mdash;namely,
      that "the bridegroom would turn out like the rest of his ungrateful sex;
      but that it was a comfort to think that it would be all one in the
      approaching crash!" So that she had her warm partisans, especially amongst
      the young; while the slim captain, on whose arm she rested her forefinger,
      was at least a civil-spoken gentleman, who had never done any harm, and
      who would doubtless do a deal of good if he belonged to the parish. Nay,
      even the fat footman who came last, with the family Prayer-book, had his
      due share in the general association of neighbourly kindness between hall
      and hamlet. Few were there present to whom he had not extended the
      right-hand of fellowship with a full horn of October in the clasp of it;
      and he was a Hazeldean man, too, born and bred, as two-thirds of the
      squire's household (now letting themselves out from their large pew under
      the gallery) were.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his part, too, you could see that the squire "was moved withal," and a
      little humbled moreover. Instead of walking erect, and taking bow and
      courtesy as a matter of course, and of no meaning, he hung his head
      somewhat, and there was a slight blush on his cheek; and as he glanced
      upward and round him&mdash;shyly, as it were&mdash;and his eye met those
      friendly looks, it returned them with an earnestness that had in it
      something touching as well as cordial,&mdash;an eye that said, as well as
      eye could say, "I don't quite deserve it, I fear, neighbours; but I thank
      you for your good-will with my whole heart." And so readily was that
      glance of the eye understood, that I think, if that scene had taken place
      out of doors instead of in the church, there would have been a hurrah as
      the squire passed out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Mr. Hazeldean got clear of the churchyard, ere Mr. Stirn was
      whispering in his ear. As Stirn whispered, the squire's face grew long,
      and his colour rose. The congregation, now flocking out of the church,
      exchanged looks with each other; that ominous conjunction between squire
      and man chilled back all the effects of the parson's sermon. The squire
      struck his cane violently into the ground. "I would rather you had told me
      Black Bess had got the glanders. A young gentleman, coming to visit my
      son, struck and insulted in Hazeldean; a young gentleman,&mdash;'s death,
      sir, a relation&mdash;his grandmother was a Hazeldean. I do believe
      Jemima's right, and the world's coming to an end! But Leonard Fairfield in
      the stocks! What will the parson say? and after such a sermon! 'Rich man,
      respect the poor!' And the good widow too; and poor Mark, who almost died
      in my arms! Stirn, you have a heart of stone! You confounded, lawless,
      merciless miscreant, who the deuce gave you the right to imprison man or
      boy in my parish of Hazeldean without trial, sentence, or warrant? Run and
      let the boy out before any one sees him: run, or I shall&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire elevated the cane, and his eyes shot fire. Mr. Stirn did not
      run, but he walked off very fast. The squire drew back a few paces, and
      again took his wife's arm. "Just wait a bit for the parson, while I talk
      to the congregation. I want to stop 'em all, if I can, from going into the
      village; but how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank heard, and replied readily,&mdash;"Give 'em some beer, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beer! on a Sunday! For shame, Frank!" cried Mrs. Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your tongue, Harry. Thank you, Frank," said the squire, and his brow
      grew as clear as the blue sky above him. I doubt if Riccabocca could have
      got him out of his dilemma with the same ease as Frank had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halt there, my men,&mdash;lads and lasses too,&mdash;there, halt a bit.
      Mrs. Fairfield, do you hear?&mdash;halt. I think his reverence has given
      us a capital sermon. Go up to the Great House all of you, and drink a
      glass to his health. Frank, go with them, and tell Spruce to tap one of
      the casks kept for the haymakers. Harry" (this in a whisper), "catch the
      parson, and tell him to come to me instantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Hazeldean, what has happened? You are mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bother; do what I tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where is the parson to find you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where? gadzooks, Mrs. H.,&mdash;at the stocks, to be sure!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca, awakened out of his revery by the sound of footsteps, was
      still so little sensible of the indignity of his position, that he enjoyed
      exceedingly, and with all the malice of his natural humour, the
      astonishment and stupor manifested by Stirn, when that functionary beheld
      the extraordinary substitute which fate and philosophy had found for Lenny
      Fairfield. Instead of the weeping, crushed, broken-hearted captive whom he
      had reluctantly come to deliver, he stared speechless and aghast upon the
      grotesque but tranquil figure of the doctor enjoying his pipe, and cooling
      himself under his umbrella, with a sangfroid that was truly appalling and
      diabolical. Indeed, considering that Stirn always suspected the Papisher
      of having had a hand in the whole of that black and midnight business, in
      which the stocks had been broken, bunged up, and consigned to perdition,
      and that the Papisher had the evil reputation of dabbling in the Black
      Art, the hocus-pocus way in which the Lenny he had incarcerated was
      transformed into the doctor he found, conjoined with the peculiarly
      strange eldrich and Mephistophelean physiognomy and person of Riccabocca,
      could not but strike a thrill of superstitious dismay into the breast of
      the parochial tyrant; while to his first confused and stammered
      exclamations and interrogatories, Riccabocca replied with so tragic an
      air, such ominous shakes of the head, such mysterious equivocating,
      long-worded sentences, that Stirn every moment felt more and more
      convinced that the boy had sold himself to the Powers of Darkness, and
      that he himself, prematurely and in the flesh, stood face to face with the
      Arch-Enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stirn had not yet recovered his wonted intelligence, which, to do him
      justice, was usually prompt enough, when the squire, followed hard by the
      parson, arrived at the spot. Indeed, Mrs. Hazeldean's report of the
      squire's urgent message, disturbed manner, and most unparalleled
      invitation to the parishioners, had given wings to Parson Dale's
      ordinarily slow and sedate movements. And while the squire, sharing
      Stirn's amazement, beheld indeed a great pair of feet projecting from the
      stocks, and saw behind them the grave face of Dr. Riccabocca under the
      majestic shade of the umbrella, but not a vestige of the only being his
      mind could identify with the tenancy of the stocks, Mr. Dale, catching him
      by the arm, and panting hard, exclaimed with a petulance he had never
      before been known to display,&mdash;except at the whist-table,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hazeldean, Mr. Hazeldean, I am scandalized,&mdash;I am shocked at
      you. I can bear a great deal from you, sir, as I ought to do; but to ask
      my whole congregation, the moment after divine service, to go up and
      guzzle ale at the Hall, and drink my health, as if a clergyman's sermon
      had been a speech at a cattle-fair! I am ashamed of you, and of the
      parish! What on earth has come to you all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the very question I wish to Heaven I could answer," groaned the
      squire, quite mildly and pathetically,&mdash;"What on earth has come to us
      all? Ask Stirn:" (then bursting out) "Stirn, you infernal rascal, don't
      you hear? What on earth has come to us all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Papisher is at the bottom of it, sir," said Stirn, provoked out of
      all temper. "I does my duty, but I is but a mortal man, arter all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mortal fiddlestick! Where's Leonard Fairfield, I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him knows best," answered Stirn, retreating mechanically for safety's
      sake behind the parson, and pointing to Dr. Riccabocca. Hitherto, though
      both the squire and parson had indeed recognized the Italian, they had
      merely supposed him to be seated on the bank. It never entered into their
      heads that so respectable and dignified a man could by any possibility be
      an inmate, compelled or voluntary, of the parish stocks. No, not even
      though, as I before said, the squire had seen, just under his nose, a very
      long pair of soles inserted in the apertures, that sight had only confused
      and bewildered him, unaccompanied, as it ought to have been, with the
      trunk and face of Lenny Fairfield. Those soles seemed to him optical
      delusions, phantoms of the overheated brain; but now, catching hold of
      Stirn, while the parson in equal astonishment caught hold of him, the
      squire faltered out, "Well, this beats cock-fighting! The man's as mad as
      a March hare, and has taken Dr. Rickeybockey for Little Lenny!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said the doctor, breaking silence with a bland smile, and
      attempting an inclination of the head as courteous as his position would
      permit,&mdash;"perhaps, if it be quite the same to you, before you proceed
      to explanations, you will just help me out of the stocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson, despite his perplexity and anger, could not repress a smile,
      as he approached his learned friend, and bent down for the purpose of
      extricating him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord love your reverence, you'd better not!" cried Mr. Stirn. "Don't be
      tempted,&mdash;he only wants to get you into is claws. I would not go a
      near him for all the&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech was interrupted by Dr. Riccabocca himself, who now, thanks to
      the parson, had risen into his full height, and half a head taller than
      all present&mdash;even than the tall squire&mdash;approached Mr. Stirn,
      with a gracious wave of the hand. Mr. Stirn retreated rapidly towards the
      hedge, amidst the brambles of which he plunged himself incontinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess whom you take me for, Mr. Stirn," said the Italian, lifting his
      hat with his characteristic politeness. "It is certainly a great honour;
      but you will know better one of these days, when the gentleman in question
      admits you to a personal interview in another&mdash;and a hotter world."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "But how on earth did you get into my new stocks?" asked the squire,
      scratching his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, Pliny the elder got into the crater of Mount Etna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he, and what for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To try what it was like, I suppose," answered Riccabocca. The squire
      burst out a laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so you got into the stocks to try what it was like. Well, I can't
      wonder,&mdash;it is a very handsome pair of stocks," continued the squire,
      with a loving look at the object of his praise. "Nobody need be ashamed of
      being seen in those stocks,&mdash;I'should not mind it myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had better move on," said the parson, dryly, "or we shall have the
      whole village here presently, gazing on the lord of the manor in the same
      predicament as that from which we have just extricated the doctor. Now,
      pray, what is the matter with Lenny Fairfield? I can't understand a word
      of what has passed. You don't mean to say that good Lenny Fairfield (who
      was absent from church, by the by) can have done anything to get into
      disgrace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he has though," cried the squire. "Stirn, I say, Stirn!" But Stirn
      had forced his way through the hedge and vanished. Thus left to his own
      powers of narrative at secondhand, Mr. Hazeldean now told all he had to
      communicate,&mdash;the assault upon Randal Leslie, and the prompt
      punishment inflicted by Stirn; his own indignation at the affront to his
      young kinsman, and his good-natured merciful desire to save the culprit
      from public humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson, mollified towards the rude and hasty invention of the
      beer-drinking, took the squire by the hand. "Ah, Mr. Hazeldean, forgive
      me," he said repentantly; "I ought to have known at once that it was only
      some ebullition of your heart that could stifle your sense of decorum. But
      this is a sad story about Lenny brawling and fighting on the Sabbath-day.
      So unlike him, too. I don't know what to make of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like or unlike," said the squire, "it has been a gross insult to young
      Leslie, and looks all the worse because I and Audley are not just the best
      friends in the world. I can't think what it is," continued Mr. Hazeldean,
      musingly; "but it seems that there must be always some association of
      fighting connected with that prim half-brother of mine. There was I, son
      of his own mother,&mdash;who might have been shot through the lungs, only
      the ball lodged in the shoulder! and now his wife's kinsman&mdash;my
      kinsman, too&mdash;grandmother a Hazeldean,&mdash;a hard-reading, sober
      lad, as I am given to understand, can't set his foot into the quietest
      parish in the three kingdoms, but what the mildest boy that ever was seen
      makes a rush at him like a mad bull. It is FATALITY!" cried the squire,
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ancient legend records similar instances of fatality in certain houses,"
      observed Riccabocca. "There was the House of Pelops, and Polynices and
      Eteocles, the sons of OEdipus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" said the parson; "but what's to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done?" said the squire; "why, reparation must be made to young Leslie.
      And though I wished to spare Lenny, the young ruffian, a public disgrace&mdash;for
      your sake, Parson Dale, and Mrs. Fairfield's&mdash;yet a good caning in
      private&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, sir!" said Riccabocca, mildly, "and hear me." The Italian then,
      with much feeling and considerable tact, pleaded the cause of his poor
      protege, and explained how Lenny's error arose only from mistaken zeal for
      the squire's service, and in the execution of the orders received from Mr.
      Stirn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That alters the matter," said the squire, softened; "and all that is
      necessary now will be for him to make a proper apology to my kinsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that is just," rejoined the parson; "but I still don't learn how he
      got out of the stocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca then resumed his tale; and, after confessing his own principal
      share in Lenny's escape, drew a moving picture of the boy's shame and
      honest mortification. "Let us march against Philip!" cried the Athenians
      when they heard Demosthenes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go at once and comfort the child!" cried the parson, before
      Riccabocca could finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that benevolent intention all three quickened their pace, and soon
      arrived at the widow's cottage. But Lenny had caught sight of their
      approach through the window; and not doubting that, in spite of
      Riccabocca's intercession, the parson was come to upbraid and the squire
      to re-imprison, he darted out by the back way, got amongst the woods, and
      lay there perdu all the evening. Nay, it was not till after dark that his
      mother&mdash;who sat wringing her hands in the little kitchen, and trying
      in vain to listen to the parson and Mrs. Dale, who (after sending in
      search of the fugitive) had kindly come to console the mother&mdash;heard
      a timid knock at the door and a nervous fumble at the latch. She started
      up, opened the door, and Lenny sprang to her bosom, and there buried his
      face, sobbing aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No harm, my boy," said the parson, tenderly; "you have nothing to fear,&mdash;all
      is explained and forgiven."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny looked up, and the veins on his forehead were much swollen. "Sir,"
      said he, sturdily, "I don't want to be forgiven,&mdash;I ain't done no
      wrong. And&mdash;I've been disgraced&mdash;and I won't go to school, never
      no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, Carry!" said the parson to his wife, who with the usual liveliness
      of her little temper, was about to expostulate. "Good-night, Mrs.
      Fairfield. I shall come and talk to you to-morrow, Lenny; by that time you
      will think better of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson then conducted his wife home, and went up to the Hall to report
      Lenny's safe return; for the squire was very uneasy about him, and had
      even in person shared the search. As soon as he heard Lenny was safe&mdash;"Well,"
      said the squire, "let him go the first thing in the morning to Rood Hall,
      to ask Master Leslie's pardon, and all will be right and smooth again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A young villain!" cried Frank, with his cheeks the colour of scarlet; "to
      strike a gentleman and an Etonian, who had just been to call on me! But I
      wonder Randal let him off so well,&mdash;any other boy in the sixth form
      would have killed him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank," said the parson, sternly, "if we all had our deserts, what should
      be done to him who not only lets the sun go down on his own wrath, but
      strives with uncharitable breath to fan the dying embers of another's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman here turned away from Frank, who bit his lip, and seemed
      abashed, while even his mother said not a word in his exculpation; for
      when the parson did reprove in that stern tone, the majesty of the Hall
      stood awed before the rebuke of the Church. Catching Riccabocca's
      inquisitive eye, Mr. Dale drew aside the philosopher, and whispered to him
      his fears that it would be a very hard matter to induce Lenny to beg
      Randal Leslie's pardon, and that the proud stomach of the pattern-boy
      would not digest the stocks with as much ease as a long regimen of
      philosophy had enabled the sage to do. This conference Miss Jemima soon
      interrupted by a direct appeal to the doctor respecting the number of
      years (even without any previous and more violent incident) that the world
      could possibly withstand its own wear and tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma'am," said the doctor, reluctantly summoned away to look at a passage
      in some prophetic periodical upon that interesting subject,&mdash;"ma'am,
      it is very hard that you should make one remember the end of the world,
      since, in conversing with you, one's natural temptation is to forget its
      existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jemima's cheeks were suffused with a deeper scarlet than Frank's had
      been a few minutes before. Certainly that deceitful, heartless compliment
      justified all her contempt for the male sex; and yet&mdash;such is human
      blindness&mdash;it went far to redeem all mankind in her credulous and too
      confiding soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is about to propose," sighed Miss Jemima.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giacomo," said Riccabocca, as he drew on his nightcap, and stepped
      majestically into the four-posted bed, "I think we shall get that boy for
      the garden now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus each spurred his hobby, or drove her car, round the Hazeldean
      whirligig.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whatever, may be the ultimate success of Miss Jemima Hazeldean's designs
      upon Dr. Riccabocca, the Machiavellian sagacity with which the Italian had
      counted upon securing the services of Lenny Fairfield was speedily and
      triumphantly established by the result. No voice of the parson's, charmed
      he ever so wisely, could persuade the peasant-boy to go and ask pardon of
      the young gentleman, to whom, because he had done as he was bid, he owed
      an agonizing defeat and a shameful incarceration; and, to Mrs. Dale's
      vexation, the widow took the boy's part. She was deeply offended at the
      unjust disgrace Lenny had undergone in being put in the stocks; she shared
      his pride, and openly approved his spirit. Nor was it without great
      difficulty that Lenny could be induced to resume his lessons at school,&mdash;nay,
      even to set foot beyond the precincts of his mother's holding. The point
      of the school at last he yielded, though sullenly; and the parson thought
      it better to temporize as to the more unpalatable demand. Unluckily,
      Lenny's apprehensions of the mockery that awaited him in the merciless
      world of his village were realized. Though Stirn at first kept his own
      counsel the tinker blabbed the whole affair. And after the search
      instituted for Lenny on the fatal night, all attempt to hush up what had
      passed would have been impossible. So then Stirn told his story, as the
      tinker had told his own; both tales were very unfavourable to Leonard
      Fairfield. The pattern-boy had broken the Sabbath, fought with his
      betters, and been well mauled into the bargain; the village lad had sided
      with Stirn and the authorities in spying out the misdemeanours of his
      equals therefore Leonard Fairfield, in both capacities of degraded
      pattern-boy and baffled spy, could expect no mercy,&mdash;he was ridiculed
      in the one, and hated in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that, in the presence of the schoolmaster and under the eye of
      Mr. Dale, no one openly gave vent to malignant feelings; but the moment
      those checks were removed, popular persecution began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some pointed and mowed at him, some cursed him for a sneak, and all
      shunned his society; voices were heard in the hedgerows, as he passed
      through the village at dusk, "Who was put into the stocks?&mdash;baa!"
      "Who got a bloody nob for playing spy to Nick Stirn?&mdash;baa!" To resist
      this species of aggression would have been a vain attempt for a wiser head
      and a colder temper than our poor pattern-boy's. He took his resolution at
      once, and his mother approved it; and the second or third day after Dr.
      Riccabocca's return to the Casino, Lenny Fairfield presented himself on
      the terrace with a little bundle in his hand. "Please, sir," said he to
      the doctor, who was sitting cross-legged on the balustrade, with his red
      silk umbrella over his head,&mdash;"please, sir, if you'll be good enough
      to take me now, and give me any hole to sleep in, I'll work for your
      honour night and day; and as for wages, Mother says, 'just suit yourself,
      sir.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My child," said the doctor, taking Lenny by the hand, and looking at him
      with the sagacious eye of a wizard, "I knew you would come! and Giacomo is
      already prepared for you! As to wages, we'll talk of them by and by."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny being thus settled, his mother looked for some evenings on the
      vacant chair, where he had so long sat in the place of her beloved Mark;
      and the chair seemed so comfortless and desolate, thus left all to itself,
      that she could bear it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed the village had grown as distasteful to her as to Lenny,&mdash;perhaps
      more so; and one morning she hailed the steward as he was trotting his
      hog-maued cob beside the door, and bade him tell the squire that "she
      would take it very kind if he would let her off the six months' notice for
      the land and premises she held; there were plenty to step into the place
      at a much better rent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a fool," said the good-natured steward; "and I'm very glad you did
      not speak to that fellow Stirn instead of to me. You've been doing
      extremely well here, and have the place, I may say, for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' as to rent, sir, but a great deal as to feelin'," said the widow.
      "And now Lenny has gone to work with the foreign gentleman, I should like
      to go and live near him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes, I heard Lenny had taken himself off to the Casino, more fool he;
      but, bless your heart, 't is no distance,&mdash;two miles or so. Can't he
      come home every night after work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," exclaimed the widow, almost fiercely; "he sha'n't come home
      here, to be called bad names and jeered at!&mdash;he whom my dead good man
      was so fond and proud of. No, sir; we poor folks have our feelings, as I
      said to Mrs. Dale, and as I will say to the squire hisself. Not that I
      don't thank him for all favours,&mdash;he be a good gentleman if let
      alone; but he says he won't come near us till Lenny goes and axes pardin.
      Pardin for what, I should like to know? Poor lamb! I wish you could ha'
      seen his nose, sir,&mdash;as big as your two fists. Ax pardin! if the
      squire had had such a nose as that, I don't think it's pardin he'd been
      ha' axing. But I let the passion get the better of me,&mdash;I humbly beg
      you'll excuse it, sir. I'm no schollard, as poor Mark was, and Lenny would
      have been, if the Lord had not visited us otherways. Therefore just get
      the squire to let me go as soon as may be; and as for the bit o' hay and
      what's on the grounds and orchard, the new comer will no doubt settle
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward, finding no eloquence of his could induce the widow to
      relinquish her resolution, took her message to the squire. Mr. Hazeldean,
      who was indeed really offended at the boy's obstinate refusal to make the
      amende honorable to Randal Leslie, at first only bestowed a hearty curse
      or two on the pride and ingratitude both of mother and son. It may be
      supposed, however, that his second thoughts were more gentle, since that
      evening, though he did not go himself to the widow, he sent his "Harry."
      Now, though Harry was sometimes austere and brusque enough on her own
      account, and in such business as might especially be transacted between
      herself and the cottagers, yet she never appeared as the delegate of her
      lord except in the capacity of a herald of peace and mediating angel. It
      was with good heart, too, that she undertook this mission, since, as we
      have seen, both mother and son were great favourites of hers. She entered
      the cottage with the friendliest beam in her bright blue eye, and it was
      with the softest tone of her frank cordial voice that she accosted the
      widow. But she was no more successful than the steward had been. The truth
      is, that I don't believe the haughtiest duke in the three kingdoms is
      really so proud as your plain English rural peasant, nor half so hard to
      propitiate and deal with when his sense of dignity is ruffled. Nor are
      there many of my own literary brethren (thin-skinned creatures though we
      are) so sensitively alive to the Public Opinion, wisely despised by Dr.
      Riccabocca, as that same peasant. He can endure a good deal of contumely
      sometimes, it is true, from his superiors (though, thank Heaven! that he
      rarely meets with unjustly); but to be looked down upon and mocked and
      pointed at by his own equals&mdash;his own little world&mdash;cuts him to
      the soul. And if you can succeed in breaking this pride and destroying
      this sensitiveness, then he is a lost being. He can never recover his
      self-esteem, and you have chucked him half-way&mdash;a stolid, inert,
      sullen victim&mdash;to the perdition of the prison or the convict-ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this stuff was the nature both of the widow and her son. Had the honey
      of Plato flowed from the tongue of Mrs. Hazeldean, it could not have
      turned into sweetness the bitter spirit upon which it descended. But Mrs.
      Hazeldean, though an excellent woman, was rather a bluff, plain-spoken
      one; and after all she had some little feeling for the son of a gentleman,
      and a decayed, fallen gentleman, who, even by Lenny's account, had been
      assailed without any intelligible provocation; nor could she, with her
      strong common-sense, attach all the importance which Mrs. Fairfield did to
      the unmannerly impertinence of a few young cubs, which she said truly,
      "would soon die away if no notice was taken of it." The widow's mind was
      made up, and Mrs. Hazeldean departed,&mdash;with much chagrin and some
      displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fairfield, however, tacitly understood that the request she had made
      was granted, and early one morning her door was found locked, the key left
      at a neighbour's to be given to the steward; and, on further inquiry, it
      was ascertained that her furniture and effects had been removed by the
      errand cart in the dead of the night. Lenny had succeeded in finding a
      cottage on the road-side, not far from the Casino; and there, with a
      joyous face, he waited to welcome his mother to breakfast, and show how he
      had spent the night in arranging her furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parson!" cried the squire, when all this news came upon him, as he was
      walking arm in arm with Mr. Dale to inspect some proposed improvement in
      the Almshouse, "this is all your fault. Why did you not go and talk to
      that brute of a boy and that dolt of a woman? You've got 'soft sawder
      enough,' as Frank calls it in his new-fashioned slang."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if I had not talked myself hoarse to both!" said the parson, in a tone
      of reproachful surprise at the accusation. "But it was in vain! O Squire,
      if you had taken my advice about the stocks,&mdash;'quieta non movere'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother!" said the squire. "I suppose I am to be held up as a tyrant, a
      Nero, a Richard the Third, or a Grand Inquisitor, merely for having things
      smart and tidy! Stocks indeed! Your friend Rickeybockey said he was never
      more comfortable in his life,&mdash;quite enjoyed sitting there. And what
      did not hurt Rickeybockey's dignity (a very gentlemanlike man he is, when
      he pleases) ought to be no such great matter to Master Leonard Fairfield.
      But 't is no use talking! What's to be done now? The woman must not
      starve; and I'm sure she can't live out of Rickeybockey's wages to Lenny,&mdash;by
      the way, I hope he don't board the boy upon his and Jackeymo's leavings: I
      hear they dine upon newts and sticklebacks, faugh! I'll tell you what,
      Parson, now I think of it, at the back of the cottage which she has taken
      there are some fields of capital land just vacant. Rickeybockey wants to
      have 'em, and sounded me as to the rent when he was at the Hall. I only
      half promised him the refusal. And he must give up four or five acres of
      the best land round the cottage to the widow&mdash;just enough for her to
      manage&mdash;and she can keep a dairy. If she want capital, I'll lend her
      some in your name,&mdash;only don't tell Stirn; and as for the rent&mdash;we'll
      talk of that when we see how she gets on, thankless, obstinate jade that
      she is! You see," added the squire, as if he felt there was some apology
      due for this generosity to an object whom he professed to consider so
      ungrateful, "her husband was a faithful servant, and so&mdash;I wish you
      would not stand there staring me out of countenance, but go down to the
      woman at once, or Stirn will have let the land to Rickeybockey, as sure as
      a gun. And hark ye, Dale, perhaps you can contrive, if the woman is so
      cursedly stiffbacked, not to say the land is mine, or that it is any
      favour I want to do her&mdash;or, in short, manage it as you can for the
      best." Still even this charitable message failed. The widow knew that the
      land was the squire's, and worth a good L3 an acre. "She thanked him
      humbly for that and all favours; but she could not afford to buy cows, and
      she did not wish to be beholden to any one for her living. And Lenny was
      well off at Mr. Rickeybockey's, and coming on wonderfully in the garden
      way, and she did not doubt she could get some washing; at all events, her
      haystack would bring in a good bit of money, and she should do nicely,
      thank their honours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing further could be done in the direct way, but the remark about the
      washing suggested some mode of indirectly benefiting the widow; and a
      little time afterwards, the sole laundress in that immediate neighbourhood
      happening to die, a hint from the squire obtained from the landlady of the
      inn opposite the Casino such custom as she had to bestow, which at times
      was not inconsiderable. And what with Lenny's wages (whatever that
      mysterious item might be), the mother and son contrived to live without
      exhibiting any of those physical signs of fast and abstinence which
      Riccabocca and his valet gratuitously afforded to the student in animal
      anatomy.

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all the wares and commodities in exchange and barter, wherein so mainly
      consists the civilization of our modern world, there is not one which is
      so carefully weighed, so accurately measured, so plumbed and gauged, so
      doled and scraped, so poured out in minima and balanced with scruples,&mdash;as
      that necessary of social commerce called "an apology"! If the chemists
      were half so careful in vending their poisons, there would be a notable
      diminution in the yearly average of victims to arsenic and oxalic acid.
      But, alas! in the matter of apology, it is not from the excess of the
      dose, but the timid, niggardly, miserly manner in which it is dispensed,
      that poor Humanity is hurried off to the Styx! How many times does a life
      depend on the exact proportions of an apology! Is it a hairbreadth too
      short to cover the scratch for which you want it? Make your will,&mdash;you
      are a dead man! A life do I say?&mdash;a hecatomb of lives! How many wars
      would have been prevented, how many thrones would be standing, dynasties
      flourishing, commonwealths brawling round a bema, or fitting out galleys
      for corn and cotton, if an inch or two more of apology had been added to
      the proffered ell! But then that plaguy, jealous, suspicious, old
      vinegar-faced Honour, and her partner Pride&mdash;as penny-wise and
      pound-foolish a she-skinflint as herself&mdash;have the monopoly of the
      article. And what with the time they lose in adjusting their spectacles,
      hunting in the precise shelf for the precise quality demanded, then
      (quality found) the haggling as to quantum,&mdash;considering whether it
      should be Apothecary's weight or Avoirdupois, or English measure or
      Flemish,&mdash;and, finally, the hullabuloo they make if the customer is
      not perfectly satisfied with the monstrous little he gets for his money, I
      don't wonder, for my part, how one loses temper and patience, and sends
      Pride, Honour, and Apology all to the devil. Aristophanes, in his comedy
      of "Peace," insinuates a beautiful allegory by only suffering that
      goddess, though in fact she is his heroine, to appear as a mute. She takes
      care never to open her lips. The shrewd Greek knew very well that she
      would cease to be Peace, if she once began to chatter. Wherefore, O
      reader, if ever you find your pump under the iron heel of another man's
      boot, Heaven grant that you may hold your tongue, and not make things past
      all endurance and forgiveness by bawling out for an apology!

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But the squire and his son, Frank, were large-hearted generous creatures
      in the article of apology, as in all things less skimpingly dealt out. And
      seeing that Leonard Fairfield would offer no plaster to Randal Leslie,
      they made amends for his stinginess by their own prodigality. The squire
      accompanied his son to Rood Hall, and none of the family choosing to be at
      home, the squire in his own hand, and from his own head, indited and
      composed an epistle which might have satisfied all the wounds which the
      dignity of the Leslies had ever received.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter of apology ended with a hearty request that Randal would come
      and spend a few days with his son. Frank's epistle was to the same
      purport, only more Etonian and less legible.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some days before Randal's replies to these epistles were received.
      The replies bore the address of a village near London; and stated that the
      writer was now reading with a tutor preparatory to entrance to Oxford, and
      could not, therefore, accept the invitation extended to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest, Randal expressed himself with good sense, though not with
      much generosity. He excused his participation in the vulgarity of such a
      conflict by a bitter, but short allusion to the obstinacy and ignorance of
      the village boor; and did not do what you, my kind reader, certainly would
      have done under similar circumstances,&mdash;namely, intercede in behalf
      of a brave and unfortunate antagonist. Most of us like a foe better after
      we have fought him,&mdash;that is, if we are the conquering party; this
      was not the case with Randal Leslie. There, so far as the Etonian was
      concerned, the matter rested. And the squire, irritated that he could not
      repair whatever wrong that young gentleman had sustained, no longer felt a
      pang of regret as he passed by Mrs. Fairfield's deserted cottage.

      Lenny Fairfield continued to give great satisfaction to his new employers,
      and to profit in many respects by the familiar kindness with which he was
      treated. Riccabocca, who valued himself on penetrating into character, had
      from the first seen that much stuff of no common quality and texture was
      to be found in the disposition and mind of the English village boy. On
      further acquaintance, he perceived that, under a child's innocent
      simplicity, there were the workings of an acuteness that required but
      development and direction. He ascertained that the pattern-boy's progress
      at the village school proceeded from something more than mechanical
      docility and readiness of comprehension. Lenny had a keen thirst for
      knowledge, and through all the disadvantages of birth and circumstance,
      there were the indications of that natural genius which converts
      disadvantages themselves into stimulants. Still, with the germs of good
      qualities lay the embryos of those which, difficult to separate, and hard
      to destroy, often mar the produce of the soil. With a remarkable and
      generous pride in self-repute, there was some stubbornness; with great
      sensibility to kindness, there was also strong reluctance to forgive
      affront.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mixed nature in an uncultivated peasant's breast interested
      Riccabocca, who, though long secluded from the commerce of mankind, still
      looked upon man as the most various and entertaining volume which
      philosophical research can explore. He soon accustomed the boy to the tone
      of a conversation generally subtle and suggestive; and Lenny's language
      and ideas became insensibly less rustic and more refined. Then Riccabocca
      selected from his library, small as it was, books that, though elementary,
      were of a higher cast than Lenny could have found within his reach at
      Hazeldean. Riccabocca knew the English language well,&mdash;better in
      grammar, construction, and genius than many a not ill-educated Englishman;
      for he had studied it with the minuteness with which a scholar studies a
      dead language, and amidst his collection he had many of the books which
      had formerly served him for that purpose. These were the first works he
      lent to Lenny. Meanwhile Jackeymo imparted to the boy many secrets in
      practical gardening and minute husbandry, for at that day farming in
      England (some favoured counties and estates excepted) was far below the
      nicety to which the art has been immemorially carried in the north of
      Italy,&mdash;where, indeed, you may travel for miles and miles as through
      a series of market-gardens; so that, all these things considered, Leonard
      Fairfield might be said to have made a change for the better. Yet, in
      truth, and looking below the surface, that might be fair matter of doubt.
      For the same reason which had induced the boy to fly his native village,
      he no longer repaired to the church of Hazeldean. The old intimate
      intercourse between him and the parson became necessarily suspended, or
      bounded to an occasional kindly visit from the latter,&mdash;visits which
      grew more rare and less familiar, as he found his former pupil in no want
      of his services, and wholly deaf to his mild entreaties to forget and
      forgive the past, and come at least to his old seat in the parish church.
      Lenny still went to church,&mdash;a church a long way off in another
      parish,&mdash;but the sermons did not do him the same good as Parson
      Dale's had done; and the clergyman, who had his own flock to attend to,
      did not condescend, as Parson Dale would have done, to explain what seemed
      obscure, and enforce what was profitable, in private talk, with that stray
      lamb from another's fold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I question much if all Dr. Riccabocca's maxims, though they were often
      very moral and generally very wise, served to expand the peasant boy's
      native good qualities, and correct his bad, half so well as the few simple
      words, not at all indebted to Machiavelli, which Leonard had once
      reverently listened to when he stood by Mark's elbow-chair, yielded up for
      the moment to the good parson, worthy to sit in it; for Mr. Dale had a
      heart in which all the fatherless of the parish found their place. Nor was
      this loss of tender, intimate, spiritual lore so counterbalanced by the
      greater facilities for purely intellectual instruction as modern
      enlightenment might presume. For, without disputing the advantage of
      knowledge in a general way, knowledge, in itself, is not friendly to
      content. Its tendency, of course, is to increase the desires, to
      dissatisfy us with what is, in order to urge progress to what may be; and
      in that progress, what unnoticed martyrs among the many must fall baffled
      and crushed by the way! To how large a number will be given desires they
      will never realize, dissatisfaction of the lot from which they will never
      rise! Allons! one is viewing the dark side of the question. It is all the
      fault of that confounded Riccabocca, who has already caused Lenny
      Fairfield to lean gloomily on his spade, and, after looking round and
      seeing no one near him, groan out querulously,&mdash;"And am I born to dig
      a potato ground?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardieu, my friend Lenny, if you live to be seventy, and ride in your
      carriage, and by the help of a dinner-pill digest a spoonful of curry, you
      may sigh to think what a relish there was in potatoes, roasted in ashes
      after you had digged them out of that ground with your own stout young
      hands. Dig on, Lenny Fairfield, dig on! Dr. Riccabocca will tell you that
      there was once an illustrious personage&mdash;[The Emperor Diocletian]&mdash;who
      made experience of two very different occupations,&mdash;one was ruling
      men, the other was planting cabbages; he thought planting cabbages much
      the pleasanter of the two!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca had secured Lenny Fairfield, and might therefore be
      considered to have ridden his hobby in the great whirligig with adroitness
      and success. But Miss Jemima was still driving round in her car, handling
      the reins, and flourishing the whip, without apparently having got an inch
      nearer to the flying form of Dr. Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, that excellent and only too susceptible spinster, with all her
      experience of the villany of man, had never conceived the wretch to be so
      thoroughly beyond the reach of redemption as when Dr. Riccabocca took his
      leave, and once more interred himself amidst the solitudes of the Casino,
      and without having made any formal renunciation of his criminal celibacy.
      For some days she shut herself up in her own chamber, and brooded with
      more than her usual gloomy satisfaction on the certainty of the
      approaching crash. Indeed, many signs of that universal calamity, which,
      while the visit of Riccabocca lasted, she had permitted herself to
      consider ambiguous, now became luminously apparent. Even the newspaper,
      which during that credulous and happy period had given half a column to
      Births and Marriages, now bore an ominously long catalogue of Deaths; so
      that it seemed as if the whole population had lost heart, and had no
      chance of repairing its daily losses. The leading article spoke, with the
      obscurity of a Pythian, of an impending CRISIS. Monstrous turnips sprouted
      out from the paragraphs devoted to General News. Cows bore calves with two
      heads, whales were stranded in the Humber, showers of frogs descended in
      the High Street of Cheltenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these symptoms of the world's decrepitude and consummation, which by
      the side of the fascinating Riccabocca might admit of some doubt as to
      their origin and cause, now, conjoined with the worst of all, namely, the
      frightfully progressive wickedness of man,&mdash;left to Miss Jemima no
      ray of hope save that afforded by the reflection that she could
      contemplate the wreck of matter without a single sentiment of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dale, however, by no means shared the despondency of her fair friend,
      and having gained access to Miss Jemima's chamber, succeeded, though not
      without difficulty, in her kindly attempts to cheer the drooping spirits
      of that female misanthropist. Nor, in her benevolent desire to speed the
      car of Miss Jemima to its hymeneal goal, was Mrs. Dale so cruel towards
      her male friend, Dr. Riccabocca, as she seemed to her husband. For Mrs.
      Dale was a woman of shrewdness and penetration, as most quick-tempered
      women are; and she knew that Miss Jemima was one of those excellent young
      ladies who are likely to value a husband in proportion to the difficulty
      of obtaining him. In fact, my readers of both sexes must often have met,
      in the course of their experience, with that peculiar sort of feminine
      disposition, which requires the warmth of the conjugal hearth to develop
      all its native good qualities; nor is it to be blamed overmuch if,
      innocently aware of this tendency in its nature, it turns towards what is
      best fitted for its growth and improvement, by laws akin to those which
      make the sunflower turn to the sun, or the willow to the stream. Ladies of
      this disposition, permanently thwarted in their affectionate bias,
      gradually languish away into intellectual inanition, or sprout out into
      those abnormal eccentricities which are classed under the general name of
      "oddity" or "character." But once admitted to their proper soil, it is
      astonishing what healthful improvement takes place,&mdash;how the poor
      heart, before starved and stinted of nourishment, throws out its suckers,
      and bursts into bloom and fruit. And thus many a belle from whom the beaux
      have stood aloof, only because the puppies think she could be had for the
      asking, they see afterwards settled down into true wife and fond mother,
      with amaze at their former disparagement, and a sigh at their blind
      hardness of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all probability Mrs. Dale took this view of the subject; and certainly,
      in addition to all the hitherto dormant virtues which would be awakened in
      Miss Jemima when fairly Mrs. Riccabocca, she counted somewhat upon the
      mere worldly advantage which such a match would bestow upon the exile. So
      respectable a connection with one of the oldest, wealthiest, and most
      popular families in the shire would in itself give him a position not to
      be despised by a poor stranger in the land; and though the interest of
      Miss Jemima's dowry might not be much, regarded in the light of English
      pounds (not Milanese lire), still it would suffice to prevent that gradual
      process of dematerialization which the lengthened diet upon minnows and
      sticklebacks had already made apparent in the fine and slow-evanishing
      form of the philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all persons convinced of the expediency of a thing, Mrs. Dale saw
      nothing wanting but opportunities to insure its success. And that these
      might be forthcoming she not only renewed with greater frequency, and more
      urgent instance than ever, her friendly invitations to Riccabocca to drink
      tea and spend the evening, but she so artfully chafed the squire on his
      sore point of hospitality, that the doctor received weekly a pressing
      solicitation to dine and sleep at the Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the Italian pished and grunted, and said Cospetto, and Per Bacco,
      and Diavolo, and tried to creep out of so much proffered courtesy. But
      like all single gentlemen, he was a little under the tyrannical influence
      of his faithful servant; and Jackeymo, though he could bear starving as
      well as his master when necessary, still, when he had the option,
      preferred roast beef and plum-pudding. Moreover, that vain and incautious
      confidence of Riccabocca touching the vast sum at his command, and with no
      heavier drawback than that of so amiable a lady as Miss Jemima&mdash;who
      had already shown him (Jackeymo) many little delicate attentions&mdash;had
      greatly whetted the cupidity which was in the servant's Italian nature,&mdash;a
      cupidity the more keen because, long debarred its legitimate exercise on
      his own mercenary interests, he carried it all to the account of his
      master's!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus tempted by his enemy and betrayed by his servant, the unfortunate
      Riccabocca fell, though with eyes not unblinded, into the hospitable
      snares extended for the destruction of his&mdash;celibacy! He went often
      to the Parsonage, often to the Hall, and by degrees the sweets of the
      social domestic life, long denied him, began to exercise their enervating
      charm upon the stoicism of our poor exile. Frank had now returned to Eton.
      An unexpected invitation had carried off Captain Higginbotham to pass a
      few weeks at Bath with a distant relation, who had lately returned from
      India, and who, as rich as Creesus, felt so estranged and solitary in his
      native isle that, when the captain "claimed kindred there," to his own
      amaze "he had his claims allowed;" while a very protracted sitting of
      parliament still delayed in London the squire's habitual visitors during
      the later summer; so that&mdash;a chasm thus made in his society&mdash;Mr.
      Hazeldean welcomed with no hollow cordiality the diversion or distraction
      he found in the foreigner's companionship. Thus, with pleasure to all
      parties, and strong hopes to the two female conspirators, the intimacy
      between the Casino and Hall rapidly thickened; but still not a word
      resembling a distinct proposal did Dr. Riccabocca breathe. And still, if
      such an idea obtruded itself on his mind, it was chased therefrom with so
      determined a Diavolo that perhaps, if not the end of the world, at least
      the end of Miss Jemima's tenure in it, might have approached and seen her
      still Miss Jemima, but for a certain letter with a foreign postmark that
      reached the doctor one Tuesday morning.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The servant saw that something had gone wrong, and, under pretence of
      syringing the orange-trees, he lingered near his master, and peered
      through the sunny leaves upon Riccabocca's melancholy brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor sighed heavily. Nor did he, as was his wont after some such
      sigh, mechanically take up that dear comforter the pipe. But though the
      tobacco-pouch lay by his side on the balustrade, and the pipe stood
      against the wall between his knees, childlike lifting up its lips to the
      customary caress, he heeded neither the one nor the other, but laid the
      letter silently on his lap, and fixed his eyes upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be bad news indeed!" thought Jackeymo, and desisted from his
      work. Approaching his master, he took up the pipe and the tobacco-pouch,
      and filled the bowl slowly, glancing all the while towards that dark
      musing face on which, when abandoned by the expression of intellectual
      vivacity or the exquisite smile of Italian courtesy, the deep downward
      lines revealed the characters of sorrow. Jackeymo did not venture to
      speak; but the continued silence of his master disturbed him much. He laid
      that peculiar tinder which your smokers use upon the steel, and struck the
      spark,&mdash;still not a word, nor did Riccabocca stretch forth his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew him in this taking before," thought Jackeymo; and delicately
      he insinuated the neck of the pipe into the nerveless fingers of the band
      that lay supine on those quiet knees. The pipe fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo crossed himself, and began praying to his sainted namesake with
      great fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor rose slowly, and as if with effort; he walked once or twice to
      and fro the terrace; and then he halted abruptly and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blessed Monsignore San Giacomo, I knew thou wouldst hear me!" cried the
      servant; and he raised his master's hand to his lips, then abruptly turned
      away and wiped his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend," repeated Riccabocca, and this time with a tremulous emphasis,
      and in the softest tone of a voice never wholly without the music of the
      sweet South, "I would talk to thee of my child."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "The letter, then, relates to the signorina. She is well?"
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Yes, she is well now. She is in our native Italy." Jackeymo raised his
      eyes involuntarily towards the orange-trees, and the morning breeze swept
      by and bore to him the odour of their blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those are sweet even here, with care," said he, pointing to the trees. "I
      think I have said that before to the padrone."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Riccabocca was now looking again at the letter, and did not notice
      either the gesture or the remark of his servant. "My aunt is no more!"
      said he, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will pray for her soul!" answered Jackeymo, solemnly. "But she was
      very old, and had been a long time ailing. Let it not grieve the padrone
      too keenly: at that age, and with those infirmities, death comes as a
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace be to her dust!" returned the Italian. "If she had her faults, be
      they now forgotten forever; and in the hour of my danger and distress she
      sheltered my infant! That shelter is destroyed. This letter is from the
      priest, her confessor. And the home of which my child is bereaved falls to
      the inheritance of my enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Traitor!" muttered Jackeymo; and his right hand seemed to feel for the
      weapon which the Italians of lower rank often openly wear in their
      girdles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The priest," resumed Riccabocca, calmly, "has rightly judged in removing
      my child as a guest from the house in which that traitor enters as lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where is the signorina?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the poor priest. See, Giacomo, here, here&mdash;this is her
      handwriting at the end of the letter,&mdash;the first lines she ever yet
      traced to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo took off his hat, and looked reverently on the large characters
      of a child's writing. But large as they were, they seemed indistinct, for
      the paper was blistered with the child's tears; and on the place where
      they had not fallen, there was a round fresh moist stain of the tear that
      had dropped from the lids of the father. Riccabocca renewed, "The priest
      recommends a convent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the devil with the priest!" cried the servant; then crossing himself
      rapidly, he added, "I did not mean that, Monsignore San Giacomo,&mdash;forgive
      me! But your Excellency does not think of making a nun of his only child!"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [The title of Excellency does not, in Italian, necessarily express
   any exalted rank, but is often given by servants to their masters.]
</pre>
    <p>
      "And yet why not?" said Riccabocca, mournfully; "what can I give her in
      the world? Is the land of the stranger a better refuge than the home of
      peace in her native clime?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the land of the stranger beats her father's heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if that beat were stilled, what then? Ill fares the life that a
      single death can bereave of all. In a convent at least (and the priest's
      influence can obtain her that asylum amongst her equals and amidst her
      sex) she is safe from trial and from penury&mdash;to her grave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Penury! Just see how rich we shall be when we take those fields at
      Michaelmas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pazzie!"&mdash;[Follies]&mdash;said Riccabocca, listlessly. "Are these
      suns more serene than ours, or the soil more fertile? Yet in our own
      Italy, saith the proverb, 'He who sows land reaps more care than corn.' It
      were different," continued the father, after a pause, and in a more
      resolute tone, "if I had some independence, however small, to count on,&mdash;nay,
      if among all my tribe of dainty relatives there were but one female who
      would accompany Violante to the exile's hearth,&mdash;Ishmael had his
      Hagar. But how can we two rough-bearded men provide for all the nameless
      wants and cares of a frail female child? And she has been so delicately
      reared,&mdash;the woman-child needs the fostering hand and tender eye of a
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with a word," said Jackeymo, resolutely, "the padrone might secure to
      his child all that he needs to save her from the sepulchre of a convent;
      and ere the autumn leaves fall, she might be sitting on his knee. Padrone,
      do not think that you can conceal from me the truth, that you love your
      child better than all things in the world,&mdash;now the Patria is as dead
      to you as the dust of your fathers,&mdash;and your heart-strings would
      crack with the effort to tear her from them, and consign her to a convent.
      Padrone, never again to hear her voice, never again to see her face! Those
      little arms that twined round your neck that dark night, when we fled fast
      for life and freedom, and you said, as you felt their clasp, 'Friend, all
      is not yet lost.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giacomo!" exclaimed the father, reproachfully, and his voice seemed to
      choke him. Riccabocca turned away, and walked restlessly to and fro the
      terrace; then, lifting his arms with a wild gesture, as he still continued
      his long irregular strides, he muttered, "Yes, Heaven is my witness that I
      could have borne reverse and banishment without a murmur, had I permitted
      myself that young partner in exile and privation. Heaven is my witness
      that, if I hesitate now, it is because I would not listen to my own
      selfish heart. Yet never, never to see her again,&mdash;my child! And it
      was but as the infant that I beheld her! O friend, friend!" (and, stopping
      short with a burst of uncontrollable emotion, he bowed his head upon his
      servant's shoulder), "thou knowest what I have endured and suffered at my
      hearth, as in my country; the wrong, the perfidy, the&mdash;the&mdash;"
      His voice again failed him; he clung to his servant's breast, and his
      whole frame shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your child, the innocent one&mdash;think now only of her!" faltered
      Giacomo, struggling with his own sobs. "True, only of her," replied the
      exile, raising his face, "only of her. Put aside thy thoughts for thyself,
      friend,&mdash;counsel me. If I were to send for Violante, and if,
      transplanted to these keen airs, she drooped and died&mdash;Look, look,
      the priest says that she needs such tender care; or if I myself were
      summoned from the world, to leave her in it alone, friendless, homeless,
      breadless perhaps, at the age of woman's sharpest trial against
      temptation, would she not live to mourn the cruel egotism that closed on
      her infant innocence the gates of the House of God?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo was appalled by this appeal; and indeed Riccabocca had never
      before thus reverently spoken of the cloister. In his hours of philosophy,
      he was wont to sneer at monks and nuns, priesthood and superstition. But
      now, in that hour of emotion, the Old Religion reclaimed her empire; and
      the sceptical world-wise man, thinking only of his child, spoke and felt
      with a child's simple faith.

      "But again I say," murmured Jackeymo, scarce audibly, and after a long
      silence, "if the padrone would make up his mind&mdash;to marry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He expected that his master would start up in his customary indignation at
      such a suggestion,&mdash;nay, he might not have been sorry so to have
      changed the current of feeling; but the poor Italian only winced slightly,
      and mildly withdrawing himself from his servant's supporting arm, again
      paced the terrace, but this time quietly and in silence. A quarter of an
      hour thus passed. "Give me the pipe," said Dr. Riccabocca, passing into
      the belvidere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo again struck the spark, and, wonderfully relieved at the
      padrone's return to the habitual adviser, mentally besought his sainted
      namesake to bestow a double portion of soothing wisdom on the benignant
      influences of the weed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca had been some little time in the solitude of the belvidere,
      when Lenny Fairfield, not knowing that his employer was therein, entered
      to lay down a book which the doctor had lent him, with injunctions to
      leave it on a certain table when done with. Riccabocca looked up at the
      sound of the young peasant's step.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your honour's pardon, I did not know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind: lay the book there. I wish to speak with you. You look well,
      my child: this air agrees with you as well as that of Hazeldean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet it is higher ground,&mdash;more exposed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That can hardly be, sir," said Lenny; "there are many plants grow here
      which don't flourish at the squire's. The hill yonder keeps off the east
      wind, and the place lays to the south."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lies, not lays, Lenny. What are the principal complaints in these parts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean what maladies, what diseases?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard tell of any, sir, except the rheumatism."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No low fevers, no consumption?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never heard of them, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca drew a long breath, as if relieved. "That seems a very kind
      family at the Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to say against it," answered Lenny, bluntly. "I have not
      been treated justly. But as that book says, sir, 'It is not every one who
      comes into the world with a silver spoon in his mouth.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Little thought the doctor that those wise maxims may leave sore thoughts
      behind them! He was too occupied with the subject most at his own heart to
      think then of what was in Lenny Fairfield's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; a kind, English domestic family. Did you see much of Miss
      Hazeldean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so much as of the Lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she liked in the village, think you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Jemima? Yes. She never did harm. Her little dog bit me once,&mdash;she
      did not ask me to beg its pardon, she asked mine! She's a very nice young
      lady; the girls say she is very affable; and," added Lenny, with a smile,
      "there are always more weddings going on when she is down at the Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Riccabocca. Then, after a long whiff, "Did you ever see her
      play with the little children? Is she fond of children, do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord, sir, you guess everything! She's never so pleased as when she's
      playing with the babies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" grunted Riccabocca. "Babies! well, that's woman-like. I don't
      mean exactly babies, but when they're older,&mdash;little girls?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, Sir, I dare say; but," said Lenny, primly, "I never as yet kept
      company with the little girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, Lenny; be equally discreet all your life. Mrs. Dale is very
      intimate with Miss Hazeldean,&mdash;more than with the squire's lady. Why
      is that, think you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," said Leonard, shrewdly, "Mrs. Dale has her little tempers,
      though she's a very good lady; and Madame Hazeldean is rather high, and
      has a spirit. But Miss Jemima is so soft: any one could live with Miss
      Jemima, as Joe and the servants say at the Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! get my hat out of the parlour, and&mdash;just bring a
      clothes-brush, Lenny. A fine sunny day for a walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      After this most mean and dishonourable inquisition into the character and
      popular repute of Miss Hazeldean, Signor Riccabocca seemed as much cheered
      up and elated as if he had committed some very noble action; and he walked
      forth in the direction of the Hall with a far lighter and livelier step
      than that with which he had paced the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsignore San Giacomo, by thy help and the pipe's, the padrone shall
      have his child!" muttered the servant, looking up from the garden.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yet Dr. Riccabocca was not rash. The man who wants his wedding-garment to
      fit him must allow plenty of time for the measure. But from that day, the
      Italian notably changed his manner towards Miss Hazeldean. He ceased that
      profusion of compliment in which he had hitherto carried off in safety all
      serious meaning. For indeed the doctor considered that compliments to a
      single gentleman were what the inky liquid it dispenses is to the
      cuttle-fish, that by obscuring the water sails away from its enemy.
      Neither did he, as before, avoid prolonged conversations with the young
      lady, and contrive to escape from all solitary rambles by her side. On the
      contrary, he now sought every occasion to be in her society; and entirely
      dropping the language of gallantry, he assumed something of the earnest
      tone of friendship. He bent down his intellect to examine and plumb her
      own. To use a very homely simile, he blew away that froth which there is
      on the surface of mere acquaintanceships, especially with the opposite
      sex; and which, while it lasts, scarce allows you to distinguish between
      small beer and double X. Apparently Dr. Riccabocca was satisfied with his
      scrutiny,&mdash;at all events under that froth there was no taste of
      bitter. The Italian might not find any great strength of intellect in Miss
      Jemima, but he found that, disentangled from many little whims and
      foibles,&mdash;which he had himself the sense to perceive were harmless
      enough if they lasted, and not so absolutely constitutional but what they
      might be removed by a tender hand,&mdash;Miss Hazeldean had quite enough
      sense to comprehend the plain duties of married life; and if the sense
      could fail, it found a substitute in good old homely English principles,
      and the instincts of amiable, kindly feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not how it is, but your very clever man never seems to care so much
      as your less gifted mortals for cleverness in his helpmate. Your scholars
      and poets and ministers of state are more often than not found assorted
      with exceedingly humdrum, good sort of women, and apparently like them all
      the better for their deficiencies. Just see how happily Racine lived with
      his wife, and what an angel he thought her, and yet she had never read his
      plays. Certainly Goethe never troubled the lady who called him "Mr. Privy
      Councillor" with whims about "monads," and speculations on colour, nor
      those stiff metaphysical problems on which one breaks one's shins in the
      Second Past of the "Faust." Probably it may be that such great geniuses&mdash;knowing
      that, as compared with themselves, there is little difference between your
      clever woman and your humdrum woman&mdash;merge at once all minor
      distinctions, relinquish all attempts at sympathy in hard intellectual
      pursuits, and are quite satisfied to establish that tie which, after all,
      best resists wear and tear,&mdash;namely, the tough household bond between
      one human heart and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, this, I suspect, was the reasoning of Dr. Riccabocca, when
      one morning, after a long walk with Miss Hazeldean, he muttered to
      himself,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               "Duro con duro
          Non fete mai buon muro,"&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      which may bear the paraphrase, "Bricks without mortar would make a very
      bad wall." There was quite enough in Miss Jemima's disposition to make
      excellent mortar: the doctor took the bricks to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his examination was concluded, our philosopher symbolically evinced
      the result he had arrived at by a very simple proceeding on his part,
      which would have puzzled you greatly if you had not paused, and meditated
      thereon, till you saw all that it implied. Dr. Riccabocca, took of his
      spectacles! He wiped them carefully, put them into their shagreen case,
      and locked them in his bureau,&mdash;that is to say, he left off wearing
      his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will observe that there was a wonderful depth of meaning in that
      critical symptom, whether it be regarded as a sign outward, positive, and
      explicit, or a sign metaphysical, mystical, and esoteric. For, as to the
      last, it denoted that the task of the spectacles was over; that, when a
      philosopher has made up his mind to marry, it is better henceforth to be
      shortsighted&mdash;nay, even somewhat purblind&mdash;than to be always
      scrutinizing the domestic felicity, to which he is about to resign
      himself, through a pair of cold, unillusory barnacles. As for the things
      beyond the hearth, if he cannot see without spectacles, is he not about to
      ally to his own defective vision a good sharp pair of eyes, never at fault
      where his interests are concerned? On the other hand, regarded positively,
      categorically, and explicitly, Dr. Roccabocca, by laying aside those
      spectacles, signified that he was about to commence that happy initiation
      of courtship when every man, be he ever so much a philosopher, wishes to
      look as young and as handsome as time and nature will allow. Vain task to
      speed the soft language of the eyes through the medium of those glassy
      interpreters! I remember, for my own part, that once, on a visit to the
      town of Adelaide, I&mdash;Pisistratus Caxton&mdash;was in great danger of
      falling in love,&mdash;with a young lady, too, who would have brought me a
      very good fortune,&mdash;when she suddenly produced from her reticule a
      very neat pair of No. 4, set in tortoiseshell, and fixing upon me their
      Gorgon gaze, froze the astonished Cupid into stone! And I hold it a great
      proof of the wisdom of Riccabocca, and of his vast experience in mankind,
      that he was not above the consideration of what your pseudo-sages would
      have regarded as foppish and ridiculous trifles. It argued all the better
      for that happiness which is our being's end and aim that in condescending
      to play the lover, he put those unbecoming petrifiers under lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      And certainly, now the spectacles were abandoned, it was impossible to
      deny that the Italian had remarkably handsome eyes. Even through the
      spectacles, or lifted a little above them, they were always bright and
      expressive; but without those adjuncts, the blaze was softer and more
      tempered: they had that look which the French call veloute, or velvety;
      and he appeared altogether ten years younger. If our Ulysses, thus
      rejuvenated by his Minerva, has not fully made up his mind to make a
      Penelope of Miss Jemima, all I can say is, that he is worse than
      Polyphemus, who was only an Anthropophagos,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He preys upon the weaker sex, and is a Gynopophagite!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "And you commission me, then, to speak to our dear Jemima?" said Mrs.
      Dale, joyfully, and without any bitterness whatever in that "dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Nay, before speaking to Miss Hazeldean, it would
      surely be proper to know how far my addresses would be acceptable to the
      family."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. RICCAROCCA.&mdash;"The squire is of course the head of the family."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (absent and distraite).&mdash;"The squire&mdash;yes, very true&mdash;quite
      proper." (Then, looking up, and with naivete) "Can you believe me? I never
      thought of the squire. And he is such an odd man, and has so many English
      prejudices, that really&mdash;dear me, how vexatious that it should never
      once have occurred to me that Mr. Hazeldean had a voice in the matter!
      Indeed, the relationship is so distant, it is not like being her father;
      and Jemima is of age, and can do as she pleases; and&mdash;but, as you
      say, it is quite proper that he should be consulted as the head of the
      family."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. RICCASOCCA.&mdash;"And you think that the Squire of Hazeldean might
      reject my alliance! Pshaw! that's a grand word indeed,&mdash;I mean, that
      he might object very reasonably to his cousin's marriage with a foreigner,
      of whom he can know nothing, except that which in all countries is
      disreputable, and is said in this to be criminal,&mdash;poverty."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (kindly)&mdash;"You misjudge us poor English people, and you
      wrong the squire, Heaven bless him! for we were poor enough when he
      singled out my husband from a hundred for the minister of his parish, for
      his neighbour and his friend. I will speak to him fearlessly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"And frankly. And now I have used that word, let me
      go on with the confession which your kindly readiness, my fair friend,
      somewhat interrupted. I said that if I might presume to think my addresses
      would be acceptable to Miss Hazeldean and her family, I was too sensible
      of her amiable qualities not to&mdash;not to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (with demure archness).&mdash;"Not to be the happiest of men,&mdash;that's
      the customary English phrase, Doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA (gallantly).&mdash;"There cannot be a better. But," continued
      he, seriously, "I wish it first to be understood that I have&mdash;been
      married before!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (astonished).&mdash;"Married before!"
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"And that I have an only child, dear to me,&mdash;inexpressibly
      dear. That child, a daughter, has hitherto lived abroad; circumstances now
      render it desirable that she should make her home with me; and I own
      fairly that nothing has so attached me to Miss Hazeldean, nor so induced
      my desire for our matrimonial connection, as my belief that she has the
      heart and the temper to become a kind mother to my little one."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (with feeling and warmth).&mdash;"You judge her rightly there."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Now, in pecuniary matters, as you may conjecture from
      my mode of life, I have nothing to offer to Miss Hazeldean correspondent
      with her own fortune, whatever that may be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"That difficulty is obviated by settling Miss Hazeldean's
      fortune on herself, which is customary in such cases."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca's face lengthened. "And my child, then?" said he,
      feelingly. There was something in that appeal so alien from all sordid and
      merely personal mercenary motives, that Mrs. Dale could not have had the
      heart to make the very rational suggestion, "But that child is not
      Jemima's, and you may have children by her."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was touched, and replied hesitatingly, "But from what you and Jemima
      may jointly possess you can save something annually,&mdash;you can insure
      your life for your child. We did so when our poor child whom we lost was
      born" (the tears rushed into Mrs. Dale's eyes); "and I fear that Charles
      still insures his life for my sake, though Heaven knows that&mdash;that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears burst out. That little heart, quick and petulant though it was,
      had not a fibre of the elastic muscular tissues which are mercifully
      bestowed on the hearts of predestined widows. Dr. Riccabocca could not
      pursue the subject of life insurances further. But the idea&mdash;which
      had never occurred to the foreigner before, though so familiar with us
      English people when only possessed of a life income&mdash;pleased him
      greatly. I will do him the justice to say that he preferred it to the
      thought of actually appropriating to himself and to his child a portion of
      Miss Hazeldean's dower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards he took his leave, and Mrs. Dale hastened to seek her
      husband in his study, inform him of the success of her matrimonial scheme,
      and consult him as to the chance of the squire's acquiescence therein.
      "You see," said she, hesitatingly, "though the squire might be glad to see
      Jemima married to some Englishman, yet if he asks who and what is this Dr.
      Riccabocca, how am I to answer him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should have thought of that before," said Mr. Dale, with unwonted
      asperity; "and, indeed, if I had ever believed anything serious could come
      out of what seemed to me so absurd, I should long since have requested you
      not to interfere in such matters. Good heavens!" continued the parson,
      changing colour, "if we should have assisted, underhand as it were, to
      introduce into the family of a man to whom we owe so much a connection
      that he would dislike, how base we should be, how ungrateful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Dale was frightened by this speech, and still more by her
      husband's consternation and displeasure. To do Mrs. Dale justice, whenever
      her mild partner was really either grieved or offended, her little temper
      vanished,&mdash;she became as meek as a lamb. As soon as she recovered the
      first shock she experienced, she hastened to dissipate the parson's
      apprehensions. She assured him that she was convinced that, if the squire
      disapproved of Riccabocca's pretensions, the Italian would withdraw them
      at once, and Miss Hazeldean would never know of his proposals. Therefore,
      in that case, no harm would be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      This assurance, coinciding with Mr. Dale's convictions as to Riccabocca's
      scruples on the point of honour, tended much to compose the good man; and
      if he did not, as my reader of the gentler sex would expect from him, feel
      alarm lest Miss Jemima's affections should have been irretrievably
      engaged, and her happiness thus put in jeopardy by the squire's refusal,
      it was not that the parson wanted tenderness of heart, but experience in
      womankind; and he believed, very erroneously, that Miss Jemima Hazeldean
      was not one upon whom a disappointment of that kind would produce a
      lasting impression. Therefore Mr. Dale, after a pause of consideration,
      said kindly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't vex yourself,&mdash;and I was to blame quite as much as you.
      But, indeed, I should have thought it easier for the squire to have
      transplanted one of his tall cedars into his kitchen-garden than for you
      to inveigle Dr. Riccabocca into matrimonial intentions. But a man who
      could voluntarily put himself into the parish stocks for the sake of
      experiment must be capable of anything! However, I think it better that I,
      rather than yourself, should speak to the squire, and I will go at once."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The parson put on the shovel-hat, which&mdash;conjoined with other details
      in his dress peculiarly clerical, and already, even then, beginning to be
      out of fashion with Churchmen&mdash;had served to fix upon him
      emphatically the dignified but antiquated style and cognomen of "Parson;"
      and took his way towards the Home Farm, at which he expected to find the
      squire. But he had scarcely entered upon the village green when he beheld
      Mr. Hazeldean, leaning both hands on his stick, and gazing intently upon
      the parish stocks. Now, sorry am I to say that, ever since the Hegira of
      Lenny and his mother, the Anti-Stockian and Revolutionary spirit in
      Hazeldean, which the memorable homily of our parson had a while averted or
      suspended, had broken forth afresh. For though while Lenny was present to
      be mowed and jeered at, there had been no pity for him, yet no sooner was
      he removed from the scene of trial than a universal compassion for the
      barbarous usage he had received produced what is called "the reaction of
      public opinion." Not that those who had mowed and jeered repented them of
      their mockery, or considered themselves in the slightest degree the cause
      of his expatriation. No; they, with the rest of the villagers, laid all
      the blame upon the stocks. It was not to be expected that a lad of such
      exemplary character could be thrust into that place of ignominy, and not
      be sensible to the affront. And who, in the whole village, was safe, if
      such goings-on and puttings-in were to be tolerated in silence, and at the
      expense of the very best and quietest lad the village had ever known?
      Thus, a few days after the widow's departure, the stocks was again the
      object of midnight desecration: it was bedaubed and bescratched, it was
      hacked and hewed, it was scrawled over with pithy lamentations for Lenny,
      and laconic execrations on tyrants. Night after night new inscriptions
      appeared, testifying the sarcastic wit and the vindictive sentiment of the
      parish. And perhaps the stocks was only spared from axe and bonfire by the
      convenience it afforded to the malice of the disaffected: it became the
      Pasquin of Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      As disaffection naturally produces a correspondent vigour in authority, so
      affairs had been lately administered with greater severity than had been
      hitherto wont in the easy rule of the squire and his predecessors.
      Suspected persons were naturally marked out by Mr. Stirn, and reported to
      his employer, who, too proud or too pained to charge them openly with
      ingratitude, at first only passed them by in his walks with a silent and
      stiff inclination of his head; and afterwards, gradually yielding to the
      baleful influence of Stirn, the squire grumbled forth "that he did not see
      why he should be always putting himself out of his way to show kindness to
      those who made such a return. There ought to be a difference between the
      good and the bad." Encouraged by this admission, Stirn had conducted
      himself towards the suspected parties, and their whole kith and kin, with
      the iron-handed justice that belonged to his character. For some, habitual
      donations of milk from the dairy and vegetables from the gardens were
      surlily suspended; others were informed that their pigs were always
      trespassing on the woods in search of acorns, or that they were violating
      the Game Laws in keeping lurchers. A beer-house, popular in the
      neighbourhood, but of late resorted to over-much by the grievance-mongers
      (and no wonder, since they had become the popular party), was threatened
      with an application to the magistrates for the withdrawal of its license.
      Sundry old women, whose grandsons were notoriously ill-disposed towards
      the stocks, were interdicted from gathering dead sticks under the avenues,
      on pretence that they broke down the live boughs; and, what was more
      obnoxious to the younger members of the parish than most other retaliatory
      measures, three chestnut-trees, one walnut, and two cherry-trees, standing
      at the bottom of the Park, and which had, from time immemorial, been given
      up to the youth of Hazeldean, were now solemnly placed under the general
      defence of "private property." And the crier had announced that,
      henceforth, all depredators on the fruit trees in Copse Hollow would be
      punished with the utmost rigour of the law. Stirn, indeed, recommended
      much more stringent proceedings than all these indications of a change of
      policy, which, he averred, would soon bring the parish to its senses,&mdash;such
      as discontinuing many little jobs of unprofitable work that employed the
      surplus labour of the village. But there the squire, falling into the
      department and under the benigner influence of his Harry, was as yet not
      properly hardened. When it came to a question that affected the absolute
      quantity of loaves to be consumed by the graceless mouths that fed upon
      him, the milk of human kindness&mdash;with which Providence has so
      bountifully supplied that class of the mammalia called the "Bucolic," and
      of which our squire had an extra "yield"&mdash;burst forth, and washed
      away all the indignation of the harsher Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still your policy of half-measures, which irritates without crushing its
      victims, which flaps an exasperated wasp-nest with a silk
      pocket-handkerchief, instead of blowing it up with a match and train, is
      rarely successful; and after three or four other and much guiltier victims
      than Lenny had been incarcerated in the stocks, the parish of Hazeldean
      was ripe for any enormity. Pestilent Jacobinical tracts, conceived and
      composed in the sinks of manufacturing towns, found their way into the
      popular beer-house,&mdash;Heaven knows how, though the tinker was
      suspected of being the disseminator by all but Stirn, who still, in a
      whisper, accused the Papishers. And, finally, there appeared amongst the other
      graphic embellishments which the poor stocks had received, the rude
      gravure of a gentleman in a broad-brimmed hat and top-boots, suspended
      from a gibbet, with the inscription beneath, "A warnin to hall tirans&mdash;mind
      your hi!&mdash;sighnde Captin sTraw."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon this significant and emblematic portraiture that the squire
      was gazing when the parson joined him. "Well, Parson," said Mr. Hazeldean,
      with a smile which he meant to be pleasant and easy, but which was
      exceedingly bitter and grim, "I wish you joy of your flock,&mdash;you see
      they have just hanged me in effigy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson stared, and though greatly shocked, smothered his emotion; and
      attempted, with the wisdom of the serpent and the mildness of the dove, to
      find another original for the effigy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very bad," quoth he, "but not so bad as all that, Squire; that's
      not the shape of your bat. It is evidently meant for Mr. Stirn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?" said the squire, softened. "Yet the top-boots&mdash;Stirn
      never wears top-boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more do you, except in the hunting-field. If you look again, those are
      not tops, they are leggings,&mdash;Stirn wears leggings. Besides, that
      flourish, which is meant for a nose, is a kind of hook, like Stirn's;
      whereas your nose&mdash;though by no means a snub&mdash;rather turns up
      than not, as the Apollo's does, according to the plaster cast in
      Riccabocca's parlour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Stirn!" said the squire, in a tone that evinced complacency, not
      unmingled with compassion, "that's what a man gets in this world by being
      a faithful servant, and doing his duty with zeal for his employer. But you
      see things have come to a strange pass, and the question now is, what
      course to pursue. The miscreants hitherto have defied all vigilance, and
      Stirn recommends the employment of a regular nightwatch, with a lanthorn
      and bludgeon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may protect the stocks certainly; but will it keep those detestable
      tracts out of the beer-house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall shut the beer-house up the next sessions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tracts will break out elsewhere,&mdash;the humour's in the blood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've half a mind to run off to Brighton or Leamingtongood hunting at
      Leamington&mdash;for a year, just to let the rogues see how they can get
      on without me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire's lip trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Hazeldean," said the parson, taking his friend's hand, "I
      don't want to parade my superior wisdom; but, if you had taken my advice,
      'quieta non movere!' Was there ever a parish so peaceable as this, or a
      country gentleman so beloved as you were, before you undertook the task
      which has dethroned kings and ruined States,&mdash;that of wantonly
      meddling with antiquity, whether for the purpose of uncalled-for repairs,
      or the revival of obsolete uses."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this rebuke, the squire did not manifest his constitutional tendencies
      to choler; but he replied almost meekly, "If it were to do again, faith, I
      would leave the parish to the enjoyment of the shabbiest pair of stocks
      that ever disgraced a village. Certainly I meant it for the best,&mdash;an
      ornament to the green; however, now the stocks is rebuilt, the stocks must
      be supported. Will Hazeldean is not the man to give way to a set of
      thankless rapscallions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said the parson, "that you will allow that the House of Tudor,
      whatever its faults, was a determined, resolute dynasty enough,&mdash;high-hearted
      and strong-headed. A Tudor would never have fallen into the same
      calamities as the poor Stuart did!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the plague has the House of Tudor got to do with my stocks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great deal. Henry VIII. found a subsidy so unpopular that he gave it
      up; and the people, in return, allowed him to cut off as many heads as he
      pleased, besides those in his own family. Good Queen Bess, who, I know, is
      your idol in history&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure!&mdash;she knighted my ancestor at Tilbury Fort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Queen Bess struggled hard to maintain a certain monopoly; she saw it
      would not do, and she surrendered it with that frank heartiness which
      becomes a sovereign, and makes surrender a grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! and you would have me give up the stocks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would much rather the stocks had remained as it was before you touched
      it; but, as it is, if you could find a good plausible pretext&mdash;and
      there is an excellent one at hand,&mdash;the sternest kings open prisons,
      and grant favours, upon joyful occasions. Now a marriage in the royal
      family is of course a joyful occasion! and so it should be in that of the
      King of Hazeldean." Admire that artful turn in the parson's eloquence!&mdash;it
      was worthy of Riccabocca himself. Indeed, Mr. Dale had profited much by
      his companionship with that Machiavellian intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A marriage,&mdash;yes; but Frank has only just got into coattails!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not allude to Frank, but to your cousin Jemima!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The squire staggered as if the breath had been knocked out of him, and,
      for want of a better seat, sat down on the stocks. All the female heads in
      the neighbouring cottages peered, themselves unseen, through the
      casements. What could the squire be about? What new mischief did he
      meditate? Did he mean to fortify the stocks? Old Gaffer Solomons, who had
      an indefinite idea of the lawful power of squires, and who had been for
      the last ten minutes at watch on his threshold, shook his head and said,
      "Them as a cut out the mon a hanging, as a put it in the squire's head!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put what?" asked his grand-daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gallus!" answered Solomons,&mdash;"he be a going to have it hung from
      the great elfin-tree. And the parson, good mon, is a quoting Scripter agin
      it; you see he's a taking off his gloves, and a putting his two han's
      together, as he do when he pray for the sick, Jeany."
    </p>
    <p>
      That description of the parson's mien and manner, which with his usual
      niceness of observation, Gaffer Solomons thus sketched off, will convey to
      you some idea of the earnestness with which the parson pleaded the cause
      he had undertaken to advocate. He dwelt much upon the sense of propriety
      which the foreigner had evinced in requesting that the squire might be
      consulted before any formal communication to his cousin; and he repeated
      Mrs. Dale's assurance, that such were Riccabocca's high standard of honour
      and belief in the sacred rights of hospitality, that, if the squire
      withheld his consent to his proposals, the parson was convinced that the
      Italian would instantly retract them. Now, considering that Miss Hazeldean
      was, to say the least, come to years of discretion, and the squire had
      long since placed her property entirely at her own disposal, Mr. Hazeldean
      was forced to acquiesce in the parson's corollary remark, "That this was a
      delicacy which could not be expected from every English pretender to the
      lady's hand." Seeing that he had so far cleared the ground, the parson
      went on to intimate, though with great tact, that since Miss Jemima would
      probably marry sooner or later (and, indeed, that the squire could not
      wish to prevent her), it might be better for all parties concerned that it
      should be with some one who, though a foreigner, was settled in the
      neighbourhood, and of whose character what was known was certainly
      favourable, rather than run the hazard of her being married for her money
      by some adventurer, or Irish fortune-hunter, at the watering-places she
      yearly visited. Then he touched lightly on Riccabocca's agreeable and
      companionable qualities; and concluded with a skilful peroration upon the
      excellent occasion the wedding would afford to reconcile Hall and parish,
      by making a voluntary holocaust of the stocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he concluded, the squire's brow, before thoughtful, though not sullen,
      cleared up benignly. To say truth, the squire was dying to get rid of the
      stocks, if he could but do so handsomely and with dignity; and had all the
      stars in the astrological horoscope conjoined together to give Miss Jemima
      "assurance of a husband," they could not so have served her with the
      squire as that conjunction between the altar and the stocks which the
      parson had effected!
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when Mr. Dale had come to an end, the squire replied, with
      great placidity and good sense, "That Mr. Rickeybockey had behaved very
      much like a gentleman, and that he was very much obliged to him; that he
      [the squire] had no right to interfere in the matter, further than with
      his advice; that Jemima was old enough to choose for herself, and that, as
      the parson had implied, after all she might go farther and fare worse,&mdash;indeed,
      the farther she went (that is, the longer she waited) the worse she was
      likely to fare. I own, for my part," continued the squire, "that though I
      like Rickeybockey very much, I never suspected that Jemima was caught with
      his long face; but there's no accounting for tastes. My Harry, indeed, was
      more shrewd, and gave me many a hint, for which I only laughed at her.
      Still I ought to have thought it looked queer when Mounseer took to
      disguising himself by leaving off his glasses, ha, ha! I wonder what Harry
      will say; let's go and talk to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson, rejoiced at this easy way of taking the matter, hooked his arm
      into the squire's, and they walked amicably towards the Hall. But on
      coming first into the gardens they found Mrs. Hazeldean herself, clipping
      dead leaves or fading flowers from her rose-trees. The squire stole slyly
      behind her, and startled her in her turn by putting his arm round her
      waist, and saluting her smooth cheek with one of his hearty kisses; which,
      by the way, from some association of ideas, was a conjugal freedom that he
      usually indulged whenever a wedding was going on in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie, William!" said Mrs. Hazeldean, coyly, and blushing as she saw the
      parson. "Well, who's going to be married now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! was there ever such a woman?&mdash;she's guessed it!" cried the
      squire, in great admiration. "Tell her all about it, Parson."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hazeldean, as the reader may suppose, showed much less surprise than
      her husband had done; but she took the news graciously, and made much the
      same answer as that which had occurred to the squire, only with somewhat
      more qualification and reserve. "Signor Riccabocca had behaved very
      handsomely; and though a daughter of the Hazeldeans of Hazeldean might
      expect a much better marriage in a worldly point of view, yet as the lady
      in question had deferred finding one so long, it would be equally idle and
      impertinent now to quarrel with her choice,&mdash;if indeed she should
      decide on accepting Signor Riccabocca. As for fortune, that was a
      consideration for the two contracting parties. Still, it ought, to be
      pointed out to Miss Jemima that the interest of her fortune would afford
      but a very small income. That Dr. Riccabocca was a widower was another
      matter for deliberation; and it seemed rather suspicious that he should
      have been hitherto so close upon all matters connected with his former
      life. Certainly his manners were in his favour, and as long as he was
      merely an acquaintance, and at most a tenant, no one had a right to
      institute inquiries of a strictly private nature; but that, when he was
      about to marry a Hazeldean of Hazeldean, it became the squire at least to
      know a little more about him,&mdash;who and what he was. Why did he leave
      his own country? English people went abroad to save: no foreigner would
      choose England as a country in which to save money! She supposed that a
      foreign doctor was no very great things; probably he had been a professor
      in some Italian university. At all events, if the squire interfered at
      all, it was on such points that he should request information."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My clear madam," said the parson, "what you say is extremely just. As to
      the causes which have induced our friend to expatriate himself, I think we
      need not look far for them. He is evidently one of the many Italian
      refugees whom political disturbances have driven to a land of which it is
      the boast to receive all exiles of whatever party. For his respectability
      of birth and family he certainly ought to obtain some vouchers. And if
      that be the only objection, I trust we may soon congratulate Miss
      Hazeldean on a marriage with a man who, though certainly very poor, has
      borne privations without a murmur; has preferred all hardship to debt; has
      scorned to attempt betraying the young lady into any clandestine
      connection; who, in short, has shown himself so upright and honest, that I
      hope my dear Mr. Hazeldean will forgive him if he is only a doctor&mdash;probably
      of Laws&mdash;and not, as most foreigners pretend to be, a marquis or a
      baron at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that," cried the squire, "It is the best thing I know about
      Rickeybockey that he don't attempt to humbug us by any such foreign
      trumpery. Thank Heaven, the Hazeldeans of Hazeldean were never
      tuft-hunters and title-mongers; and if I never ran after an English lord,
      I should certainly be devilishly ashamed of a brother-in-law whom I was
      forced to call markee or count! I should feel sure he was a courier, or
      runaway valley-de-sham. Turn up your nose at a doctor, indeed, Harry!&mdash;pshaw,
      good English style that! Doctor! my aunt married a Doctor of Divinity&mdash;excellent
      man&mdash;wore a wig and was made a dean! So long as Rickeybockey is not a
      doctor of physic, I don't care a button. If he's that, indeed, it would be
      suspicious; because, you see, those foreign doctors of physic are quacks,
      and tell fortunes, and go about on a stage with a Merry-Andrew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! Hazeldean, where on earth did you pick up that idea?" said Harry,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pick it up!&mdash;why, I saw a fellow myself at the cattle fair last year&mdash;when
      I was buying short-horns&mdash;with a red waistcoat and a cocked hat, a
      little like the parson's shovel. He called himself Dr. Phoscophornio, and
      sold pills. The Merry-Andrew was the funniest creature, in salmon-coloured
      tights, turned head over heels, and said he came from Timbuctoo. No, no:
      if Rickeybockey's a physic Doctor, we shall have Jemima in a pink tinsel
      dress tramping about the country in a caravan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this notion both the squire and his wife laughed so heartily that the
      parson felt the thing was settled, and slipped away, with the intention of
      making his report to Riccabocca.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was with a slight disturbance of his ordinary suave and well-bred
      equanimity that the Italian received the information that he need
      apprehend no obstacle to his suit from the insular prejudices or the
      worldly views of the lady's family. Not that he was mean and cowardly
      enough to recoil from the near and unclouded prospect of that felicity
      which he had left off his glasses to behold with unblinking, naked eyes,&mdash;no,
      there his mind was made up; but he had met in life with much that inclines
      a man towards misanthropy, and he was touched not only by the interest in
      his welfare testified by a heretical priest, but by the generosity with
      which he was admitted into a well-born and wealthy family, despite his
      notorious poverty and his foreign descent. He conceded the propriety of
      the only stipulation, which was conveyed to him by the parson with all the
      delicacy that became one long professionally habituated to deal with the
      subtler susceptibilities of mankind,&mdash;namely, that, amongst
      Riccabocca's friends or kindred, some person should be found whose report
      would confirm the persuasion of his respectability entertained by his
      neighbours,&mdash;he assented, I say, to the propriety of this condition;
      but it was not with alacrity and eagerness. His brow became clouded. The
      parson hastened to assure him that the squire was not a man qui stupet in
      titulis,&mdash;["Who was besotted with titles."]&mdash;that he neither
      expected nor desired to find an origin and rank for his brother-in-law
      above that decent mediocrity of condition to which it was evident from
      Riccabocca's breeding and accomplishments he could easily establish his
      claim. "And though," said he, smiling, "the squire is a warm politician in
      his own country, and would never see his sister again, I fear, if she
      married some convicted enemy of our happy constitution, yet for foreign
      politics he does not care a straw; so that if, as I suspect, your exile
      arises from some quarrel with your government,&mdash;which, being foreign,
      he takes for granted must be insupportable,&mdash;he would but consider
      you as he would a Saxon who fled from the iron hand of William the
      Conqueror, or a Lancastrian expelled by the Yorkists in our Wars of the
      Roses."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian smiled. "Mr. Hazeldean shall be satisfied," said he, simply.
      "I see, by the squire's newspaper, that an English gentleman who knew me
      in my own country has just arrived in London. I will write to him for a
      testimonial, at least to my probity and character. Probably he may be
      known to you by name,&mdash;nay, he must be, for he was a distinguished
      officer in the late war. I allude to Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know Lord L'Estrange?&mdash;profligate, bad man, I fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Profligate! bad!" exclaimed Riccabocca. "Well, calumnious as the world
      is, I should never have thought that such expressions would be applied to
      one who, though I knew him but little,&mdash;knew him chiefly by the
      service he once rendered to me,&mdash;first taught me to love and revere
      the English name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may be changed since&mdash;" the parson paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since when?" asked Riccabocca, with evident curiosity. Mr. Dale seemed
      embarrassed. "Excuse me," said he, "it is many years ago; and in short the
      opinion I then formed of the nobleman you named was based upon
      circumstances which I cannot communicate."
    </p>
    <p>
      The punctilious Italian bowed in silence, but he still looked as if he
      should have liked to prosecute inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause he said, "Whatever your impression respecting Lord
      L'Estrange, there is nothing, I suppose, which would lead you to doubt his
      honour, or reject his testimonial in my favour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "According to fashionable morality," said Mr. Dale, rather precisely, "I
      know of nothing that could induce me to suppose that Lord L'Estrange would
      not, in this instance, speak the truth. And he has unquestionably a high
      reputation as a soldier, and a considerable position in the world."
      Therewith the parson took his leave. A few days afterwards, Dr. Riccabocca
      inclosed to the squire, in a blank envelope, a letter he had received from
      Harley L'Estrange. It was evidently intended for the squire's eye, and to
      serve as a voucher for the Italian's respectability; but this object was
      fulfilled, not in the coarse form of a direct testimonial, but with a tact
      and delicacy which seemed to show more than the fine breeding to be
      expected from one in Lord L'Estrange's station. It evinced that most
      exquisite of all politeness which comes from the heart; a certain tone of
      affectionate respect (which even the homely sense of the squire felt,
      intuitively, proved far more in favour of Riccabocca than the most
      elaborate certificate of his qualities and antecedents) pervaded the
      whole, and would have sufficed in itself to remove all scruples from a
      mind much more suspicious and exacting than that of the Squire of
      Hazeldean. But, to and behold! an obstacle now occurred to the parson, of
      which he ought to have thought long before,&mdash;namely, the Papistical
      religion of the Italian. Dr. Riccabocca was professedly a Roman Catholic.
      He so little obtruded that fact&mdash;and, indeed, had assented so readily
      to any animadversions upon the superstition and priestcraft which,
      according to Protestants, are the essential characteristics of Papistical
      communities&mdash;that it was not till the hymeneal torch, which brings
      all faults to light, was fairly illumined for the altar, that the
      remembrance of a faith so cast into the shade burst upon the conscience of
      the parson. The first idea that then occurred to him was the proper and
      professional one,&mdash;namely, the conversion of Dr. Riccabocca. He
      hastened to his study, took down from his shelves long neglected volumes
      of controversial divinity, armed himself with an arsenal of authorities,
      arguments, and texts; then, seizing the shovel-hat, posted off to the
      Casino.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The parson burst upon the philosopher like an avalanche! He was so full of
      his subject that he could not let it out in prudent driblets. No, he went
      souse upon the astounded Riccabocca&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  "Tremendo
          Jupiter ipse rueus tumultu."
</pre>
    <p>
      The sage&mdash;shrinking deeper into his armchair, and drawing his
      dressing-robe more closely round him&mdash;suffered the parson to talk for
      three quarters of an hour, till indeed he had thoroughly proved his case;
      and, like Brutus, "paused for a reply."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said Riccabocca mildly: "In much of what you have urged so ably, and
      so suddenly, I am inclined to agree. But base is the man who formally
      forswears the creed he has inherited from his fathers, and professed since
      the cradle up to years of maturity, when the change presents itself in the
      guise of a bribe; when, for such is human nature, he can hardly
      distinguish or disentangle the appeal to his reason from the lure to his
      interests,&mdash;here a text, and there a dowry!&mdash;here Protestantism,
      there Jemima! Own, my friend, that the soberest casuist would see double
      under the inebriating effects produced by so mixing his polemical liquors.
      Appeal, my good Mr. Dale, from Philip drunken to Philip sober!&mdash;from
      Riccabocca intoxicated with the assurance of your excellent lady, that he
      is about to be 'the happiest of men,' to Riccabocca accustomed to his
      happiness, and carrying it off with the seasoned equability of one grown
      familiar with stimulants,&mdash;in a word, appeal from Riccabocca the
      wooer to Riccabocca the spouse. I may be convertible, but conversion is a
      slow progress; courtship should be a quick one,&mdash;ask Miss Jemima.
      Finalmente, marry me first, and convert me afterwards!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take this too jestingly," began the parson; "and I don't see why,
      with your excellent understanding, truths so plain and obvious should not
      strike you at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truths," interrupted Riccabocca, profoundly, "are the slowest growing
      things in the world! It took fifteen hundred years from the date of the
      Christian era to produce your own Luther, and then he flung his Bible at
      Satan (I have seen the mark made by the book on the wall of his prison in
      Germany), besides running off with a nun, which no Protestant clergyman
      would think it proper and right to do nowadays." Then he added, with
      seriousness, "Look you, my dear sir, I should lose my own esteem if I were
      even to listen to you now with becoming attention,&mdash;now, I say, when
      you hint that the creed I have professed may be in the way of my
      advantage. If so, I must keep the creed and resign the advantage. But if,
      as I trust not only as a Christian but a man of honour, you will defer
      this discussion, I will promise to listen to you hereafter; and though, to
      say truth, I believe that you will not convert me, I will promise you
      faithfully never to interfere with my wife's religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And any children you may have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Children!" said Dr. Riccabocca, recoiling; "you are not contented with
      firing your pocket-pistol right in my face! you must also pepper me all
      over with small shot. Children! well, if they are girls, let them follow
      the faith of their mother; and if boys, while in childhood, let them be
      contented with learning to be Christians; and when they grow into men, let
      them choose for themselves which is the best form for the practice of the
      great principles which all sects have in common."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," began Mr. Dale again, pulling a large book from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca flung open the window, and jumped out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the rapidest and most dastardly flight you could possibly conceive;
      but it was a great compliment to the argumentative powers of the parson,
      and he felt it as such. Nevertheless, Mr. Dale thought it right to have a
      long conversation, both with the squire and Miss Jemima herself, upon the
      subject which his intended convert had so ignominiously escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, though a great foe to Popery, politically considered, had also
      quite as great a hatred to renegades and apostates. And in his heart he
      would have despised Riccabocca if he could have thrown off his religion as
      easily as he had done his spectacles. Therefore he said simply, "Well, it
      is certainly a great pity that Rickeybockey is not of the Church of
      England; though, I take it, that would be unreasonable to expect in a man
      born and bred under the nose of the Inquisition" (the squire firmly
      believed that the Inquisition was in full force in all the Italian States,
      with whips, racks, and thumbscrews; and, indeed, his chief information of
      Italy was gathered from a perusal he had given in early youth to "The
      One-Handed Monk"); "but I think he speaks very fairly, on the whole, as to
      his wife and children. And the thing's gone too far now to retract. It's
      all your fault for not thinking of it before; and I've now just made up my
      mind as to the course to pursue respecting the d&mdash;-d stocks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Miss Jemima, the parson left her with a pious thanksgiving that
      Riccabocca at least was a Christian, and not a Pagan, Mahometan, or Jew!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is that in a wedding which appeals to a universal sympathy. No other
      event in the lives of their superiors in rank creates an equal sensation
      amongst the humbler classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment the news that Miss Jemima was to be married had spread
      throughout the village, all the old affection for the squire and his House
      burst forth the stronger for its temporary suspension. Who could think of
      the stocks in such a season? The stocks were swept out of fashion,&mdash;hunted
      from remembrance as completely as the question of Repeal or the thought of
      Rebellion from the warm Irish heart, when the fair young face of the Royal
      Wife beamed on the sister isle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again cordial courtesies were dropped at the thresholds by which the
      squire passed to his own farm; again the sunburned brows uncovered&mdash;no
      more with sullen ceremony&mdash;were smoothed into cheerful gladness at
      his nod. Nay, the little ones began again to assemble at their ancient
      rendezvous by the stocks, as if either familiarized with the phenomenon,
      or convinced that, in the general sentiment of good-will, its powers of
      evil were annulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire tasted once more the sweets of the only popularity which is
      much worth having, and the loss of which a wise man would reasonably
      deplore,&mdash;namely, the popularity which arises from a persuasion of
      our goodness, and a reluctance to recall our faults. Like all blessings,
      the more sensibly felt from previous interruption, the squire enjoyed this
      restored popularity with an exhilarated sense of existence; his stout
      heart beat more vigorously; his stalwart step trod more lightly; his
      comely English face looked comelier and more English than ever,&mdash;you
      would have been a merrier man for a week to have come within hearing of
      his jovial laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt grateful to Jemima and to Riccabocca as the special agents of
      Providence in this general integratio amoris. To have looked at him, you
      would suppose that it was the squire who was going to be married a second
      time to his Harry!
    </p>
    <p>
      One may well conceive that such would have been an inauspicious moment for
      Parson Dale's theological scruples to have stopped that marriage, chilled
      all the sunshine it diffused over the village, seen himself surrounded
      again by long sulky visages,&mdash;I verily believe, though a better
      friend of Church and State never stood on a hustings, that, rather than
      court such a revulsion, the squire would have found jesuitical excuses for
      the marriage if Riccabocca had been discovered to be the Pope in disguise!
      As for the stocks, its fate was now irrevocably sealed. In short, the
      marriage was concluded,&mdash;first privately, according to the
      bridegrooms creed, by a Roman Catholic clergyman, who lived in a town some
      miles off, and next publicly in the village church of Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the heartiest rural wedding! Village girls strewed flowers on the
      way; a booth was placed amidst the prettiest scenery of the Park on the
      margin of the lake&mdash;for there was to be a dance later in the day.
      Even Mr. Stirn&mdash;no, Mr. Stirn was not present; so much happiness
      would have been the death of him! And the Papisher too, who had conjured
      Lenny out of the stocks nay, who had himself sat in the stocks for the
      very purpose of bringing them into contempt,&mdash;the Papisher! he had a
      lief Miss Jemima had married the devil! Indeed he was persuaded that, in
      point of fact, it was all one and the same. Therefore Mr. Stirn had asked
      leave to go and attend his uncle the pawnbroker, about to undergo a
      torturing operation for the stone! Frank was there, summoned from Eton for
      the occasion&mdash;having grown two inches taller since he left&mdash;for
      the one inch of which nature was to be thanked, for the other a new pair
      of resplendent Wellingtons. But the boy's joy was less apparent than that
      of others. For Jemima, was a special favourite with him, as she would have
      been with all boys,&mdash;for she was always kind and gentle, and made him
      many pretty presents whenever she came from the watering-places; and Frank
      knew that he should miss her sadly, and thought she had made a very queer
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Higginbotham had been invited; but to the astonishment of Jemima,
      he had replied to the invitation by a letter to herself, marked "private
      and confidential."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must have long known," said the letter, "of his devoted attachment to
      her! motives of delicacy, arising from the narrowness of his income and
      the magnanimity of his sentiments, had alone prevented his formal
      proposals; but now that he was informed (he could scarcely believe his
      senses or command his passions) that her relations wished to force her
      into a BARBAROUS marriage with a foreigner of MOST FORBIDDING APPEARANCE,
      and most abject circumstances, he lost not a moment in laying at her feet
      his own hand and fortune. And he did this the more confidently, inasmuch
      as he could not but be aware of Miss Jemima's SECRET feelings towards him,
      while he was proud and happy to say, that his dear and distinguished
      cousin, Mr. Sharpe Currie, had honoured him with a warmth of regard which
      justified the most brilliant EXPECTATIONS,&mdash;likely to be soon
      realized, as his eminent relative had contracted a very bad liver
      complaint in the service of his country, and could not last long!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the years they had known each other, Miss Jemima, strange as it may
      appear, had never once suspected the captain of any other feelings to her
      than those of a brother. To say that she was not gratified by learning her
      mistake would be to say that she was more than woman. Indeed, it must have
      been a source of no ignoble triumph to think that she could prove her
      disinterested affection to her dear Riccabocca by a prompt rejection of
      this more brilliant offer. She couched the rejection, it is true, in the
      most soothing terms. But the captain evidently considered himself ill
      used; he did not reply to the letter, and did not come to the wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      To let the reader into a secret, never known to Miss Jemima, Captain
      Higginbotham was much less influenced by Cupid than by Plutus in the offer
      he had made. The captain was one of that class of gentlemen who read their
      accounts by those corpse-lights, or will-o'-the-wisps, called
      expectations. Ever since the squire's grandfather had left him&mdash;then
      in short clothes&mdash;a legacy of L500, the captain had peopled the
      future with expectations! He talked of his expectations as a man talks of
      shares in a Tontine; they might fluctuate a little,&mdash;be now up and
      now down,&mdash;but it was morally impossible, if he lived on, but that he
      should be a millionnaire one of these days. Now, though Miss Jemima was a
      good fifteen years younger than himself, yet she always stood for a good
      round sum in the ghostly books of the captain. She was an expectation to
      the full amount of her L4000, seeing that Frank was an only child, and it
      would be carrying coals to Newcastle to leave him anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than see so considerable a cipher suddenly sponged out of his
      visionary ledger, rather than so much money should vanish clean out of the
      family, Captain Higginbotham had taken what he conceived, if a desperate,
      at least a certain, step for the preservation of his property. If the
      golden horn could not be had without the heifer, why, he must take the
      heifer into the bargain. He had never formed to himself an idea that a
      heifer so gentle would toss and fling him over. The blow was stunning. But
      no one compassionates the misfortunes of the covetous, though few perhaps
      are in greater need of compassion. And leaving poor Captain Higginbotham
      to retrieve his illusory fortunes as he best may among "the expectations"
      which gathered round the form of Mr. Sharpe Currie, who was the crossest
      old tyrant imaginable, and never allowed at his table any dishes not
      compounded with rice, which played Old Nick with the captain's
      constitutional functions, I return to the wedding at Hazeldean, just in
      time to see the bridegroom&mdash;who looked singularly well on the
      occasion&mdash;hand the bride (who, between sunshiny tears and
      affectionate smiles, was really a very interesting and even a pretty
      bride, as brides go) into a carriage which the squire had presented to
      them, and depart on the orthodox nuptial excursion amidst the blessings of
      the assembled crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be thought strange by the unreflective that these rural spectators
      should so have approved and blessed the marriage of a Hazeldean of
      Hazeldean with a poor, outlandish, long-haired foreigner; but besides that
      Riccabocca, after all, had become one of the neighbourhood, and was
      proverbially "a civil-spoken gentleman," it is generally noticeable that
      on wedding occasions the bride so monopolizes interest, curiosity, and
      admiration that the bridegroom himself goes for little or nothing. He is
      merely the passive agent in the affair,&mdash;the unregarded cause of the
      general satisfaction. It was not Riccabocca himself that they approved and
      blessed,&mdash;it was the gentleman in the white waistcoat who had made
      Miss Jemima Madam Rickeybockey!
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning on his wife's arm (for it was a habit of the squire to lean on his
      wife's arm rather than she on his, when he was specially pleased; and
      there was something touching in the sight of that strong sturdy frame thus
      insensibly, in hours of happiness, seeking dependence on the frail arm of
      woman),&mdash;leaning, I say, on his wife's arm, the squire, about the
      hour of sunset, walked down to the booth by the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the parish-young and old, man, woman, and child, were assembled there,
      and their faces seemed to bear one family likeness, in the common emotion
      which animated all, as they turned to his frank, fatherly smile. Squire
      Hazeldean stood at the head of the long table: he filled a horn with ale
      from the brimming tankard beside him. Then he looked round, and lifted his
      hand to request silence; and ascending the chair, rose in full view of
      all. Every one felt that the squire was about to make a speech, and the
      earnestness of the attention was proportioned to the rarity of the event;
      for (though he was not unpractised in the oratory of the hustings) only
      thrice before had the squire made what could fairly be called "a speech"
      to the villagers of Hazeldean,&mdash;once on a kindred festive occasion,
      when he had presented to them his bride; once in a contested election for
      the shire, in which he took more than ordinary interest, and was not quite
      so sober as he ought to have been; once in a time of great agricultural
      distress, when in spite of reduction of rents, the farmers had been
      compelled to discard a large number of their customary labourers, and when
      the squire had said, "I have given up keeping the hounds because I want to
      make a fine piece of water (that was the origin of the lake), and to drain
      all the low lands round the Park. Let every man who wants work come to
      me!" And that sad year the parish rates of Hazeldean were not a penny the
      heavier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the fourth time, the squire rose, and thus he spoke,&mdash;at his
      right hand, Harry; at his left, Frank; at the bottom of the table, as
      vice-president, Parson Dale, his little wife behind him, only obscurely
      seen. She cried readily, and her handkerchief was already before her eyes.

    <h3>
      THE SQUIRE'S SPEECH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Friends and neighbours, I thank you kindly for coming round me this day,
      and for showing so much interest in me and mine. My cousin was not born
      amongst you as I was, but you have known her from a child. It is a
      familiar face, and one that never frowned, which you will miss at your
      cottage doors, as I and mine will miss it long in the old Hall&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a sob from some of the women, and nothing was seen of Mrs.
      Dale but the white handkerchief. The squire himself paused, and brushed
      away a tear with the back of his hand. Then he resumed, with a sudden
      change of voice that was electrical,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "For we none of us prize a blessing till we have lost it! Now, friends and
      neighbours, a little time ago, it seemed as if some ill-will had crept
      into the village,&mdash;ill-will between you and me, neighbours!&mdash;why,
      that is not like Hazeldean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience hung their heads! You never saw people look so thoroughly
      ashamed of themselves. The squire proceeded,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't say it was all your fault; perhaps it was mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noa, noa, noa," burst forth in a general chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, friends," continued the squire, humbly, and in one of those
      illustrative aphorisms which, if less subtle than Riccabocca's, were more
      within reach of the popular comprehension,&mdash;"nay, we are all human,
      and every man has his hobby; sometimes he breaks in the hobby, and
      sometimes the hobby, if it is very hard in the mouth, breaks in him. One
      man's hobby has an ill habit of always stopping at the public house!
      [Laughter.] Another man's hobby refuses to stir a peg beyond the door
      where some buxom lass patted its neck the week before,&mdash;a hobby I
      rode pretty often when I went courting my good wife here! [Much laughter
      and applause.] Others have a lazy hobby that there's no getting on;
      others, a runaway hobby that there's no stopping: but to cut the matter
      short, my favourite hobby, as you well know, is always trotted out to any
      place on my property which seems to want the eye and hand of the master. I
      hate," cried the squire, warming, "to see things neglected and decayed,
      and going to the dogs! This land we live in is a good mother to us, and we
      can't do too much for her. It is very true, neighbours, that I owe her a
      good many acres, and ought to speak well of her; but what then? I live
      amongst you, and what I take from the rent with one hand, I divide amongst
      you with the other. [Low but assenting murmurs.] Now the more I improve my
      property, the more mouths it feeds. My great-grandfather kept a Field-book
      in which were entered not only the names of all the farmers and the
      quantity of land they held, but the average number of the labourers each
      employed. My grandfather and father followed his example: I have done the
      same. I find, neighbours, that our rents have doubled since my
      great-grandfather began to make the book. Ay,&mdash;but there are more
      than four times the number of labourers employed on the estate, and at
      much better wages too! Well, my men, that says a great deal in favour of
      improving property, and not letting it go to the dogs. [Applause.] And
      therefore, neighbours, you will kindly excuse my bobby: it carries grist
      to your mill. [Reiterated applause.] Well, but you will say, 'What's the
      squire driving at?' Why this, my friends: There was only one worn-out,
      dilapidated, tumble-down thing in the parish of Hazeldean, and it became
      an eyesore to me; so I saddled my hobby, and rode at it. Oh, ho! you know
      what I mean now! Yes, but, neighbours, you need not have taken it so to
      heart. That was a scurvy trick of some of you to hang me in effigy, as
      they call it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It warn't you," cried a voice in the crowd, "it war Nick Stirn."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire recognized the voice of the tinker; but though he now guessed
      at the ringleader, on that day of general amnesty he had the prudence and
      magnanimity not to say, "Stand forth, Sprott: thou art the man." Yet his
      gallant English spirit would not suffer him to come off at the expense of
      his servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it was Nick Stirn you meant," said he, gravely, "more shame for you.
      It showed some pluck to hang the master; but to hang the poor servant, who
      only thought to do his duty, careless of what ill-will it brought upon
      him, was a shabby trick,&mdash;so little like the lads of Hazeldean, that
      I suspect the man who taught it to them was never born in the parish. But
      let bygones be bygones. One thing is clear,&mdash;you don't take kindly to
      my new pair of stocks! The stocks has been a stumbling-block and a
      grievance, and there's no denying that we went on very pleasantly without
      it. I may also say that, in spite of it, we have been coming together
      again lately. And I can't tell you what good it did me to see your
      children playing again on the green, and your honest faces, in spite of
      the stocks, and those diabolical tracts you've been reading lately,
      lighted up at the thought that something pleasant was going on at the
      Hall. Do you know, neighbours, you put me in mind of an old story which,
      besides applying to the parish, all who are married, and all who intend to
      marry, will do well to recollect. A worthy couple, named John and Joan,
      had lived happily together many a long year, till one unlucky day they
      bought a new bolster. Joan said the bolster was too hard, and John that it
      was too soft. So, of course, they quarrelled. After sulking all day, they
      agreed to put the bolster between them at night." (Roars of laughter
      amongst the men; the women did not know which way to look, except, indeed,
      Mrs. Hazeldean, who, though she was more than usually rosy, maintained her
      innocent genial smile, as much as to say, "There is no harm in the
      squire's jests.") The orator resumed, "After they had thus lain apart for
      a little time, very silent and sullen, John sneezed. 'God bless you!' says
      Joan, over the bolster. 'Did you say God bless me?' cries John, 'then here
      goes the bolster!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Prolonged laughter and tumultuous applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends and neighbours," said the squire, when silence was restored, and
      lifting the horn of ale, "I have the pleasure to inform you that I have
      ordered the stocks to be taken down, and made into a bench for the
      chimney-nook of our old friend Gaffer Solomons yonder. But mind me, lads,
      if ever you make the parish regret the loss of the stocks, and the
      overseers come to me with long faces, and say, 'The stocks must be
      rebuilded,' why&mdash;" Here from all the youth of the village rose so
      deprecating a clamour, that the squire would have been the most burgling
      orator in the world, if he said a word further on the subject. He elevated
      the horn over his head&mdash;"Why, that's my old Hazeldean again! Health
      and long life to you all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinker had sneaked out of the assembly, and did not show his face in
      the village for the next six months. And as to those poisonous tracts, in
      spite of their salubrious labels, "The Poor Man's Friend," or "The Rights
      of Labour," you could no more have found one of them lurking in the
      drawers of the kitchen dressers in Hazeldean than you would have found the
      deadly nightshade on the flower-stands in the drawing-room of the Hall. As
      for the revolutionary beerhouse, there was no need to apply to the
      magistrates to shut it up,&mdash;it shut itself up before the week was
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      O young head of the great House of Hapsburg, what a Hazeldean you might
      have made of Hungary! What a "Moriamur pro rege nostro!" would have rung
      in your infant reign,&mdash;if you had made such a speech as the squire's!

    <h2>
      INITIAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      COMPRISING MR. CAXTON'S OPINIONS ON THE MATRIMONIAL STATE, SUPPORTED BY
      LEARNED AUTHORITIES.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was no bad idea of yours, Pisistratus," said my father, graciously,
      "to depict the heightened affections and the serious intention of Signor
      Riccabocca by a single stroke,&mdash;He left of his spectacles! Good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet," quoth my uncle, "I think Shakspeare represents a lover as falling
      into slovenly habits, neglecting his person, and suffering his hose to be
      ungartered, rather than paying that attention to his outer man which
      induces Signor Riccabocca to leave off his spectacles, and look as
      handsome as nature will permit him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are different degrees and many phases of the passion," replied my
      father. "Shakspeare is speaking of an ill-treated, pining, woe-begone
      lover, much aggrieved by the cruelty of his mistress,&mdash;a lover who
      has found it of no avail to smarten himself up, and has fallen
      despondently into the opposite extreme. Whereas Signor Riccabocca has
      nothing to complain of in the barbarity of Miss Jemima."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed he has not!" cried Blanche, tossing her head,&mdash;"forward
      creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear," said my mother, trying her best to look stately, "I am
      decidedly of opinion that, in that respect, Pisistratus has lowered the
      dignity of the sex. Not intentionally," added my mother, mildly, and
      afraid she had said something too bitter; "but it is very hard for a man
      to describe us women."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded approvingly; Mr. Squills smiled; my father quietly
      resumed the thread of his discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To continue," quoth he. "Riccabocca has no reason to despair of success
      in his suit, nor any object in moving his mistress to compassion. He may,
      therefore, very properly tie up his garters and leave off his spectacles.
      What do you say, Mr. Squills?&mdash;for, after all, since love-making
      cannot fail to be a great constitutional derangement, the experience of a
      medical man must be the best to consult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Caxton," replied Squills, obviously flattered, "you are quite right:
      when a man makes love, the organs of self-esteem and desire of applause
      are greatly stimulated, and therefore, of course, he sets himself off to
      the best advantage. It is only, as you observe, when, like Shakspeare's
      lover, he has given up making love as a bad job, and has received that
      severe hit on the ganglions which the cruelty of a mistress inflicts, that
      he neglects his personal appearance: he neglects it, not because he is in
      love, but because his nervous system is depressed. That was the cause, if
      you remember, with poor Major Prim. He wore his wig all awry when Susan
      Smart jilted him; but I set it right for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By shaming Miss Smart into repentance, or getting him a new sweetheart?"
      asked my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" answered Squills, "by quinine and cold bathing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may therefore grant," renewed my father, "that, as a general rule, the
      process of courtship tends to the spruceness, and even foppery, of the
      individual engaged in the experiment, as Voltaire has very prettily proved
      somewhere. Nay, the Mexicans, indeed, were of opinion that the lady at
      least ought to continue those cares of her person even after marriage.
      There is extant, in Sahagun's 'History of New Spain,' the advice of an
      Aztec or Mexican mother to her daughter, in which she says, 'That your
      husband may not take you in dislike, adorn yourself, wash yourself, and
      let your garments be clean.' It is true that the good lady adds, 'Do it in
      moderation; since if every day you are washing yourself and your clothes,
      the world will say that you are over-delicate; and particular people will
      call you&mdash;TAPETZON TINEMAXOCH!' What those words precisely mean,"
      added my father, modestly, "I cannot say, since I never had the
      opportunity to acquire the ancient Aztec language,&mdash;but something
      very opprobrious and horrible, no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say a philosopher like Signor Riccabocca," said my uncle, "was not
      himself very tapetzon tine&mdash;what d' ye call it?&mdash;and a good
      healthy English wife, that poor affectionate Jemima, was thrown away upon
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roland," said my father, "you don't like foreigners; a respectable
      prejudice, and quite natural in a man who has been trying his best to hew
      them in pieces and blow them up into splinters. But you don't like
      philosophers either,&mdash;and for that dislike you have no equally good
      reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only implied that they are not much addicted to soap and water," said
      my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A notable mistake. Many great philosophers have been very great beaux.
      Aristotle was a notorious fop. Buffon put on his best laced ruffles when
      he sat down to write, which implies that he washed his hands first.
      Pythagoras insists greatly on the holiness of frequent ablutions; and
      Horace&mdash;who, in his own way, was as good a philosopher as any the
      Romans produced&mdash;takes care to let us know what a neat, well-dressed,
      dapper little gentleman he was. But I don't think you ever read the
      'Apology' of Apuleius?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I; what is it about?" asked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About a great many things. It is that Sage's vindication from several
      malignant charges,&mdash;amongst others, and principally indeed, that of
      being much too refined and effeminate for a philosopher. Nothing can
      exceed the rhetorical skill with which he excuses himself for using&mdash;tooth-powder.
      'Ought a philosopher,' he exclaims, 'to allow anything unclean about him,
      especially in the mouth,&mdash;the mouth, which is the vestibule of the
      soul, the gate of discourse, the portico of thought! Ah, but AEmilianus
      [the accuser of Apuleius] never opens his mouth but for slander and
      calumny,&mdash;tooth-powder would indeed be unbecoming to him! Or, if he
      use any, it will not be my good Arabian tooth powder, but charcoal and
      cinders. Ay, his teeth should be as foul as his language! And yet even the
      crocodile likes to have his teeth cleaned; insects get into them, and,
      horrible reptile though he be, he opens his jaws inoffensively to a
      faithful dentistical bird, who volunteers his beak for a toothpick.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      My father was now warm in the subject he had started, and soared miles
      away from Riccabocca and "My Novel." "And observe," he exclaimed,&mdash;"observe
      with what gravity this eminent Platonist pleads guilty to the charge of
      having a mirror. 'Why, what,' he exclaims, 'more worthy of the regards of
      a human creature than his own image' nihil respectabilius homini quam
      formam suam! Is not that one of our children the most dear to us who is
      called 'the picture of his father'? But take what pains you will with a
      picture, it can never be so like you as the face in your mirror! Think it
      discreditable to look with proper attention on one's self in the glass!
      Did not Socrates recommend such attention to his disciples,&mdash;did he
      not make a great moral agent of the speculum? The handsome, in admiring
      their beauty therein, were admonished that handsome is who handsome does;
      and the more the ugly stared at themselves, the more they became naturally
      anxious to hide the disgrace of their features in the loveliness of their
      merits. Was not Demosthenes always at his speculum? Did he not rehearse
      his causes before it as before a master in the art? He learned his
      eloquence from Plato, his dialectics from Eubulides; but as for his
      delivery&mdash;there, he came to the mirror!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore," concluded Mr. Caxton, returning unexpectedly to the subject,&mdash;"therefore,
      it is no reason to suppose that Dr. Riccabocca is averse to cleanliness
      and decent care of the person because he is a philosopher; and, all things
      considered, he never showed himself more a philosopher than when he left
      off his spectacles and looked his best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said my mother, kindly, "I only hope it may turn out happily. But
      I should have been better pleased if Pisistratus had not made Dr.
      Riccabocca so reluctant a wooer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true," said the captain; "the Italian does not shine as a lover.
      Throw a little more fire into him, Pisistratus,&mdash;something gallant
      and chivalrous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fire! gallantry! chivalry!" cried my father, who had taken Riccabocca
      under his special protection; "why, don't you see that the man is
      described as a philosopher?&mdash;and I should like to know when a
      philosopher ever plunged into matrimony without considerable misgivings
      and cold shivers! Indeed, it seems that&mdash;perhaps before he was a
      philosopher&mdash;Riccabocca had tried the experiment, and knew what it
      was. Why, even that plain-speaking, sensible, practical man, Metellus
      Numidicus, who was not even a philosopher, but only a Roman censor, thus
      expressed himself in an exhortation to the people to perpetrate matrimony:
      'If, O Quirites, we could do without wives, we should all dispense with
      that subject of care <i>ea molestia careremus;</i> but since nature has so
      managed it that we cannot live with women comfortably, nor without them at
      all, let us rather provide for the human race than our own temporary
      felicity.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the ladies set up such a cry of indignation, that both Roland and
      myself endeavoured to appease their wrath by hasty assurances that we
      utterly repudiated the damnable doctrine of Metellus Numidicus.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father, wholly unmoved, as soon as a sullen silence was established,
      recommenced. "Do not think, ladies," said he, "that you were without
      advocates at that day: there were many Romans gallant enough to blame the
      censor for a mode of expressing himself which they held to be equally
      impolite and injudicious. 'Surely,' said they, with some plausibility, if
      Numidicus wished men to marry, he need not have referred so peremptorily
      to the disquietudes of the connection, and thus have made them more
      inclined to turn away from matrimony than give them a relish for it.' But
      against these critics one honest man (whose name of Titus Castricius
      should not be forgotten by posterity) maintained that Metellus Numidicus
      could not have spoken more properly; 'For remark,' said he, 'that Metellus
      was a censor, not a rhetorician. It becomes rhetoricians to adorn and
      disguise and make the best of things; but Metellus, sanctus vir,&mdash;a
      holy and blameless man, grave and sincere to wit, and addressing the Roman
      people in the solemn capacity of Censor,&mdash;was bound to speak the
      plain truth, especially as he was treating of a subject on which the
      observation of every day, and the experience of every life, could not
      leave the least doubt upon the mind of his audience.' Still, Riccabocca,
      having decided to marry, has no doubt prepared himself to bear all the
      concomitant evils&mdash;as becomes a professed sage; and I own I admire
      the art with which Pisistratus has drawn the kind of woman most likely to
      suit a philosopher&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pisistratus bows, and looks round complacently; but recoils from two very
      peevish and discontented faces feminine.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (completing his sentence).&mdash;"Not only as regards mildness
      of temper and other household qualifications, but as regards the very
      person of the object of his choice. For you evidently remember,
      Pisistratus, the reply of Bias, when asked his opinion on marriage: [Long
      sentence in Greek]"
    </p>
    <p>
      Pisistratus tries to look as if he had the opinion of Bias by heart, and
      nods acquiescingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"That is, my dears, 'The woman you would marry is either
      handsome or ugly: if handsome, she is koine,&mdash;namely, you don't have
      her to yourself; if ugly, she is poine,&mdash;that is, a fury.' But, as it
      is observed in Aulus Gellius (whence I borrow this citation), there is a
      wide interval between handsome and ugly. And thus Ennius, in his tragedy
      of 'Menalippus,' uses an admirable expression to designate women of the
      proper degree of matrimonial comeliness, such as a philosopher would
      select. He calls this degree stata forma,&mdash;a rational, mediocre sort
      of beauty, which is not liable to be either koine or poine. And Favorinus,
      who was a remarkably sensible man, and came from Provence&mdash;the male
      inhabitants of which district have always valued themselves on their
      knowledge of love and ladies&mdash;calls this said stata forma the beauty
      of wives,&mdash;the uxorial beauty. Ennius says that women of a stata
      forma are almost always safe and modest. Now, Jemima, you observe, is
      described as possessing this stata forma; and it is the nicety of your
      observation in this respect, which I like the most in the whole of your
      description of a philosopher's matrimonial courtship, Pisistratus
      (excepting only the stroke of the spectacles), for it shows that you had
      properly considered the opinion of Bias, and mastered all the counter
      logic suggested in Book v., chapter xi., of Aulus Gellius."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For all that," said Blanche, half archly, half demurely, with a smile in
      the eye and a pout of the lip, "I don't remember that Pisistratus, in the
      days when he wished to be most complimentary, ever assured me that I had a
      stata forma,&mdash;a rational, mediocre sort of beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I think," observed my uncle, "that when he comes to his real heroine,
      whoever she may be, he will not trouble his head much about either Bias or
      Aulus Gellius."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Matrimony is certainly a great change in life. One is astonished not to
      find a notable alteration in one's friend, even if he or she have been
      only wedded a week. In the instance of Dr. and Mrs. Riccabocca the change
      was peculiarly visible. To speak first of the lady, as in chivalry bound,
      Mrs. Riccabocca had entirely renounced that melancholy which had
      characterized Miss Jemima; she became even sprightly and gay, and looked
      all the better and prettier for the alteration. She did not scruple to
      confess honestly to Mrs. Dale that she was now of opinion that the world
      was very far from approaching its end. But, in the meanwhile, she did not
      neglect the duty which the belief she had abandoned serves to inculcate,&mdash;"She
      set her house in order." The cold and penurious elegance that had
      characterized the Casino disappeared like enchantment,&mdash;that is, the
      elegance remained, but the cold and penury fled before the smile of woman.
      Like Puss-in-Boots, after the nuptials of his master, Jackeymo only now
      caught minnows and sticklebacks for his own amusement. Jackeymo looked
      much plumper, and so did Riccabocca. In a word, the fair Jemima became an
      excellent wife. Riccabocca secretly thought her extravagant, but, like a
      wise man, declined to look at the house bills, and ate his joint in
      unreproachful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed there was so much unaffected kindness in the nature of Mrs.
      Riccabocca&mdash;beneath the quiet of her manner there beat so genially
      the heart of the Hazeldeans&mdash;that she fairly justified the favourable
      anticipations of Mrs. Dale. And though the doctor did not noisily boast of
      his felicity, nor, as some new married folks do, thrust it insultingly
      under the nimis unctis naribus,&mdash;the turned-up noses of your surly
      old married folks,&mdash;nor force it gaudily and glaringly on the envious
      eyes of the single, you might still see that he was a more cheerful and
      light-hearted man than before. His smile was less ironical, his politeness
      less distant. He did not study Machiavelli so intensely,&mdash;and he did
      not return to the spectacles; which last was an excellent sign. Moreover,
      the humanizing influence of the tidy English wife might be seen in the
      improvement of his outward or artificial man. His clothes seemed to fit
      him better; indeed, the clothes were new. Mrs. Dale no longer remarked
      that the buttons were off the wristbands, which was a great satisfaction
      to her. But the sage still remained faithful to the pipe, the cloak, and
      the red silk umbrella. Mrs. Riccabocca had (to her credit be it spoken)
      used all becoming and wife-like arts against these three remnants of the
      old bachelor, Adam, but in vain. "Anima mia," [Soul of mine]&mdash;said
      the doctor, tenderly, "I hold the cloak, the umbrella, and the pipe as the
      sole relics that remain to me of my native country. Respect and spare
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Riccabocca was touched, and had the good sense to perceive that man,
      let him be ever so much married, retains certain signs of his ancient
      independence,&mdash;certain tokens of his old identity, which a wife, the
      most despotic, will do well to concede. She conceded the cloak, she
      submitted to the umbrella, she overcame her abhorrence of the pipe. After
      all, considering the natural villany of our sex, she confessed to herself
      that she might have been worse off. But through all the calm and
      cheerfulness of Riccabocca, a nervous perturbation was sufficiently
      perceptible; it commenced after the second week of marriage; it went on
      increasing, till one bright sunny afternoon, as he was standing on his
      terrace, gazing down upon the road, at which Jackeymo was placed, lo, a
      stage-coach stopped! The doctor made a bound, and put both hands to his
      heart as if he had been shot; he then leaped over the balustrade, and his
      wife from her window beheld him flying down the hill, with his long hair
      streaming in the wind, till the trees hid him from her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," thought she, with a natural pang of conjugal jealousy, "henceforth I
      am only second in his home. He has gone to welcome his child!" And at that
      reflection Mrs. Riccabocca shed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so naturally amiable was she, that she hastened to curb her emotion,
      and efface as well as she could the trace of a stepmother's grief. When
      this was done, and a silent, self-rebuking prayer murmured over, the good
      woman descended the stairs with alacrity, and summoning up her best
      smiles, emerged on the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was repaid; for scarcely had she come into the open air, when two
      little arms were thrown around her, and the sweetest voice that ever came
      from a child's lips sighed out in broken English, "Good mamma, love me a
      little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love you? with my whole heart!" cried the stepmother, with all a mother's
      honest passion. And she clasped the child to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless you, my wife!" said Riccabocca, in a husky tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please take this too," added Jackeymo, in Italian, as well as his sobs
      would let him, and he broke off a great bough full of blossoms from his
      favourite orange-tree, and thrust it into his mistress's hand. She had not
      the slightest notion what he meant by it!

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Violante was indeed a bewitching child,&mdash;a child to whom I defy Mrs.
      Caudle herself (immortal Mrs. Caudle!) to have been a harsh stepmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at her now, as released from those kindly arms, she stands, still
      clinging with one hand to her new mamma, and holding out the other to
      Riccabocca, with those large dark eyes swimming in happy tears. What a
      lovely smile! what an ingenuous, candid brow! She looks delicate, she
      evidently requires care, she wants the mother. And rare is the woman who
      would not love her the better for that! Still, what an innocent, infantine
      bloom in those clear, smooth cheeks! and in that slight frame, what
      exquisite natural grace!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this, I suppose, is your nurse, darling?" said Mrs. Riccabocca,
      observing a dark, foreign-looking woman, dressed very strangely, without
      cap or bonnet, but a great silver arrow stuck in her hair, and a filigree
      chain or necklace resting upon her kerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, good Annetta," said Violante, in Italian. "Papa, she says she is to
      go back; but she is not to go back, is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca, who had scarcely before noticed the woman, started at that
      question, exchanged a rapid glance with Jackeymo, and then, muttering some
      inaudible excuse, approached the nurse, and, beckoning her to follow him,
      went away into the grounds. He did not return for more than an hour, nor
      did the woman then accompany him home. He said briefly to his wife that
      the nurse was obliged to return at once to Italy, and that she would stay
      in the village to catch the mail; that indeed she would be of no use in
      their establishment, as she could not speak a word of English; that he was
      sadly afraid Violante would pine for her. And Violante did pine at first.
      But still, to a child it is so great a thing to find a parent, to be at
      home, that, tender and grateful as Violante was, she could not be
      inconsolable while her father was there to comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first few days, Riccabocca scarcely permitted any one to be with
      his daughter but himself. He would not even leave her alone with his
      Jemima. They walked out together,&mdash;sat together for hours in the
      belvidere. Then by degrees he began to resign her more and more to
      Jemima's care and tuition, especially in English, of which language at
      present she spoke only a few sentences (previously, perhaps, learned by
      heart) so as to be clearly intelligible.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was one person in the establishment of Dr. Riccabocca who was
      satisfied neither with the marriage of his master nor the arrival of
      Violante,&mdash;and that was our friend Lenny Fairfield. Previous to the
      all-absorbing duties of courtship, the young peasant had secured a very
      large share of Riccabocca's attention. The sage had felt interest in the
      growth of this rude intelligence struggling up to light. But what with the
      wooing and what with the wedding, Lenny Fairfield had sunk very much out
      of his artificial position as pupil into his natural station of
      under-gardener. And on the arrival of Violante, he saw, with natural
      bitterness, that he was clean forgotten, not only by Riccabocca, but
      almost by Jackeymo. It was true that the master still lent him books, and
      the servant still gave him lectures on horticulture. But Riccabocca had no
      time nor inclination now to amuse himself with enlightening that tumult of
      conjecture which the books created. And if Jackeymo had been covetous of
      those mines of gold buried beneath the acres now fairly taken from the
      squire (and good-naturedly added rent-free, as an aid to Jemima's dower),
      before the advent of the young lady whose future dowry the produce was to
      swell, now that she was actually under the eyes of the faithful servant,
      such a stimulus was given to his industry that he could think of nothing
      else but the land, and the revolution he designed to effect in its natural
      English crops. The garden, save only the orangetrees, was abandoned
      entirely to Lenny, and additional labourers were called in for the field
      work. Jackeymo had discovered that one part of the soil was suited to
      lavender, that another would grow camomile. He had in his heart
      apportioned a beautiful field of rich loam to flax; but against the growth
      of flax the squire set his face obstinately. That most lucrative, perhaps,
      of all crops when soil and skill suit, was formerly attempted in England
      much more commonly than it is now, since you will find few old leases do
      not contain a clause prohibitory of flax as an impoverishment of the land.
      And though Jackeymo learnedly endeavoured to prove to the squire that the
      flax itself contained particles which, if returned to the soil, repaid all
      that the crop took away, Mr. Hazeldean had his old-fashioned prejudices on
      the matter, which were insuperable. "My forefathers," quoth he, "did not
      put that clause in their leases without good cause; and as the Casino
      lands are entailed on Frank, I have no right to gratify your foreign whims
      at his expense."
    </p>
    <p>
      To make up for the loss of the flax, Jackeymo resolved to convert a very
      nice bit of pasture into orchard ground, which he calculated would bring
      in L10 net per acre by the time Miss Violante was marriageable. At this
      the squire pished a little; but as it was quite clear that the land would
      be all the more valuable hereafter for the fruit-trees, he consented to
      permit the "grass-land" to be thus partially broken up.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these changes left poor Lenny Fairfield very much to himself,&mdash;at
      a time when the new and strange devices which the initiation into book
      knowledge creates made it most desirable that he should have the constant
      guidance of a superior mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening after his work, as Lenny was returning to his mother's
      cottage, very sullen and very moody, he suddenly came in contact with
      Sprott the tinker.

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tinker was seated under a hedge, hammering away at an old kettle, with
      a little fire burning in front of him, and the donkey hard by, indulging
      in a placid doze. Mr. Sprott looked up as Lenny passed, nodded kindly, and
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evenin', Lenny: glad to hear you be so 'spectably sitivated with
      Mounseer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," answered Lenny, with a leaven of rancour in his recollections,
      "you're not ashamed to speak to me now that I am not in disgrace. But it
      was in disgrace, when it wasn't my fault, that the real gentleman was most
      kind to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ar-r, Lenny," said the tinker, with a prolonged rattle in that said Ar-r,
      which was not without great significance. "But you sees the real
      gentleman, who han't got his bread to get, can hafford to 'spise his
      c'racter in the world. A poor tinker must be timbersome and nice in his
      'sociations. But sit down here a bit, Lenny; I've summat to say to ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To ye. Give the neddy a shove out i' the vay, and sit down, I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny rather reluctantly, and somewhat superciliously, accepted this
      invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hears," said the tinker, in a voice made rather indistinct by a couple
      of nails, which he had inserted between his teeth,&mdash;"I hears as how
      you be unkimmon fond of reading. I ha' sum nice cheap books in my bag
      yonder,&mdash;sum as low as a penny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see them," said Lenny, his eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinker rose, opened one of the panniers on the ass's back, took out a
      bag, which he placed before Lenny, and told him to suit himself. The young
      peasant desired no better. He spread all the contents of the bag on the
      sward, and a motley collection of food for the mind was there,&mdash;food
      and poison, serpentes avibus good and evil. Here Milton's Paradise Lost,
      there "The Age of Reason;" here Methodist Tracts, there "True Principles
      of Socialism,"&mdash;Treatises on Useful Knowledge by sound learning
      actuated by pure benevolence, Appeals to Operatives by the shallowest
      reasoners, instigated by the same ambition that had moved Eratosthenes to
      the conflagration of a temple; works of fiction admirable as "Robinson
      Crusoe," or innocent as "The Old English Baron," beside coarse
      translations of such garbage as had rotted away the youth of France under
      Louis Quinze. This miscellany was an epitome, in short, of the mixed World
      of Books, of that vast city of the Press, with its palaces and hovels, its
      aqueducts and sewers, which opens all alike to the naked eye and the
      curious mind of him to whom you say, in the tinker's careless phrase,
      "Suit yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is not the first impulse of a nature healthful and still pure to
      settle in the hovel and lose itself amidst the sewers; and Lenny Fairfield
      turned innocently over the bad books, and selecting two or three of the
      best, brought them to the tinker, and asked the price.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Mr. Sprott, putting on his spectacles, "you has taken the
      werry dearest: them 'ere be much cheaper, and more hinterestin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't fancy them," answered Lenny; "I don't understand what they
      are about, and this seems to tell one how the steam-engine is made, and
      has nice plates; and this is 'Robinson Crusoe,' which Parson Dale once
      said he would give me&mdash;I'd rather buy it out of my own money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, please yourself," quoth the tinker; "you shall have the books for
      four bob, and you can pay me next month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four bobs, four shillings? it is a great sum," said Lenny; "but I will
      lay by, as you are kind enough to trust me: good-evening, Mr. Sprott."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay a bit," said the tinker; "I'll just throw you these two little
      tracts into the bargain; they be only a shilling a dozen, so 't is but
      tuppence,&mdash;and ven you has read those, vy, you'll be a regular
      customer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinker tossed to Lenny Nos. 1 and 2 of "Appeals to Operatives," and
      the peasant took them up gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young knowledge-seeker went his way across the green fields, and under
      the still autumn foliage of the hedgerows. He looked first at one book,
      then at another; he did not know on which to settle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinker rose, and made a fire with leaves and furze and sticks, some
      dry and some green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny has now opened No. 1 of the tracts: they are the shortest to read,
      and don't require so much effort of the mind as the explanation of the
      steam-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinker has set on his grimy glue-pot, and the glue simmers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Violante became more familiar with her new home, and those around her
      became more familiar with Violante, she was remarked for a certain
      stateliness of manner and bearing, which, had it been less evidently
      natural and inborn, would have seemed misplaced in the daughter of a
      forlorn exile, and would have been rare at so early an age among children
      of the loftiest pretensions. It was with the air of a little princess that
      she presented her tiny hand to a friendly pressure, or submitted her calm
      clear cheek to a presuming kiss. Yet withal she was so graceful, and her
      very stateliness was so pretty and captivating, that she was not the less
      loved for all her grand airs. And, indeed, she deserved to be loved; for
      though she was certainly prouder than Mr. Dale could approve of, her pride
      was devoid of egotism,&mdash;and that is a pride by no means common. She
      had an intuitive forethought for others: you could see that she was
      capable of that grand woman-heroism, abnegation of self; and though she
      was an original child, and often grave and musing, with a tinge of
      melancholy, sweet, but deep in her character, still she was not above the
      happy genial merriment of childhood,&mdash;only her silver laugh was more
      attuned, and her gestures more composed, than those of children habituated
      to many play-fellows usually are. Mrs. Hazeldean liked her best when she
      was grave, and said "she would become a very sensible woman." Mrs. Dale
      liked her best when she was gay, and said "she was born to make many a
      heart ache;" for which Mrs. Dale was properly reproved by the parson. Mrs.
      Hazeldean gave her a little set of garden tools; Mrs. Dale a picture-book
      and a beautiful doll. For a long time the book and the doll had the
      preference. But Mrs. Hazeldean having observed to Riccabocca that the poor
      child looked pale, and ought to be a good deal in the open air, the wise
      father ingeniously pretended to Violante that Mrs. Riccabocca had taken a
      great fancy to the picture-book, and that he should be very glad to have
      the doll, upon which Violante hastened to give them both away, and was
      never so happy as when Mamma (as she called Mrs. Riccabocca) was admiring
      the picture-book, and Riccabocca with austere gravity dandled the doll.
      Then Riccabocca assured her that she could be of great use to him in the
      garden; and Violante instantly put into movement her spade, hoe, and
      wheelbarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last occupation brought her into immediate contact with Mr. Leonard
      Fairfield; and that personage one morning, to his great horror, found Miss
      Violante had nearly exterminated a whole celery-bed, which she had
      ignorantly conceived to be a crop of weeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny was extremely angry. He snatched away the hoe, and said angrily,
      "You must not do that, Miss. I'll tell your papa if you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante drew herself up, and never having been so spoken to before, at
      least since her arrival in England, there was something comic in the
      surprise of her large eyes, as well as something tragic in the dignity of
      her offended mien. "It is very naughty of you, Miss," continued Leonard,
      in a milder tone, for he was both softened by the eyes and awed by the
      mien, "and I trust you will not do it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Non capisco," murmured Violante, and the dark eyes filled with tears. At
      that moment up came Jackeymo: and Violante, pointing to Leonard, said,
      with an effort not to betray her emotion, "Il fanciullo e molto
      grossolano."&mdash;["He is a very rude boy."]
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo turned to Leonard with the look of an enraged tiger. "How you
      dare, scum of de earth that you are," cried he, "how you dare make cry the
      signorina?" And his English not supplying familiar vituperatives
      sufficiently, he poured out upon Lenny such a profusion of Italian abuse,
      that the boy turned red and white, in a breath, with rage and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante took instant compassion upon the victim she had made, and with
      true feminine caprice now began to scold Jackeymo for his anger, and,
      finally approaching Leonard, laid her hand on his arm, and said with a
      kindness at once childlike and queenly, and in the prettiest imaginable
      mixture of imperfect English and soft Italian, to which I cannot pretend
      to do justice, and shall therefore translate: "Don't mind him. I dare say
      it was all my fault, only I did not understand you: are not these things
      weeds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my darling signorina," said Jackeymo in Italian, looking ruefully at
      the celery-bed, "they are not weeds, and they sell very well at this time
      of the year. But still, if it amuses you to pluck them up, I should like
      to see who's to prevent it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny walked away. He had been called "the scum of the earth,"&mdash;by a
      foreigner too! He had again been ill-treated for doing what he conceived
      his duty. He was again feeling the distinction between rich and poor, and
      he now fancied that that distinction involved deadly warfare, for he had
      read from beginning to end those two damnable tracts which the tinker had
      presented to him. But in the midst of all the angry disturbance of his
      mind, he felt the soft touch of the infant's hand, the soothing influence
      of her conciliating words, and he was half ashamed that he had spoken so
      roughly to a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, not trusting himself to speak, he walked away, and sat down at a
      distance: "I don't see," thought he, "why there should be rich and poor,
      master and servant." Lenny, be it remembered, had not heard the Parson's
      Political Sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after, having composed himself, Lenny returned to his work.
      Jackeymo was no longer in the garden: he had gone to the fields; but
      Riccabocca was standing by the celerybed, and holding the red silk
      umbrella over Violante as she sat on the ground, looking up at her father
      with those eyes already so full of intelligence and love and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lenny," said Riccabocca, "my young lady has been telling me that she has
      been very naughty, and Giacomo very unjust to you. Forgive them both."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny's sullenness melted in an instant: the reminiscences of tracts Nos.
      1 and 2,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Like the baseless fabric of a vision,
          Left not a wreck behind."
</pre>
    <p>
      He raised eyes swimming with all his native goodness towards the wise man,
      and dropped them gratefully on the infant peace-maker. Then he turned away
      his head and fairly wept. The parson was right: "O ye poor, have charity
      for the rich; O ye rich, respect the poor."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now from that day the humble Lenny and the regal Violante became great
      friends. With what pride he taught her to distinguish between celery and
      weeds,&mdash;and how proud too was she when she learned that she was
      useful! There is not a greater pleasure you can give children, especially
      female children, than to make them feel they are already of value in the
      world, and serviceable as well as protected. Weeks and months rolled away,
      and Lenny still read, not only the books lent him by the doctor, but those
      he bought of Mr. Sprott. As for the bombs and shells against religion
      which the tinker carried in his bag, Lenny was not induced to blow himself
      up with them. He had been reared from his cradle in simple love and
      reverence for the Divine Father, and the tender Saviour, whose life beyond
      all records of human goodness, whose death beyond all epics of mortal
      heroism, no being whose infancy has been taught to supplicate the Merciful
      and adore the Holy, yea, even though his later life may be entangled
      amidst the thorns of some desolate pyrrhonism, can ever hear reviled and
      scoffed without a shock to the conscience and a revolt of the heart. As
      the deer recoils by instinct from the tiger, as the very look of the
      scorpion deters you from handling it, though you never saw a scorpion
      before, so the very first line in some ribald profanity on which the
      tinker put his black finger made Lenny's blood run cold. Safe, too, was
      the peasant boy from any temptation in works of a gross and licentious
      nature, not only because of the happy ignorance of his rural life, but
      because of a more enduring safeguard,&mdash;genius! Genius, that, manly,
      robust, healthful as it be, is long before it lose its instinctive Dorian
      modesty; shamefaced, because so susceptible to glory,&mdash;genius, that
      loves indeed to dream, but on the violet bank, not the dunghill.
      Wherefore, even in the error of the senses, it seeks to escape from the
      sensual into worlds of fancy, subtle and refined. But apart from the
      passions, true genius is the most practical of all human gifts. Like the
      Apollo, whom the Greek worshipped as its type, even Arcady is its exile,
      not its home. Soon weary of the dalliance of Tempe, it ascends to its
      mission,&mdash;the Archer of the silver bow, the guide of the car of
      light. Speaking more plainly, genius is the enthusiasm for
      self-improvement; it ceases or sleeps the moment it desists from seeking
      some object which it believes of value, and by that object it insensibly
      connects its self-improvement with the positive advance of the world. At
      present Lenny's genius had no bias that was not to the Positive and
      Useful. It took the direction natural to its sphere, and the wants
      therein,&mdash;namely, to the arts which we call mechanical. He wanted to
      know about steam-engines and Artesian wells; and to know about them it was
      necessary to know something of mechanics and hydrostatics; so he bought
      popular elementary works on those mystic sciences, and set all the powers
      of his mind at work on experiments.

    <p>
      Noble and generous spirits are ye, who, with small care for fame, and
      little reward from pelf, have opened to the intellects of the poor the
      portals of wisdom! I honour and revere ye; only do not think ye have done
      all that is needful. Consider, I pray ye, whether so good a choice from
      the tinker's bag would have been made by a boy whom religion had not
      scared from the Pestilent, and genius had not led to the self-improving.
      And Lenny did not wholly escape from the mephitic portions of the motley
      elements from which his awakening mind drew its nurture. Think not it was
      all pure oxygen that the panting lip drew in. No; there were still those
      inflammatory tracts. Political I do not like to call them, for politics
      means the art of government, and the tracts I speak of assailed all
      government which mankind has hitherto recognized. Sad rubbish, perhaps,
      were such tracts to you, O sound thinker, in your easy-chair! or to you,
      practised statesman, at your post on the Treasury Bench; to you, calm
      dignitary of a learned Church; or to you, my lord judge, who may often
      have sent from your bar to the dire Orcus of Norfolk's Isle the ghosts of
      men whom that rubbish, falling simultaneously on the bumps of
      acquisitiveness and combativeness, hath untimely slain! Sad rubbish to
      you! But seems it such rubbish to the poor man, to whom it promises a
      paradise on the easy terms of upsetting a world? For, ye see, those
      "Appeals to Operatives" represent that same world-upsetting as the
      simplest thing imaginable,&mdash;a sort of two-and-two-make-four
      proposition. The poor have only got to set their strong hands to the axle,
      and heave-a-boy! and hurrah for the topsy-turvy! Then just to put a little
      wholesome rage into the heave-a-hoy! it is so facile to accompany the
      eloquence of "Appeals" with a kind of stir-the-bile-up statistics,&mdash;"Abuses
      of the aristocracy," "Jobs of the Priesthood," "Expenses of the Army kept
      up for Peers' younger sons," "Wars contracted for the villanous purpose of
      raising the rents of the landowners,"&mdash;all arithmetically dished up,
      and seasoned with tales of every gentleman who has committed a misdeed,
      every clergyman who has dishonoured his cloth; as if such instances were
      fair specimens of average gentlemen and ministers of religion! All this,
      passionately advanced (and, observe, never answered, for that literature
      admits no controversialists, and the writer has it all his own way), may
      be rubbish; but it is out of such rubbish that operatives build barricades
      for attack, and legislators prisons for defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our poor friend Lenny drew plenty of this stuff from the tinker's bag. He
      thought it very clever and very eloquent; and he supposed the statistics
      were as true as mathematical demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A famous knowledge-diffuser is looking over my shoulder, and tells me,
      "Increase education, and cheapen good books, and all this rubbish will
      disappear!" Sir, I don't believe a word of it. If you printed Ricardo and
      Adam Smith at a farthing a volume, I still believe that they would be as
      little read by the operatives as they are nowadays by a very large
      proportion of highly-cultivated men. I still believe that, while the press
      works, attacks on the rich and propositions for heave-a-hoys will always
      form a popular portion of the Literature of Labour. There's Lenny
      Fairfield reading a treatise on hydraulics, and constructing a model for a
      fountain into the bargain; but that does not prevent his acquiescence in
      any proposition for getting rid of a National Debt, which he certainly
      never agreed to pay, and which he is told makes sugar and tea so
      shamefully dear. No. I tell you what does a little counteract those
      eloquent incentives to break his own head against the strong walls of the
      Social System,&mdash;it is, that he has two eyes in that head which are
      not always employed in reading. And having been told in print that masters
      are tyrants, parsons hypocrites or drones in the hive, and landowners
      vampires and bloodsuckers, he looks out into the little world around him,
      and, first, he is compelled to acknowledge that his master is not a tyrant
      (perhaps because he is a foreigner and a philosopher, and, for what I and
      Lenny know, a republican). But then Parson Dale, though High Church to the
      marrow, is neither hypocrite nor drone. He has a very good living, it is
      true,&mdash;much better than he ought to have, according to the
      "political" opinions of those tracts! but Lenny is obliged to confess that
      if Parson Dale were a penny the poorer, he would do a pennyworth's less
      good; and comparing one parish with another, such as Rood Hall and
      Hazeldean, he is dimly aware that there is no greater CIVILIZER than a
      parson tolerably well off. Then, too, Squire Hazeldean, though as arrant a
      Tory as ever stood upon shoe-leather, is certainly not a vampire nor blood
      sucker. He does not feed on the public; a great many of the public feed
      upon him: and, therefore, his practical experience a little staggers and
      perplexes Lenny Fairfield as to the gospel accuracy of his theoretical
      dogmas. Masters, parsons, and landowners! having, at the risk of all
      popularity, just given a coup de patte to certain sages extremely the
      fashion at present, I am not going to let you off without an admonitory
      flea in the ear. Don't suppose that any mere scribbling and typework will
      suffice to answer the scribbling and typework set at work to demolish you,&mdash;write
      down that rubbish you can't; live it down you may. If you are rich, like
      Squire Hazeldean, do good with your money; if you are poor, like Signor
      Riccabocca, do good with your kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      See! there is Lenny now receiving his week's wages; and though Lenny knows
      that he can get higher wages in the very next parish, his blue eyes are
      sparkling with gratitude, not at the chink of the money, but at the poor
      exile's friendly talk on things apart from all service; while Violante is
      descending the steps from the terrace, charged by her mother-in-law with a
      little basket of sago, and such-like delicacies, for Mrs. Fairfield, who
      has been ailing the last few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny will see the tinker as he goes home, and he will buy a most
      Demosthenean "Appeal,"&mdash;a tract of tracts, upon the propriety of
      Strikes and the Avarice of Masters. But, somehow or other, I think a few
      words from Signor Riccabocca, that did not cost the signor a farthing, and
      the sight of his mother's smile at the contents of the basket, which cost
      very little, will serve to neutralize the effects of that "Appeal" much
      more efficaciously than the best article a Brougham or a Mill could write
      on the subject.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Spring had come again; and one beautiful May day, Leonard Fairfield sat
      beside the little fountain which he had now actually constructed in the
      garden. The butterflies were hovering over the belt of flowers which he
      had placed around his fountain, and the birds were singing overhead.
      Leonard Fairfield was resting from his day's work, to enjoy his abstemious
      dinner, beside the cool play of the sparkling waters, and, with the yet
      keener appetite of knowledge, he devoured his book as he munched his
      crusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      A penny tract is the shoeing-horn of literature! it draws on a great many
      books, and some too tight to be very useful in walking. The penny tract
      quotes a celebrated writer&mdash;you long to read him; it props a
      startling assertion by a grave authority&mdash;you long to refer to it.
      During the nights of the past winter, Leonard's intelligence had made vast
      progress; he had taught himself more than the elements of mechanics, and
      put to practice the principles he had acquired not only in the hydraulical
      achievement of the fountain, nor in the still more notable application of
      science, commenced on the stream in which Jackeymo had fished for minnows,
      and which Lenny had diverted to the purpose of irrigating two fields, but
      in various ingenious contrivances for the facilitation or abridgment of
      labour, which had excited great wonder and praise in the neighbourhood. On
      the other hand, those rabid little tracts, which dealt so summarily with
      the destinies of the human race, even when his growing reason and the
      perusal of works more classical or more logical had led him to perceive
      that they were illiterate, and to suspect that they jumped from premises
      to conclusions with a celerity very different from the careful
      ratiocination of mechanical science, had still, in the citations and
      references wherewith they abounded, lured him on to philosophers more
      specious and more perilous. Out of the tinker's bag he had drawn a
      translation of Condorcet's "Progress of Man" and another of Rousseau's
      "Social Contract." Works so eloquent had induced him to select from the
      tracts in the tinker's miscellany those which abounded most in professions
      of philanthropy, and predictions of some coming Golden Age, to which old
      Saturn's was a joke,&mdash;tracts so mild and mother-like in their
      language, that it required a much more practical experience than Lenny's
      to perceive that you would have to pass a river of blood before you had
      the slightest chance of setting foot on the flowery banks on which they
      invited you to repose; tracts which rouged poor Christianity on the
      cheeks, clapped a crown of innocent daffodillies on her head, and set her
      to dancing a pas de zephyr in the pastoral ballet in which Saint-Simon
      pipes to the flock he shears; or having first laid it down as a
      preliminary axiom that&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,
     The solemn temples, the great globe itself,&mdash;
     Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,"
</pre>
    <p>
      substituted in place thereof M. Fourier's symmetrical phalanstere, or Mr.
      Owen's architectural parallelogram. It was with some such tract that Lenny
      was seasoning his crusts and his radishes, when Riccabocca, bending his
      long dark face over the student's shoulder, said abruptly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diavolo, my friend! what on earth have you got there? Just let me look at
      it, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard rose respectfully, and coloured deeply as he surrendered the tract
      to Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise man read the first page attentively, the second more cursorily,
      and only ran his eye over the rest. He had gone through too vast a range
      of problems political, not to have passed over that venerable Pons
      Asinorum of Socialism, on which Fouriers and Saint-Simons sit straddling,
      and cry aloud that they have arrived at the last boundary of knowledge!
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this is as old as the hills," quoth Riccabocca, irreverently; "but
      the hills stand still, and this&mdash;there it goes!" and the sage pointed
      to a cloud emitted from his pipe. "Did you ever read Sir David Brewster on
      Optical Delusions? No! Well, I'll lend it to you. You will find therein a
      story of a lady who always saw a black cat on her hearth-rug. The black
      cat existed only in her fancy, but the hallucination was natural and
      reasonable,&mdash;eh, what do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir," said Leonard, not catching the Italian's meaning, "I don't
      exactly see that it was natural and reasonable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foolish boy, yes! because black cats are things possible and known. But
      who ever saw upon earth a community of men such as sit on the hearth-rugs
      of Messrs. Owen and Fourier? If the lady's hallucination was not
      reasonable, what is his who believes in such visions as these?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," cried Riccabocca, kindly, "the only thing sure and tangible
      to which these writers would lead you lies at the first step, and that is
      what is commonly called a Revolution. Now, I know what that is. I have
      gone, not indeed through a revolution, but an attempt at one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard raised his eyes towards his master with a look of profound respect
      and great curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," added Riccabocca, and the face on which the boy gazed exchanged its
      usual grotesque and sardonic expression for one animated, noble, and
      heroic. "Yes, not a revolution for chimeras, but for that cause which the
      coldest allow to be good, and which, when successful, all time approves as
      divine,&mdash;the redemption of our native soil from the rule of the
      foreigner! I have shared in such an attempt. And," continued the Italian,
      mournfully, "recalling now all the evil passions it arouses, all the ties
      it dissolves, all the blood that it commands to flow, all the healthful
      industry it arrests, all the madmen that it arms, all the victims that it
      dupes, I question whether one man really honest, pure, and humane, who has
      once gone through such an ordeal, would ever hazard it again, unless he
      was assured that the victory was certain,&mdash;ay, and the object for
      which he fights not to be wrested from his hands amidst the uproar of the
      elements that the battle has released."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian paused, shaded his brow with his hand, and remained long
      silent. Then, gradually resuming his ordinary tone, he continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revolutions that have no definite objects made clear by the positive
      experience of history; revolutions, in a word, that aim less at
      substituting one law or one dynasty for another, than at changing the
      whole scheme of society, have been little attempted by real statesmen.
      Even Lycurgus is proved to be a myth who never existed. Such organic
      changes are but in the day-dreams of philosophers who lived apart from the
      actual world, and whose opinions (though generally they were very
      benevolent, good sort of men, and wrote in an elegant poetical style) one
      would no more take on a plain matter of life, than one would look upon
      Virgil's Eclogues as a faithful picture of the ordinary pains and
      pleasures of the peasants who tend our sheep. Read them as you would read
      poets, and they are delightful. But attempt to shape the world according
      to the poetry, and fit yourself for a madhouse. The farther off the age is
      from the realization of such projects, the more these poor philosophers
      have indulged them. Thus, it was amidst the saddest corruption of court
      manners that it became the fashion in Paris to sit for one's picture with
      a crook in one's hand, as Alexis or Daphne. Just as liberty was fast dying
      out of Greece, and the successors of Alexander were founding their
      monarchies, and Rome was growing up to crush in its iron grasp all States
      save its own, Plato withdraws his eyes from the world, to open them in his
      dreamy "Atlantis." Just in the grimmest period of English history, with
      the axe hanging over his head, Sir Thomas More gives you his "Utopia."
      Just when the world is to be the theatre of a new Sesostris, the sages of
      France tell you that the age is too enlightened for war, that man is
      henceforth to be governed by pure reason, and live in a paradise. Very
      pretty reading all this to a man like me, Lenny, who can admire and smile
      at it. But to you, to the man who has to work for his living, to the man
      who thinks it would be so much more pleasant to live at his ease in a
      phalanstere than to work eight or ten hours a day; to the man of talent
      and action and industry, whose future is invested in that tranquillity and
      order of a State in which talent and action and industry are a certain
      capital,&mdash;why, Messrs. Coutts, the great bankers, had better
      encourage a theory to upset the system of banking! Whatever disturbs
      society, yea, even by a causeless panic, much more by an actual struggle,
      falls first upon the market of labour, and thence affects prejudicially
      every department of intelligence. In such times the arts are arrested;
      literature is neglected; people are too busy to read anything save appeals
      to their passions. And capital, shaken in its sense of security, no longer
      ventures boldly through the land, calling forth all the energies of toil
      and enterprise, and extending to every workman his reward. Now, Lenny,
      take this piece of advice. You are young, clever, and aspiring: men rarely
      succeed in changing the world; but a man seldom fails of success if he
      lets the world alone, and resolves to make the best of it. You are in the
      midst of the great crisis of your life; it is the struggle between the new
      desires knowledge excites, and that sense of poverty which those desires
      convert either into hope and emulation, or into envy and despair. I grant
      that it is an up-hill work that lies before you; but don't you think it is
      always easier to climb a mountain than it is to level it? These books call
      on you to level the mountain; and that mountain is the property of other
      people, subdivided amongst a great many proprietors, and protected by law.
      At the first stroke of the pickaxe, it is ten to one but what you are
      taken up for a trespass. But the path up the mountain is a right of way
      uncontested. You may be safe at the summit, before (even if the owners are
      fools enough to let you) you could have levelled a yard. Cospetto!" quoth
      the doctor, "it is more than two thousand years ago since poor Plato began
      to level it, and the mountain is as high as ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, Riccabocca came to the end of his pipe, and stalking
      thoughtfully away, he left Leonard Fairfield trying to extract light from
      the smoke.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly after this discourse of Riccabocca's, an incident occurred to
      Leonard that served to carry his mind into new directions. One evening,
      when his mother was out, he was at work on a new mechanical contrivance,
      and had the misfortune to break one of the instruments which he employed.
      Now it will be remembered that his father had been the squire's head
      carpenter: the widow had carefully hoarded the tools of his craft, which
      had belonged to her poor Mark; and though she occasionally lent them to
      Leonard, she would not give them up to his service. Amongst these Leonard
      knew that he should find the one that he wanted; and being much interested
      in his contrivance, he could not wait till his mother's return. The tools,
      with other little relies of the lost, were kept in a large trunk in Mrs.
      Fairfield's sleepingroom; the trunk was not locked, and Leonard went to it
      with out ceremony or scruple. In rummaging for the instrument his eye fell
      upon a bundle of manuscripts; and he suddenly recollected that when he was
      a mere child, and before he much knew the difference between verse and
      prose, his mother had pointed to these manuscripts, and said, "One day or
      other, when you can read nicely, I'll let you look at these, Lenny. My
      poor Mark wrote such verses&mdash;ah, he was a schollard!" Leonard,
      reasonably enough, thought that the time had now arrived when he was
      worthy the privilege of reading the paternal effusions, and he took forth
      the manuscripts with a keen but melancholy interest. He recognized his
      father's handwriting, which he had often seen before in account-books and
      memoranda, and read eagerly some trifling poems, which did not show much
      genius, nor much mastery of language and rhythm,&mdash;such poems, in
      short, as a self-educated man, with poetic taste and feeling rather than
      poetic inspiration or artistic culture, might compose with credit, but not
      for fame. But suddenly, as he turned over these "Occasional Pieces,"
      Leonard came to others in a different handwriting,&mdash;a woman's
      handwriting, small and fine and exquisitely formed. He had scarcely read
      six lines of these last, before his attention was irresistibly chained.
      They were of a different order of merit from poor Mark's; they bore the
      unmistakable stamp of genius. Like the poetry of women in general, they
      were devoted to personal feeling,&mdash;they were not the mirror of a
      world, but reflections of a solitary heart. Yet this is the kind of poetry
      most pleasing to the young. And the verses in question had another
      attraction for Leonard: they seemed to express some struggle akin to his
      own,&mdash;some complaint against the actual condition of the writer's
      life, some sweet melodious murmurs at fortune. For the rest, they were
      characterized by a vein of sentiment so elevated, that, if written by a
      man, it would have run into exaggeration; written by a woman, the romance
      was carried off by so many genuine revelations of sincere, deep, pathetic
      feeling, that it was always natural, though true to a nature for which you
      would not augur happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was still absorbed in the perusal of these poems when Mrs.
      Fairfield entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you been about, Lenny,&mdash;searching in my box?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came to look for my father's bag of tools, Mother, and I found these
      papers, which you said I might read some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I does n't wonder you did not hear me when I came in," said the widow,
      sighing. "I used to sit still for the hour together, when my poor Mark
      read his poems to me. There was such a pretty one about the 'Peasant's
      Fireside,' Lenny,&mdash;have you got hold of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear mother; and I remarked the allusion to you: it brought tears to
      my eyes. But these verses are not my father's; whose are they? They seem
      in a woman's handwriting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fairfield looked, changed colour, grew faint and seated herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor, poor Nora!" said she, falteringly. "I did not know as they were
      there; Mark kep' 'em; they got among his&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"Who was Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FAIRFIELD.&mdash;"Who?&mdash;child&mdash;who? Nora was&mdash;was my
      own&mdash;own sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (in great amaze, contrasting his ideal of the writer of these
      musical lines, in that graceful hand, with his homely uneducated mother,
      who could neither read nor write).&mdash;"Your sister! is it possible! My
      aunt, then. How comes it you never spoke of her before? Oh, you should be
      so proud of her, Mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FAIRFIELD (clasping her hands).&mdash;"We were proud of her, all of
      us,&mdash;father, mother, all! She was so beautiful and so good, and not
      proud she! though she looked like the first lady in the land. Oh, Nora,
      Nora!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (after a pause).&mdash;"But she must have been highly educated?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FAIRFIELD.&mdash;"'Deed she was!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"How was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FAIRFIELD (rocking herself to and fro in her chair).&mdash;"Oh, my
      Lady was her godmother,&mdash;Lady Lansmere I mean,&mdash;and took a fancy
      to her when she was that high, and had her to stay at the Park, and wait
      on her Ladyship; and then she put her to school, and Nora was so clever
      that nothing would do but she must go to London as a governess. But don't
      talk of it, boy! don't talk of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"Why not, Mother? What has become of her; where is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. FAIRFIELD (bursting into a paroxysm of tears).&mdash;"In her grave,&mdash;in
      her cold grave! Dead, dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was inexpressibly grieved and shocked. It is the attribute of the
      poet to seem always living, always a friend. Leonard felt as if some one
      very dear had been suddenly torn from his heart. He tried to console his
      mother; but her emotion was contagious, and he wept with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how long has she been dead?" he asked at last, in mournful accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many's the long year, many; but," added Mrs. Fairfield, rising, and
      putting her tremulous hand on Leonard's shoulder, "you'll just never talk
      to me about her; I can't bear it, it breaks my heart. I can bear better to
      talk of Mark; come downstairs,&mdash;come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I not keep these verses, Mother? Do let me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, those bits o' paper be all she left behind her,&mdash;yes,
      keep them, but put back Mark's. Are they all here,&mdash;sure?" And the
      widow, though she could not read her husband's verses, looked jealously at
      the manuscripts written in his irregular, large scrawl, and, smoothing
      them carefully, replaced them in the trunk, and resettled over them some
      sprigs of lavender, which Leonard had unwittingly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Leonard, as his eye again rested on the beautiful handwriting
      of his lost aunt,&mdash;"but you called her Nora&mdash;I see she signs
      herself L."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leonora was her name. I said she was my Lady's god-child. We call her
      Nora for short&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leonora&mdash;and I am Leonard&mdash;is that how I came by the name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; do hold your tongue, boy," sobbed poor Mrs. Fairfield; and she
      could not be soothed nor coaxed into continuing or renewing a subject
      which was evidently associated with insupportable pain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is difficult to exaggerate the effect that this discovery produced on
      Leonard's train of thought. Some one belonging to his own humble race had,
      then, preceded him in his struggling flight towards the loftier regions of
      Intelligence and Desire. It was like the mariner amidst unknown seas, who
      finds carved upon some desert isle a familiar household name.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this creature of genius and of sorrow-whose existence he had only
      learned by her song, and whose death created, in the simple heart of her
      sister, so passionate a grief, after the lapse of so many years&mdash;supplied
      to the romance awaking in his young heart the ideal which it unconsciously
      sought. He was pleased to hear that she had been beautiful and good. He
      paused from his books to muse on her, and picture her image to his fancy.
      That there was some mystery in her fate was evident to him; and while that
      conviction deepened his interest, the mystery itself by degrees took a
      charm which he was not anxious to dispel. He resigned himself to Mrs.
      Fairfield's obstinate silence. He was contented to rank the dead amongst
      those holy and ineffable images which we do not seek to unveil. Youth and
      Fancy have many secret hoards of idea which they do not desire to impart,
      even to those most in their confidence. I doubt the depth of feeling in
      any man who has not certain recesses in his soul into which none may
      enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, as I have said, the talents of Leonard Fairfield had been more
      turned to things positive than to the ideal,&mdash;to science and
      investigation of fact than to poetry, and that airier truth in which
      poetry has its element. He had read our greater poets, indeed, but without
      thought of imitating; and rather from the general curiosity to inspect all
      celebrated monuments of the human mind than from that especial
      predilection for verse which is too common in childhood and youth to be
      any sure sign of a poet. But now these melodies, unknown to all the world
      beside, rang in his ear, mingled with his thoughts,&mdash;set, as it were,
      his whole life to music. He read poetry with a different sentiment,&mdash;it
      seemed to him that he had discovered its secret. And so reading, the
      passion seized him, and "the numbers came."
    </p>
    <p>
      To many minds, at the commencement of our grave and earnest pilgrimage, I
      am Vandal enough to think that the indulgence of poetic taste and revery
      does great and lasting harm; that it serves to enervate the character,
      give false ideas of life, impart the semblance of drudgery to the noble
      toils and duties of the active man. All poetry would not do this,&mdash;not,
      for instance, the Classical, in its diviner masters; not the poetry of
      Homer, of Virgil, of Sophocles; not, perhaps, even that of the indolent
      Horace. But the poetry which youth usually loves and appreciates the best&mdash;the
      poetry of mere sentiment&mdash;does so in minds already over-predisposed
      to the sentimental, and which require bracing to grow into healthful
      manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, even this latter kind of poetry, which is peculiarly
      modern, does suit many minds of another mould,&mdash;minds which our
      modern life, with its hard positive forms, tends to produce. And as in
      certain climates plants and herbs, peculiarly adapted as antidotes to
      those diseases most prevalent in the atmosphere, are profusely sown, as it
      were, by the benignant providence of Nature, so it may be that the softer
      and more romantic species of poetry, which comes forth in harsh,
      money-making, unromantic times, is intended as curatives and
      counter-poisons. The world is so much with us, nowadays, that we need have
      something that prates to us, albeit even in too fine a euphuism, of the
      moon and stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certes, to Leonard Fairfield, at that period of his intellectual life, the
      softness of our Helicon descended as healing dews. In his turbulent and
      unsettled ambition, in his vague grapple with the giant forms of political
      truths, in his bias towards the application of science to immediate
      practical purposes, this lovely vision of the Muse came in the white robe
      of the Peacemaker; and with upraised hand pointing to serene skies, she
      opened to him fair glimpses of the Beautiful, which is given to Peasant as
      to Prince,&mdash;showed to him that on the surface of earth there is
      something nobler than fortune, that he who can view the world as a poet is
      always at soul a king; while to practical purpose itself, that larger and
      more profound invention, which poetry stimulates, supplied the grand
      design and the subtle view,&mdash;leading him beyond the mere ingenuity of
      the mechanic, and habituating him to regard the inert force of the matter
      at his command with the ambition of the Discoverer. But, above all, the
      discontent that was within him finding a vent, not in deliberate war upon
      this actual world, but through the purifying channels of song, in the vent
      itself it evaporated, it was lost. By accustoming ourselves to survey all
      things with the spirit that retains and reproduces them only in their
      lovelier or grander aspects, a vast philosophy of toleration for what we
      before gazed on with scorn or hate insensibly grows upon us. Leonard
      looked into his heart after the Enchantress had breathed upon it; and
      through the mists of the fleeting and tender melancholy which betrayed
      where she had been, he beheld a new sun of delight and joy dawning over
      the landscape of human life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, though she was dead and gone from his actual knowledge, this
      mysterious kinswoman&mdash;"a voice, and nothing more"&mdash;had spoken to
      him, soothed, elevated, cheered, attuned each discord into harmony; and if
      now permitted from some serener sphere to behold the life that her soul
      thus strangely influenced, verily with yet holier joy the saving and
      lovely spirit might have glided onward in the Eternal Progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      We call the large majority of human lives obscure. Presumptuous that we
      are! How know we what lives a single thought retained from the dust of
      nameless graves may have lighted to renown?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was about a year after Leonard's discovery of the family manuscripts
      that Parson Dale borrowed the quietest pad-mare in the squire's stables,
      and set out on an equestrian excursion. He said that he was bound on
      business connected with his old parishioners of Lansmere; for, as it has
      been incidentally implied in a previous chapter, he had been connected
      with that borough town (and, I may here add, in the capacity of curate)
      before he had been inducted into the living of Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so rarely that the parson stirred from home, that this journey to a
      town more than twenty miles off was regarded as a most daring adventure,
      both at the Hall and at the Parsonage. Mrs. Dale could not sleep the whole
      previous night with thinking of it; and though she had naturally one of
      her worst nervous headaches on the eventful morn, she yet suffered no
      hands less thoughtful than her own to pack up the saddle-bags which the
      parson had borrowed along with the pad. Nay, so distrustful was she of the
      possibility of the good man's exerting the slightest common-sense in her
      absence, that she kept him close at her side while she was engaged in that
      same operation of packing-up,&mdash;showing him the exact spot in which
      the clean shirt was put; and how nicely the old slippers were packed up in
      one of his own sermons. She implored him not to mistake the sandwiches for
      his shaving-soap, and made him observe how carefully she had provided
      against such confusion, by placing them as far apart from each other as
      the nature of saddle-bags will admit. The poor parson&mdash;who was really
      by no means an absent man, but as little likely to shave himself with
      sandwiches and lunch upon soap as the most commonplace mortal may be&mdash;listened
      with conjugal patience, and thought that man never had such a wife before;
      nor was it without tears in his own eyes that he tore himself from the
      farewell embrace of his weeping Carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess, however, that it was with some apprehension that he set his
      foot in the stirrup, and trusted his person to the mercies of an
      unfamiliar animal. For, whatever might be Mr. Dale's minor accomplishments
      as man and parson, horsemanship was not his forte. Indeed, I doubt if he
      had taken the reins in his hand more than twice since he had been married.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire's surly old groom, Mat, was in attendance with the pad; and, to
      the parson's gentle inquiry whether Mat was quite sure that the pad was
      quite safe, replied laconically, "Oi, oi; give her her head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give her her head!" repeated Mr. Dale, rather amazed, for he had not the
      slightest intention of taking away that part of the beast's frame, so
      essential to its vital economy,&mdash;"give her her head!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oi, oi; and don't jerk her up like that, or she'll fall a doincing on her
      hind-legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson instantly slackened the reins; and Mrs. Dale&mdash;who had
      tarried behind to control her tears&mdash;now running to the door for
      "more last words," he waved his hand with courageous amenity, and ambled
      forth into the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our equestrian was absorbed at first in studying the idiosyncrasies of the
      pad-mare, and trying thereby to arrive at some notion of her general
      character: guessing, for instance, why she raised one ear and laid down
      the other; why she kept bearing so close to the left that she brushed his
      leg against the hedge; and why, when she arrived at a little side-gate in
      the fields, which led towards the home-farm, she came to a full stop, and
      fell to rubbing her nose against the rail,&mdash;an occupation from which
      the parson, finding all civil remonstrances in vain, at length diverted
      her by a timorous application of the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      This crisis on the road fairly passed, the pad seemed to comprehend that
      she had a journey before her, and giving a petulant whisk of her tail,
      quickened her amble into a short trot, which soon brought the parson into
      the high road, and nearly opposite the Casino.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, sitting on the gate which led to his abode, and shaded by his
      umbrella, he beheld Dr. Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian lifted his eyes from the book he was reading, and stared hard
      at the parson; and he&mdash;not venturing to withdraw his whole attention
      from the pad (who, indeed, set up both her ears at the apparition of
      Riccabocca, and evinced symptoms of that surprise and superstitious
      repugnance at unknown objects which goes by the name of "shying")&mdash;looked
      askance at Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't stir, please," said the parson, "or I fear you'll alarm the
      creature; it seems a nervous, timid thing;&mdash;soho, gently, gently."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he fell to patting the mare with great unction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pad, thus encouraged, overcame her first natural astonishment at the
      sight of Riccabocca and the red umbrella; and having before been at the
      Casino on sundry occasions, and sagaciously preferring places within the
      range of her experience to bourns neither cognate nor conjecturable, she
      moved gravely up towards the gate on which the Italian sat; and, after
      eying him a moment,&mdash;as much as to say, "I wish you would get off,"&mdash;came
      to a deadlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Riccabocca, "since your horse seems more disposed to be
      polite to me than yourself, Mr. Dale, I take the opportunity of your
      present involuntary pause to congratulate you on your elevation in life,
      and to breathe a friendly prayer that pride may not have a fall!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut," said the parson, affecting an easy air, though still contemplating
      the pad, who appeared to have fallen into a quiet doze, "it is true that I
      have not ridden much of late years, and the squire's horses are very
      high-fed and spirited; but there is no more harm in them than their master
      when one once knows their ways."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            "'Chi va piano va sano,
             E chi va sano va lontano,'"
</pre>
    <p>
      said Riccabocca, pointing to the saddle-bags. "You go slowly, therefore
      safely; and he who goes safely may go far. You seem prepared for a
      journey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," said the parson; "and on a matter that concerns you a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me!" exclaimed Riccabocca,&mdash;"concerns me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, so far as the chance of depriving you of a servant whom you like and
      esteem affects you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Riccabocca, "I understand: you have hinted to me very often
      that I or Knowledge, or both together, have unfitted Leonard Fairfield for
      service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say that exactly; I said that you have fitted him for something
      higher than service. But do not repeat this to him. And I cannot yet say
      more to you, for I am very doubtful as to the success of my mission; and
      it will not do to unsettle poor Leonard until we are sure that we can
      improve his condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of that you can never be sure," quoth the wise man, shaking his head;
      "and I can't say that I am unselfish enough not to bear you a grudge for
      seeking to decoy away from me an invaluable servant,&mdash;faithful,
      steady, intelligent, and" (added Riccabocca, warming as he approached the
      climacteric adjective) "exceedingly cheap! Nevertheless go, and Heaven
      speed you. I am not an Alexander, to stand between man and the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a noble, great-hearted creature, Signor Riccabocca, in spite of
      your cold-blooded proverbs and villanous books." The parson, as he said
      this, brought down the whiphand with so indiscreet an enthusiasm on the
      pad's shoulder, that the poor beast, startled out of her innocent doze,
      made a bolt forward, which nearly precipitated Riccabocca from his seat on
      the stile, and then turning round&mdash;as the parson tugged desperately
      at the rein&mdash;caught the bit between her teeth, and set off at a
      canter. The parson lost both his stirrups; and when he regained them (as
      the pad slackened her pace), and had time to breathe and look about him,
      Riccabocca and the Casino were both out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," quoth Parson Dale, as he resettled himself with great
      complacency, and a conscious triumph that he was still on the pad's back,&mdash;"certainly
      it is true 'that the noblest conquest ever made by man was that of the
      horse:' a fine creature it is,&mdash;a very fine creature,&mdash;and
      uncommonly difficult to sit on, especially without stirrups." Firmly in
      his stirrups the parson planted his feet; and the heart within him was
      very proud.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The borough town of Lansmere was situated in the county adjoining that
      which contained the village of Hazeldean. Late at noon the parson crossed
      the little stream which divided the two shires, and came to an inn, which
      was placed at an angle, where the great main road branched off into two
      directions, the one leading towards Lansmere, the other going more direct
      to London. At this inn the pad stopped, and put down both ears with the
      air of a pad who has made up her mind to bait. And the parson himself,
      feeling very warm and somewhat sore, said to the pad, benignly, "It is
      just,&mdash;thou shalt have corn and water!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismounting, therefore, and finding himself very stiff as soon as he
      reached terra firma, the parson consigned the pad to the hostler, and
      walked into the sanded parlour of the inn, to repose himself on a very
      hard Windsor chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been alone rather more than half-an-hour, reading a county
      newspaper which smelled much of tobacco, and trying to keep off the flies
      that gathered round him in swarms, as if they had never before seen a
      parson, and were anxious to ascertain how the flesh of him tasted,&mdash;when
      a stagecoach stopped at the inn. A traveller got out with his carpetbag in
      his hand, and was shown into the sanded parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson rose politely, and made a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller touched his hat, without taking it off, looked at Mr. Dale
      from top to toe, then walked to the window, and whistled a lively,
      impatient tune, then strode towards the fireplace and rang the bell; then
      stared again at the parson; and that gentleman having courteously laid
      down the newspaper, the traveller seized it, threw himself into a chair,
      flung one of his legs over the table, tossed the other up on the
      mantelpiece, and began reading the paper, while he tilted the chair on its
      hind-legs with so daring a disregard to the ordinary position of chairs
      and their occupants, that the shuddering parson expected every moment to
      see him come down on the back of his skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved, therefore, to compassion, Mr. Dale said mildly,&mdash;"Those chairs
      are very treacherous, sir. I'm afraid you'll be down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh," said the traveller, looking up much astonished. "Eh, down?&mdash;oh,
      you're satirical, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Satirical, sir? upon my word, no!" exclaimed the parson, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think every freeborn man has a right to sit as he pleases in his own
      house," resumed the traveller, with warmth; "and an inn is his own house,
      I guess, so long as he pays his score. Betty, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      For the chambermaid had now replied to the bell. "I han't Betty, sir; do
      you want she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Sally; cold brandy and water&mdash;and a biscuit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I han't Sally, either," muttered the chambermaid; but the traveller,
      turning round, showed so smart a neckcloth and so comely a face, that she
      smiled, coloured, and went her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller now rose, and flung down the paper. He took out a penknife,
      and began paring his nails. Suddenly desisting from this elegant
      occupation, his eye caught sight of the parson's shovel-hat, which lay on
      a chair in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a clergyman, I reckon, sir," said the traveller, with a slight
      sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Dale bowed,&mdash;bowed in part deprecatingly, in part with
      dignity. It was a bow that said, "No offence, sir, but I am a clergyman,
      and I'm not ashamed of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going far?" asked the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Not very."
    </p>
    <p>
      TRAVELLER.&mdash;"In a chaise or fly? If so, and we are going the same
      way, halves."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Halves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      TRAVELLER.&mdash;"Yes, I'll pay half the damage, pikes inclusive."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"You are very good, sir. But" (spoken with pride) "I am on
      horseback."
    </p>
    <p>
      TRAVELLER.&mdash;"On horseback! Well, I should not have guessed that! You
      don't look like it. Where did you say you were going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say where I was going, sir," said the parson, dryly, for he was
      much offended at that vague and ungrammatical remark applicable to his
      horsemanship, that "he did not look like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close!" said the traveller, laughing; "an old traveller, I reckon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson made no reply, but he took up his shovel-hat, and, with a bow
      more majestic than the previous one, walked out to see if his pad had
      finished her corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal had indeed finished all the corn afforded to her, which was not
      much, and in a few minutes more Mr. Dale resumed his journey. He had
      performed about three miles, when the sound of wheels behind him made him
      turn his head; and he perceived a chaise driven very fast, while out of
      the windows thereof dangled strangely a pair of human legs. The pad began
      to curvet as the post-horses rattled behind, and the parson had only an
      indistinct vision of a human face supplanting those human legs. The
      traveller peered out at him as he whirled by,&mdash;saw Mr. Dale tossed up
      and down on the saddle, and cried out, "How's the leather?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leather!" soliloquized the parson, as the pad recomposed herself, "what
      does he mean by that? Leather! a very vulgar man. But I got rid of him
      cleverly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale arrived without further adventure at Lansmere. He put up at the
      principal inn, refreshed himself by a general ablution, and sat down with
      good appetite to his beefsteak and pint of port.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson was a better judge of the physiognomy of man than that of the
      horse; and after a satisfactory glance at the civil smirking landlord, who
      removed the cover and set on the wine, he ventured on an attempt at
      conversation. "Is my Lord at the Park?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LANDLORD (still more civilly than before).&mdash;"No, sir, his Lordship
      and my Lady have gone to town to meet Lord L'Estrange!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange! He is in England, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, so I heard," replied the landlord, "but we never see him here now. I
      remember him a very pretty young man. Every one was fond of him and proud
      of him. But what pranks be did play when he was a lad! We hoped he would
      come in for our boro' some of these days, but he has taken to foren parts,&mdash;more
      's the pity. I am a reg'lar Blue, sir, as I ought to be. The Blue
      candidate always does me the honour to come to the Lansmere Arms. 'T is
      only the low party puts up with the Boar," added the landlord, with a look
      of ineffable disgust. "I hope you like the wine, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, and seems old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bottled these eighteen years, sir. I had in the cask for the great
      election of Dashmore and Egerton. I have little left of it, and I never
      give it but to old friends like,&mdash;for, I think, Sir, though you be
      grown stout, and look more grand, I may say that I've had the pleasure of
      seeing you before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true, I dare say, though I fear I was never a very good customer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it is Mr. Dale, then! I thought so when you came into the hall. I
      hope your lady is quite well, and the squire too; fine pleasant-spoken
      gentleman; no fault of his if Mr. Egerton went wrong. Well, we have never
      seen him&mdash;I mean Mr. Egerton&mdash;since that time. I don't wonder he
      stays away; but my Lord's son, who was brought up here, it an't nat'ral
      like that he should turn his back on us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale made no reply, and the landlord was about to retire, when the
      parson, pouring out another glass of the port, said, "There must be great
      changes in the parish. Is Mr. Morgan, the medical man, still here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed! he took out his 'ploma after you left, and became a real
      doctor; and a pretty practice he had too, when he took, all of a sudden,
      to some new-fangled way of physicking,&mdash;I think they calls it
      homy-something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Homoeopathy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it; something against all reason: and so he lost his practice here
      and went up to Lunnun. I've not heard of him since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do the Avenels still reside in their old house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes!&mdash;and are pretty well off, I hear say. John is always
      poorly, though he still goes now and then to the Odd Fellows, and takes
      his glass; but his wife comes and fetches him away before he can do
      himself any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Avenel is the same as ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She holds her head higher, I think," said the landlord, smiling. "She was
      always&mdash;not exactly proud like, but what I calls Bumptious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard that word before," said the parson, laying down his knife
      and fork. "Bumptious indeed, though I believe it is not in the dictionary,
      has crept into familiar parlance, especially amongst young folks at school
      and college."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bumptious is bumptious, and gumptious is Bumptious," said the landlord,
      delighted to puzzle a parson. "Now the town beadle is bumptious, and Mrs.
      Avenel is Bumptious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a very respectable woman," said Mr. Dale, somewhat rebukingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In course, sir, all gumptious folks are; they value themselves on their
      respectability, and looks down on their neighbours."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (still philologically occupied).&mdash;"Gumptious&mdash;gumptious.
      I think I remember the substantive at school,&mdash;not that my master
      taught it to me. 'Gumption'&mdash;it means cleverness."
    </p>
    <p>
      LANDLORD (doggedly).&mdash;"There's gumption and Bumptious! Gumption is
      knowing; but when I say that sum 'un is gumptious, I mean&mdash;though
      that's more vulgar like&mdash;sum 'un who does not think small beer of
      hisself. You take me, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I do," said the parson, half smiling. "I believe the Avenels have
      only two of their children alive still,&mdash;their daughter who married
      Mark Fairfield, and a son who went off to America?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but he made his fortune there and has come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! I'm very glad to hear it. He has settled at Lansmere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Sir. I hear as he's bought a property a long way off. But he comes to
      see his parents pretty often&mdash;so John tells me&mdash;but I can't say
      that I ever see him. I fancy Dick does n't like to be seen by folks who
      remember him playing in the kennel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unnatural," said the parson, indulgently; "but he visits his parents;
      he is a good son at all events, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've nothing to say against him. Dick was a wild chap before he took
      himself off. I never thought he would make his fortune; but the Avenels
      are a clever set. Do you remember poor Nora&mdash;the Rose of Lansmere, as
      they called her? Ah, no, I think she went up to Lunnun afore your time,
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said the parson, dryly. "Well, I think you may take away now. It
      will be dark soon, and I'll just stroll out and look about me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a nice tart coming, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, I've dined."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson put on his hat and sallied forth into the streets. He eyed the
      houses on either hand with that melancholy and wistful interest with
      which, in middle life, men revisit scenes familiar to them in youth,&mdash;surprised
      to find either so little change or so much, and recalling, by fits and
      snatches, old associations and past emotions. The long High Street which
      he threaded now began to change its bustling character, and slide, as it
      were gradually, into the high road of a suburb. On the left, the houses
      gave way to the moss-grown pales of Lansmere Park; to the right, though
      houses still remained, they were separated from each other by gardens, and
      took the pleasing appearance of villas,&mdash;such villas as retired
      tradesmen or their widows, old maids, and half-pay officers select for the
      evening of their days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale looked at these villas with the deliberate attention of a man
      awakening his power of memory, and at last stopped before one, almost the
      last on the road, and which faced the broad patch of sward that lay before
      the lodge of Lansmere Park. An old pollard-oak stood near it, and from the
      oak there came a low discordant sound; it was the hungry cry of young
      ravens, awaiting the belated return of the parent bird! Mr. Dale put his
      hand to his brow, paused a moment, and then, with a hurried step, passed
      through the little garden, and knocked at the door. A light was burning in
      the parlour, and Mr. Dale's eye caught through the window a vague outline
      of three forms. There was an evident bustle within at the sound of the
      knock. One of the forms rose and disappeared. A very prim, neat,
      middle-aged maid-servant now appeared at the threshold, and austerely
      inquired the visitor's business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see Mr. or Mrs. Avenel. Say that I have come many miles to see
      them; and take in this card."
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid-servant took the card, and half closed the door. At least three
      minutes elapsed before she reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Missis says it's late, sir; but walk in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson accepted the not very gracious invitation, stepped across the
      little hall, and entered the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old John Avenel, a mild-looking man, who seemed slightly paralytic, rose
      slowly from his armchair. Mrs. Avenel, in an awfully stiff, clean,
      Calvinistical cap, and a gray dress, every fold of which bespoke
      respectability and staid repute, stood erect on the floor, and fixing on
      the parson a cold and cautious eye, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do the like of us great honour, Mr. Dale; take a chair. You call upon
      business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of which I apprised Mr. Avenel by letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband is very poorly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A poor creature!" said John, feebly, and as if in compassion of himself.
      "I can't get about as I used to do. But it ben't near election time, be
      it, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, John," said Mrs. Avenel, placing her husband's arm within her own.
      "You must lie down a bit, while I talk to the gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a real good Blue," said poor John; "but I ain't quite the man I was;"
      and leaning heavily on his wife, he left the room, turning round at the
      threshold, and saying, with great urbanity, "Anything to oblige, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale was much touched. He had remembered John Avenel the comeliest,
      the most active, and the most cheerful man in Lansmere; great at glee club
      and cricket (though then somewhat stricken in years), greater in vestries;
      reputed greatest in elections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last scene of all," murmured the parson; "and oh, well, turning from the
      poet, may we cry with the disbelieving philosopher, 'Poor, poor
      humanity!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Mrs. Avenel returned. She took a chair at some distance
      from the parson's, and resting one hand on the elbow of the chair, while
      with the other she stiffly smoothed the stiff gown, she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      That "Now, sir," had in its sound something sinister and warlike. This the
      shrewd parson recognized with his usual tact. He edged his chair nearer to
      Mrs. Avenel, and placing his hand on hers,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, now then, and as friend to friend."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale had been more than a quarter of an hour conversing with Mrs.
      Avenel, and had seemingly made little progress in the object of his
      diplomatic mission, for now, slowly drawing on his gloves, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I grieve to think, Mrs. Avenel, that you should have so hardened your
      heart&mdash;yes, you must pardon me,&mdash;it is my vocation to speak
      stern truths. You cannot say that I have not kept faith with you, but I
      must now invite you to remember that I specially reserved to myself the
      right of exercising a discretion to act as I judged best for the child's
      interest on any future occasion; and it was upon this understanding that
      you gave me the promise, which you would now evade, of providing for him
      when he came to manhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say I will provide for him. I say that you may 'prentice him in any
      distant town, and by and by we will stock a shop for him. What would you
      have more, sir, from folks like us, who have kept shop ourselves? It ain't
      reasonable what you ask, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friend," said the parson, "what I ask of you at present is but to
      see him, to receive him kindly, to listen to his conversation, to judge
      for yourselves. We can have but a common object,&mdash;that your grandson
      should succeed in life, and do you credit. Now, I doubt very much whether
      we can effect this by making him a small shopkeeper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And has Jane Fairfield, who married a common carpenter, brought him up to
      despise small shopkeepers?" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid! Some of the first men in England have been the sons of
      small shopkeepers. But is it a crime in them, or in their parents, if
      their talents have lifted them into such rank or renown as the haughtiest
      duke might envy? England were not England if a man must rest where his
      father began."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" said, or rather grunted, an approving voice, but neither Mrs.
      Avenel nor the parson heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All very fine," said Mrs. Avenel, bluntly. "But to send a boy like that
      to the University&mdash;where's the money to come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mrs. Avenel," said the parson, coaxingly, "the cost need not be
      great at a small college at Cambridge; and if you will pay half the
      expense, I will pay the other half. I have no children of my own, and can
      afford it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very handsome in you, sir," said Mrs. Avenel, somewhat touched,
      yet still not graciously. "But the money is not the only point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once at Cambridge," continued Mr. Dale, speaking rapidly, "at Cambridge,
      where the studies are mathematical,&mdash;that is, of a nature for which
      he has shown so great an aptitude,&mdash;and I have no doubt he will
      distinguish himself; if he does, he will obtain, on leaving, what is
      called a fellowship,&mdash;that is, a collegiate dignity accompanied by an
      income on which he could maintain himself until he made his way in life.
      Come, Mrs. Avenel, you are well off; you have no relations nearer to you
      in want of your aid. Your son, I hear, has been very fortunate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said&mdash;Mrs. Avenel, interrupting the parson, "it is not because
      my son Richard is an honour to us, and is a good son, and has made his
      fortin, that we are to rob him of what we have to leave, and give it to a
      boy whom we know nothing about, and who, in spite of what you say, can't
      bring upon us any credit at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? I don't see that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why!" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel, fiercely,&mdash;"why! you, know why. No, I
      don't want him to rise in life: I don't want folks to be speiring and
      asking about him. I think it is a very wicked thing to have put fine
      notions in his head, and I am sure my daughter Fairfield could not have
      done it herself. And now, to ask me to rob Richard, and bring out a great
      boy&mdash;who's been a gardener or ploughman, or suchlike&mdash;to
      disgrace a gentleman who keeps his carriage, as my son Richard does&mdash;I
      would have you to know, sir. No! I won't do it, and there's an end of the
      matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last two or three minutes, and just before that approving
      "good" had responded to the parson's popular sentiment, a door
      communicating with an inner room had been gently opened, and stood ajar;
      but this incident neither party had even noticed. But now the door was
      thrown boldly open, and the traveller whom the parson had met at the inn
      walked up to Mr. Dale, and said, "No! that's not the end of the matter.
      You say the boy's a 'cute, clever lad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard, have you been listening?" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I guess, yes,&mdash;the last few minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what have you heard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that this reverend gentleman thinks so highly of my sister
      Fairfield's boy that he offers to pay half of his keep at college. Sir,
      I'm very much obliged to you, and there's my hand if you'll take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson jumped up, overjoyed, and, with a triumphant glance towards
      Mrs. Avenel, shook hands heartily with Mr. Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said the latter, "just put on your hat, sir, and take a stroll with
      me, and we'll discuss the thing businesslike. Women don't understand
      business: never talk to women on business."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Mr. Richard drew out a cigar-case, selected a cigar,
      which he applied to the candle, and walked into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Avenel caught hold of the parson. "Sir, you'll be on your guard with
      Richard. Remember your promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not know all, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He? No! And you see he did not overhear more than what he says. I'm sure
      you're a gentleman, and won't go against your word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My word was conditional; but I will promise you never to break the
      silence without more reason than I think there is here for it. Indeed, Mr.
      Richard Avenel seems to save all necessity for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you coming, sir?" cried Richard, as he opened the street-door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The parson joined Mr. Richard Avenel on the road. It was a fine night, and
      the moon clear and shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then," said Mr. Richard, thoughtfully, "poor Jane, who was always the
      drudge of the family, has contrived to bring up her son well; and the boy
      is really what you say, eh,&mdash;could make a figure at college?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure of it," said the parson, hooking himself on to the arm which
      Mr. Avenel proffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see him," said Richard. "Has he any manner? Is he
      genteel, or a mere country lout?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, he speaks with so much propriety, and has so much modest dignity
      about him, that there's many a rich gentleman who would be proud of such a
      son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is odd," observed Richard, "what a difference there is in families.
      There's Jane, now, who can't read nor write, and was just fit to be a
      workman's wife, had not a thought above her station; and when I think of
      my poor sister Nora&mdash;you would not believe it, sir, but she was the
      most elegant creature in the world,&mdash;yes, even as a child (she was
      but a child when I went off to America). And often, as I was getting on in
      life, often I used to say to myself, 'My little Nora shall be a lady after
      all.' Poor thing&mdash;but she died young." Richard's voice grew husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson kindly pressed the arm on which he leaned, and said, after a
      pause,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing refines us like education, sir. I believe your sister Nora had
      received much instruction, and had the talents to profit by it: it is the
      same with your nephew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll see him," said Richard, stamping his foot firmly on the ground, "and
      if I like him, I'll be as good as a father to him. Look you, Mr.&mdash;what's
      your name, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Dale, look you, I'm a single man. Perhaps I may marry some day;
      perhaps I sha' n't. I'm not going to throw myself away. If I can get a
      lady of quality, why&mdash;but that's neither here nor there; meanwhile I
      should be glad of a nephew whom I need not be ashamed of. You see, sir, I
      am a new man, the builder of my own fortunes; and though I have picked up
      a little education&mdash;I don't well know how,&mdash;as I scramble on
      still, now I come back to the old country, I'm well aware that I 'm not
      exactly a match for those d&mdash;-d aristocrats; don't show so well in a
      drawing-room as I could wish. I could be a parliament man if I liked, but
      I might make a goose of myself; so, all things considered, if I can get a
      sort of junior partner to do the polite work, and show off the goods, I
      think the house of Avenel &amp; Co. might become a pretty considerable
      honour to the Britishers. You understand me, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well," answered Mr. Dale, smiling, though rather gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," continued the New Man, "I'm not ashamed to have risen in life by my
      own merits; and I don't disguise what I've been. And, when I'm in my own
      grand house, I'm fond of saying, 'I landed at New York with L10 in my
      purse, and here I am!' But it would not do to have the old folks with me.
      People take you with all your faults if you're rich; but they won't
      swallow your family into the bargain. So if I don't have at my house my
      own father and mother, whom I love dearly, and should like to see sitting
      at table, with my servants behind their chairs, I could still less have
      sister Jane. I recollect her very well, but she can't have got genteeler
      as she's grown older. Therefore I beg you'll not set her on coming after
      me! it would not do by any manner of means. Don't say a word about me to
      her. But send the boy down here to his grandfather, and I'll see him
      quietly, you understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but it will be hard to separate her from the boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff! all boys are separated from their parents when they go into the
      world. So that's settled. Now, just tell me. I know the old folks always
      snubbed Jane,&mdash;that is, Mother did. My poor dear father never snubbed
      any of us. Perhaps Mother has not behaved altogether well to Jane. But we
      must not blame her for that; you see this is how it happened. There were a
      good many of us, while Father and Mother kept shop in the High Street, so
      we were all to be provided for anyhow; and Jane, being very useful and
      handy at work, got a place when she was a little girl, and had no time for
      learning. Afterwards my father made a lucky hit, in getting my Lord
      Lansmere's custom after an election, in which he did a great deal for the
      Blues (for he was a famous electioneerer, my poor father). My Lady stood
      godmother to Nora; and then all my brothers, and two of my sisters, died
      off, and Father retired from business; and when he took Jane from service,
      she was so common-like that Mother could not help contrasting her with
      Nora. You see Jane was their child when they were poor little shop-people,
      with their heads scarce above water; and Nora was their child when they
      were well off, and had retired from trade, and lived genteel: so that
      makes a great difference. And Mother did not quite look on her as on her
      own child. But it was Jane's own fault: for Mother would have made it up
      with her if she had married the son of our neighbour the great
      linen-draper, as she might have done; but she would take Mark Fairfield, a
      common carpenter. Parents like best those of their children who succeed
      best in life. Natural. Why, they did not care for me till I came back the
      man I am. But to return to Jane: I'm afraid they've neglected her. How is
      she off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She earns her livelihood, and is poor, but contented."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, just be good enough to give her this" (and Richard took a bank-note
      of L50 from his pocket-book).
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can say the old folks sent it to her; or that it is a present from
      Dick, without telling her he has come back from America."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir," said the parson, "I am more and more thankful to have made
      your acquaintance. This is a very liberal gift of yours; but your best
      plan will be to send it through your mother. For, though I don't want to
      betray any confidence you place in me, I should not know what to answer if
      Mrs. Fairfield began to question me about her brother. I never had but one
      secret to keep, and I hope I shall never have another. A secret is very
      like a lie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had a secret then?" said Richard, as he took back the bank-note. He
      had learned, perhaps in America, to be a very inquisitive man. He added
      point-blank, "Pray, what was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what it would not be if I told you," said the parson, with a forced
      laugh,&mdash;"a secret!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I guess we're in a land of liberty. Do as you like. Now, I dare say
      you think me a very odd fellow to come out of my shell to you in this
      off-hand way; but I liked the look of you, even when we were at the inn
      together. And just now I was uncommonly pleased to find that, though you
      are a parson, you don't want to keep a man's nose down to a shopboard, if
      he has anything in him. You're not one of the aristocrats&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," said the parson, with imprudent warmth, "it is not the character
      of the aristocracy of this country to keep people down. They make way
      amongst themselves for any man, whatever his birth, who has the talent and
      energy to aspire to their level. That's the especial boast of the British
      constitution, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you think so, do you?" said Mr. Richard, looking sourly at the
      parson. "I dare say those are the opinions in which you have brought up
      the lad. Just keep him yourself and let the aristocracy provide for him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson's generous and patriotic warmth evaporated at once, at this
      sudden inlet of cold air into the conversation. He perceived that he had
      made a terrible blunder; and as it was not his business at that moment to
      vindicate the British constitution, but to serve Leonard Fairfield, he
      abandoned the cause of the aristocracy with the most poltroon and
      scandalous abruptness. Catching at the arm which Mr. Avenel had withdrawn
      from him, he exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir, you are mistaken; I have never attempted to influence your
      nephew's political opinions. On the contrary, if, at his age, he can be
      said to have formed any opinions, I am greatly afraid&mdash;that is, I
      think his opinions are by no means sound&mdash;that is, constitutional. I
      mean, I mean&mdash;" And the poor parson, anxious to select a word that
      would not offend his listener, stopped short in lamentable confusion of
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Avenel enjoyed his distress for a moment, with a saturnine smile, and
      then said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I calculate he's a Radical. Natural enough, if he has not got a
      sixpence to lose&mdash;all come right by and by. I'm not a Radical,&mdash;at
      least not a Destructive&mdash;much too clever a man for that, I hope. But
      I wish to see things very different from what they are. Don't fancy that I
      want the common people, who've got nothing, to pretend to dictate to their
      betters, because I hate to see a parcel of fellows who are called lords
      and squires trying to rule the roast. I think, sir, that it is men like me
      who ought to be at the top of the tree! and that's the long and the short
      of it. What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've not the least objection," said the crestfallen parson, basely. But,
      to do him justice, I must add that he did not the least know what he was
      saying!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Unconscious of the change in his fate which the diplomacy of the parson
      sought to effect, Leonard Fairfield was enjoying the first virgin
      sweetness of fame; for the principal town in his neighbourhood had
      followed the then growing fashion of the age, and set up a Mechanics'
      Institute, and some worthy persons interested in the formation of that
      provincial Athenaeum had offered a prize for the best Essay on the
      Diffusion of Knowledge,&mdash;a very trite subject, on which persons seem
      to think they can never say too much, and on which there is, nevertheless,
      a great deal yet to be said. This prize Leonard Fairfield had recently
      won. His Essay had been publicly complimented by a full meeting of the
      Institute; it had been printed at the expense of the Society, and had been
      rewarded by a silver medal,&mdash;delineative of Apollo crowning Merit
      (poor Merit had not a rag to his back; but Merit, left only to the care of
      Apollo, never is too good a customer to the tailor!) And the County
      Gazette had declared that Britain had produced another prodigy in the
      person of Dr. Riccabocca's self-educated gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attention was now directed to Leonard's mechanical contrivances. The
      squire, ever eagerly bent on improvements, had brought an engineer to
      inspect the lad's system of irrigation, and the engineer had been greatly
      struck by the simple means by which a very considerable technical
      difficulty had been overcome. The neighbouring farmers now called Leonard
      "Mr. Fairfield," and invited him on equal terms to their houses. Mr. Stirn
      had met him on the high road, touched his hat, and hoped that "he bore no
      malice." All this, I say, was the first sweetness of fame; and if Leonard
      Fairfield comes to be a great man, he will never find such sweets in the
      after fruit. It was this success which had determined the parson on the
      step which he had just taken, and which he had long before anxiously
      meditated. For, during the last year or so, he had renewed his old
      intimacy with the widow and the boy; and he had noticed, with great hope
      and great fear, the rapid growth of an intellect, which now stood out from
      the lowly circumstances that surrounded it in bold and unharmonizing
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening after his return home that the parson strolled up to
      the Casino. He put Leonard Fairfield's Prize Essay in his pocket; for he
      felt that he could not let the young man go forth into the world without a
      preparatory lecture, and he intended to scourge poor Merit with the very
      laurel wreath which it had received from Apollo. But in this he wanted
      Riccabocca's assistance; or rather he feared that, if he did not get the
      philosopher on his side, the philosopher might undo all the work of the
      parson.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A sweet sound came through the orange boughs, and floated to the ears of
      the parson, as he wound slowly up the gentle ascent,&mdash;so sweet, so
      silvery, he paused in delight&mdash;unaware, wretched man! that he was
      thereby conniving at Papistical errors. Soft it came and sweet; softer and
      sweeter,&mdash;"Ave Maria!" Violante was chanting the evening hymn to the
      Virgin Mother. The parson at last distinguished the sense of the words,
      and shook his head with the pious shake of an orthodox Protestant. He
      broke from the spell resolutely, and walked on with a sturdy step. Gaining
      the terrace, he found the little family seated under an awning,&mdash;Mrs.
      Riccabocca knitting; the signor with his arms folded on his breast: the
      book he had been reading a few moments before had fallen on the ground,
      and his dark eyes were soft and dreamy. Violante had finished her hymn,
      and seated herself on the ground between the two, pillowing her head on
      her stepmother's lap, but with her hand resting on her father's knee, and
      her gaze fixed fondly on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-evening," said Mr. Dale. Violante stole up to him, and, pulling him
      so as to bring his ear nearer to her lip, whispered, "Talk to Papa, do,&mdash;and
      cheerfully; he is sad."
    </p>
    <p>
      She escaped from him as she said this, and appeared to busy herself with
      watering the flowers arranged on stands round the awning. But she kept her
      swimming lustrous eyes wistfully on her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How fares it with you, my dear friend?" said the parson, kindly, as he
      rested his hand on the Italian's shoulder. "You must not let him get out
      of spirits, Mrs. Riccabocca."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very ungrateful to her if I ever am so," said the poor Italian, with
      all his natural gallantry. Many a good wife, who thinks it is a reproach
      to her if her husband is ever "out of spirits," might have turned
      peevishly from that speech, more elegant than sincere, and so have made
      bad worse; but Mrs. Riccabocca took her husband's proffered hand
      affectionately, and said with great naivete,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see I am so stupid, Mr. Dale; I never knew I was so stupid till I
      married. But I am very glad you are come. You can get on some learned
      subject together, and then he will not miss so much his&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His what?" asked Riccabocca, inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His country. Do you think that I cannot sometimes read your thoughts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very often. But you did not read them just then. The tongue touches where
      the tooth aches, but the best dentist cannot guess at the tooth unless one
      open one's mouth.&mdash;Basta! Can we offer you some wine of our own
      making, Mr. Dale?&mdash;it is pure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'd rather have some tea," quoth the parson, hastily. Mrs. Riccabocca,
      too pleased to be in her natural element of domestic use, hurried into the
      house to prepare our national beverage. And the parson, sliding into her
      chair, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are dejected then? Fie! If there's a virtue in the world at which
      we should always aim, it is cheerfulness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't dispute it," said Riccabocca, with a heavy sigh. "But though it
      is said by some Greek, who, I think, is quoted by your favourite Seneca,
      that a wise man carries his country with him at the soles of his feet, he
      can't carry also the sunshine over his head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you what it is," said the parson, bluntly; "you would have a much
      keener sense of happiness if you had much less esteem for philosophy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cospetto!" said the doctor, rousing himself. "Just explain, will you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does not the search after wisdom induce desires not satisfied in this
      small circle to which your life is confined? It is not so much your
      country for which you yearn, as it is for space to your intellect,
      employment for your thoughts, career for your aspirations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have guessed at the tooth which aches," said Riccabocca, with
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Easy to do that," answered the parson. "Our wisdom teeth come last and
      give us the most pain; and if you would just starve the mind a little, and
      nourish the heart more, you would be less of a philosopher and more of a&mdash;"
      The parson had the word "Christian" at the tip of his tongue; he
      suppressed a word that, so spoken, would have been exceedingly irritating,
      and substituted, with elegant antithesis, "and more of a happy man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do all I can with my heart," quoth the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not you! For a man with such a heart as yours should never feel the want
      of the sunshine. My friend, we live in an age of over mental cultivation.
      We neglect too much the simple healthful outer life, in which there is so
      much positive joy. In turning to the world within us, we grow blind to
      this beautiful world without; in studying ourselves as men, we almost
      forget to look up to heaven, and warm to the smile of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher mechanically shrugged his shoulders, as he always did when
      another man moralized,&mdash;especially if the moralizer were a priest;
      but there was no irony in his smile, as he answered thoughtfully,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is some truth in what you say. I own that we live too much as if we
      were all brain. Knowledge has its penalties and pains, as well as its
      prizes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is just what I want you to say to Leonard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have you settled the object of your journey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you as we walk down to him after tea. At present, I am rather
      too much occupied with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me? The tree is formed&mdash;try only to bend the young twig!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trees are trees, and twigs twigs," said the parson, dogmatically; "but
      man is always growing till he falls into the grave. I think I have heard
      you say that you once had a narrow escape of a prison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very narrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just suppose that you were now in that prison, and that a fairy conjured
      up the prospect of this quiet home in a safe land; that you saw the
      orange-trees in flower, felt the evening breeze on your cheek; beheld your
      child gay or sad, as you smiled or knit your brow; that within this
      phantom home was a woman, not, indeed, all your young romance might have
      dreamed of, but faithful and true, every beat of her heart all your own,&mdash;would
      you not cry from the depth of your dungeon, 'O fairy! such a change were a
      paradise!' Ungrateful man! you want interchange for your mind, and your
      heart should suffice for all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca was touched and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come hither, my child," said Mr. Dale, turning round to Violante, who
      stood still among the flowers, out of hearing, but with watchful eyes.
      "Come hither," he said, opening his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante bounded forward, and nestled to the good man's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, Violante, when you are alone in the fields or the garden, and
      have left your father looking pleased and serene, so that you have no care
      for him at your heart,&mdash;tell me, Violante, though you are all alone,
      with the flowers below, and the birds singing overhead, do you feel that
      life itself is happiness or sorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happiness!" answered Violante, half shutting her eyes, and in a measured
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you explain what kind of happiness it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, impossible! and it is never the same. Sometimes it is so still&mdash;so
      still, and sometimes so joyous, that I long for wings to fly up to God,
      and thank Him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O friend," said the parson, "this is the true sympathy between life and
      nature, and thus we should feel ever, did we take more care to preserve
      the health and innocence of a child. We are told that we must become as
      children to enter into the kingdom of Heaven; methinks we should also
      become as children to know what delight there is in our heritage of
      earth!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The maid-servant (for Jackeymo was in the fields) brought the table under
      the awning, and with the English luxury of tea, there were other drinks as
      cheap and as grateful on summer evenings,&mdash;drinks which Jackeymo had
      retained and taught from the customs of the South,&mdash;unebriate
      liquors, pressed from cooling fruits, sweetened with honey, and
      deliciously iced: ice should cost nothing in a country in which one is
      frozen up half the year! And Jackeymo, too, had added to our good, solid,
      heavy English bread preparations of wheat much lighter, and more
      propitious to digestion,&mdash;with those crisp grissins, which seem to
      enjoy being eaten, they make so pleasant a noise between one's teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson esteemed it a little treat to drink tea with the Riccaboccas.
      There was something of elegance and grace in that homely meal at the poor
      exile's table, which pleased the eye as well as taste. And the very
      utensils, plain Wedgwood though they were, had a classical simplicity,
      which made Mrs. Hazeldean's old India delf, and Mrs. Dale's best Worcester
      china, look tawdry and barbarous in comparison. For it was Flaxman who
      gave designs to Wedgwood, and the most truly refined of all our
      manufactures in porcelain (if we do not look to the mere material) is in
      the reach of the most thrifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little banquet was at first rather a silent one; but Riccabocca threw
      off his gloom, and became gay and animated. Then poor Mrs. Riccabocca
      smiled, and pressed the grissins; and Violante, forgetting all her
      stateliness, laughed and played tricks on the parson, stealing away his
      cup of warm tea when his head was turned, and substituting iced
      cherry-juice. Then the parson got up and ran after Violante, making angry
      faces, and Violante dodged beautifully, till the parson, fairly tired out,
      was too glad to cry "Peace," and come back to the cherry-juice. Thus time
      rolled on, till they heard afar the stroke of the distant church-clock,
      and Mr. Dale started up and cried, "But we shall be too late for Leonard.
      Come, naughty little girl, get your father his hat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And umbrella!" said Riccabocca, looking up at the cloudless, moonlit sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Umbrella against the stars?" asked the parson, laughing. "The stars are
      no friends of mine," said Riccabocca, "and one never knows what may
      happen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher and the parson walked on amicably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done me good," said Riccabocca, "but I hope I am not always so
      unreasonably melancholic as you seem to suspect. The evenings will
      sometimes appear long, and dull too, to a man whose thoughts on the past
      are almost his sole companions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sole companions?&mdash;your child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is so young."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is so&mdash;" the bland Italian appeared to check some disparaging
      adjective, and mildly added, "so good, I allow; but you must own that she
      and I cannot have much in common."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I own nothing of the sort. You have your house and your interests, your
      happiness and your lives, in common. We men are so exacting, we expect to
      find ideal nymphs and goddesses when we condescend to marry a mortal; and
      if we did, our chickens would be boiled to rags, and our mutton come up as
      cold as a stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Per Bacco, you are an oracle," said Riccabocca, laughing. "But I am not
      so sceptical as you are. I honour the fair sex too much. There are a great
      many women who realize the ideal of men, to be found in&mdash;the poets!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's my dear Mrs. Dale," resumed the parson, not heeding the sarcastic
      compliment to the sex, but sinking his voice into a whisper, and looking
      round cautiously,&mdash;"there's my dear Mrs. Dale, the best woman in the
      world,&mdash;an angel I would say, if the word were not profane; BUT&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the BUT?" asked the doctor, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "BUT I too might say that 'she and I have not much in common,' if I were
      only to compare mind to mind, and when my poor Carry says something less
      profound than Madame de Stael might have said, smile on her in contempt
      from the elevation of logic and Latin. Yet when I remember all the little
      sorrows and joys that we have shared together, and feel how solitary I
      should have been without her&mdash;oh, then, I am instantly aware that
      there is between us in common something infinitely closer and better than
      if the same course of study had given us the same equality of ideas; and I
      was forced to brace myself for a combat of intellect, as I am when I fall
      in with a tiresome sage like yourself. I don't pretend to say that Mrs.
      Riccabocca is a Mrs. Dale," added the parson, with lofty candour,&mdash;"there
      is but one Mrs. Dale in the world; but still, you have drawn a prize in
      the wheel matrimonial! Think of Socrates, and yet he was content even with
      his&mdash;Xantippe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Riccabocca called to mind Mrs. Dale's "little tempers," and inly
      rejoiced that no second Mrs. Dale had existed to fall to his own lot. His
      placid Jemima gained by the contrast. Nevertheless he had the ill grace to
      reply, "Socrates was a man beyond all imitation!&mdash;Yet I believe that
      even he spent very few of his evenings at home. But revenons a nos
      moutons, we are nearly at Mrs. Fairfield's cottage, and you have not yet
      told me what you have settled as to Leonard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson halted, took Riccabocca by the button, and informed him, in
      very few words, that Leonard was to go to Lansmere to see some relations
      there, who had the fortune, if they had the will, to give full career to
      his abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The great thing, in the mean while," said the parson, "would be to
      enlighten him a little as to what he calls&mdash;enlightenment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Riccabocca, diverted, and rubbing his hands, "I shall listen
      with interest to what you say on that subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And must aid me: for the first step in this modern march of enlightenment
      is to leave the poor parson behind; and if one calls out 'Hold! and look
      at the sign-post,' the traveller hurries on the faster, saying to himself,
      'Pooh, pooh!&mdash;that is only the cry of the parson!' But my gentleman,
      when he doubts me, will listen to you,&mdash;you're a philosopher!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We philosophers are of some use now and then, even to parsons!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were not so conceited a set of deluded poor creatures already, I
      would say 'Yes,'" replied the parson, generously; and, taking hold of
      Riccabocca's umbrella, he applied the brass handle thereof, by way of a
      knocker, to the cottage door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Certainly it is a glorious fever,&mdash;that desire To Know! And there are
      few sights in the moral world more sublime than that which many a garret
      might afford, if Asmodeus would bare the roofs to our survey,&mdash;namely,
      a brave, patient, earnest human being toiling his own arduous way, athwart
      the iron walls of penury, into the magnificent Infinite, which is luminous
      with starry souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there sits Leonard the Self-taught in the little cottage alone: for,
      though scarcely past the hour in which great folks dine, it is the hour in
      which small folks go to bed, and Mrs. Fairfield has retired to rest, while
      Leonard has settled to his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had placed his table under the lattice, and from time to time he looked
      up and enjoyed the stillness of the moon. Well for him that, in reparation
      for those hours stolen from night, the hardy physical labour commenced
      with dawn. Students would not be the sad dyspeptics they are, if they
      worked as many hours in the open air as my scholar-peasant. But even in
      him you could see that the mind had begun a little to affect the frame.
      They who task the intellect must pay the penalty with the body. Ill,
      believe me, would this work-day world get on if all within it were
      hard-reading, studious animals, playing the deuce with the ganglionic
      apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard started as he heard the knock at the door; the parson's well-known
      voice reassured him. In some surprise he admitted his visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are come to talk to you, Leonard," said Mr. Dale; "but I fear we shall
      disturb Mrs. Fairfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, sir! the door to the staircase is shut, and she sleeps soundly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this is a French book! Do you read French, Leonard?" asked
      Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not found French difficult, sir. Once over the grammar, and the
      language is so clear; it seems the very language for reasoning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. Voltaire said justly, 'Whatever is obscure is not French,'"
      observed Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could say the same of English," muttered the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is this,&mdash;Latin too?&mdash;Virgil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. But I find I make little way there without a master. I fear I
      must give it up" (and Leonard sighed).
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen exchanged looks, and seated themselves. The young
      peasant remained standing modestly, and in his air and mien there was
      something that touched the heart while it pleased the eye. He was no
      longer the timid boy who had shrunk from the frown of Mr. Stirn, nor that
      rude personation of simple physical strength, roused to undisciplined
      bravery, which had received its downfall on the village green of
      Hazeldean. The power of thought was on his brow,&mdash;somewhat unquiet
      still, but mild and earnest. The features had attained that refinement
      which is often attributed to race, but comes, in truth, from elegance of
      idea, whether caught from our parents or learned from books. In his rich
      brown hair, thrown carelessly from his temples, and curling almost to the
      shoulders; in his large blue eye, which was deepened to the hue of the
      violet by the long dark lash; in that firmness of lip, which comes from
      the grapple with difficulties, there was considerable beauty, but no
      longer the beauty of the mere peasant. And yet there was still about the
      whole countenance that expression of goodness and purity which a painter
      would give to his ideal of the peasant lover,&mdash;such as Tasso would
      have placed in the "Aminta," or Fletcher have admitted to the side of the
      Faithful Shepherdess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must draw a chair here, and sit down between us, Leonard," said the
      parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If any one," said Riccabocca, "has a right to sit, it is the one who is
      to hear the sermon; and if any one ought to stand, it is the one who is
      about to preach it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be frightened, Leonard," said the parson, graciously; "it is only a
      criticism, not a sermon;" and he pulled out Leonard's Prize Essay.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"You take for your motto this aphorism, 'Knowledge is
      Power.'&mdash;BACON."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Bacon make such an aphorism! The last man in the world
      to have said anything so pert and so shallow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (astonished).&mdash;"Do you mean to say, sir, that that aphorism
      is not in Lord Bacon? Why, I have seen it quoted as his in almost every
      newspaper, and in almost every speech in favour of popular education."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Then that should be a warning to you never again to
      fall into the error of the would-be scholar,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [This aphorism has been probably assigned to Lord Bacon upon the
   mere authority of the index to his works. It is the aphorism of the
   index-maker, certainly not of the great master of inductive
   philosophy. Bacon has, it is true, repeatedly dwelt on the power of
   knowledge, but with so many explanations and distinctions that
   nothing could be more unjust to his general meaning than the attempt
   to cramp into a sentence what it costs him a volume to define.
   Thus, if on one page he appears to confound knowledge with power, in
   another he sets them in the strongest antithesis to each other; as
   follows "Adeo signanter Deus opera potentix et sapientive
   discriminavit." But it would be as unfair to Bacon to convert into
   an aphorism the sentence that discriminates between knowledge and
   power as it is to convert into an aphorism any sentence that
   confounds them.]
</pre>
    <p>
      namely, quote second-hand. Lord Bacon wrote a great book to show in what
      knowledge is power, how that power should be defined, in what it might be
      mistaken. And, pray, do you think so sensible a man ever would have taken
      the trouble to write a great book upon the subject, if he could have
      packed up all he had to say into the portable dogma, 'Knowledge is power'?
      Pooh! no such aphorism is to be found in Bacon from the first page of his
      writings to the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (candidly).&mdash;"Well, I supposed it was Lord Bacon's, and I am
      very glad to hear that the aphorism has not the sanction of his
      authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (recovering his surprise).&mdash;"But why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Because it either says a great deal too much, or just&mdash;nothing
      at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"At least, sir, it seems to me undeniable."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Well, grant that it is undeniable. Does it prove much in
      favour of knowledge? Pray, is not ignorance power too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"And a power that has had much the best end of the
      quarter-staff."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"All evil is power, and does its power make it anything the
      better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Fanaticism is power,&mdash;and a power that has often
      swept away knowledge like a whirlwind. The Mussulman burns the library of
      a world, and forces the Koran and the sword from the schools of Byzantium
      to the colleges of Hindostan."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (bearing on with a new column of illustration).&mdash;"Hunger is
      power. The barbarians, starved out of their forests by their own swarming
      population, swept into Italy and annihilated letters. The Romans, however
      degraded, had more knowledge at least than the Gaul and the Visigoth."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA (bringing up the reserve).&mdash;"And even in Greece, when
      Greek met Greek, the Athenians&mdash;our masters in all knowledge&mdash;were
      beat by the Spartans, who held learning in contempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Wherefore you see, Leonard, that though knowledge be power,
      it is only one of the powers of the world; that there are others as
      strong, and often much stronger; and the assertion either means but a
      barren truism, not worth so frequent a repetition, or it means something
      that you would find it very difficult to prove."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"One nation may be beaten by another that has more physical
      strength and more military discipline; which last, permit me to say, sir,
      is a species of knowledge&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Yes; but your knowledge-mongers at present call upon us
      to discard military discipline, and the qualities that produce it, from
      the list of the useful arts. And in your own Essay, you insist upon
      knowledge as the great disbander of armies, and the foe of all military
      discipline!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Let the young man proceed. Nations, you say, may be beaten
      by other nations less learned and civilized?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"But knowledge elevates a class. I invite the members of my
      own humble order to knowledge, because knowledge will lift them into
      power."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"What do you say to that, Mr. Dale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"In the first place, is it true that the class which has the
      most knowledge gets the most power? I suppose philosophers, like my friend
      Dr. Riccabocca, think they have the most knowledge. And pray, in what age
      have philosophers governed the world? Are they not always grumbling that
      nobody attends to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Per Bacco, if people had attended to us, it would have
      been a droll sort of world by this time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Very likely. But, as a general rule, those have the most
      knowledge who give themselves up to it the most. Let us put out of the
      question philosophers (who are often but ingenious lunatics), and speak
      only of erudite scholars, men of letters and practical science,
      professors, tutors, and fellows of colleges. I fancy any member of
      parliament would tell us that there is no class of men which has less
      actual influence on public affairs. These scholars have more knowledge
      than manufacturers and shipowners, squires and farmers; but do you find
      that they have more power over the Government and the votes of the House
      of Parliament?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They ought to have," said Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ought they?" said the parson; "we'll consider that later. Meanwhile, you
      must not escape from your own proposition, which is, that knowledge is
      power,&mdash;not that it ought to be. Now, even granting your corollary,
      that the power of a class is therefore proportioned to its knowledge,
      pray, do you suppose that while your order, the operatives, are
      instructing themselves, all the rest of the community are to be at a
      standstill? Diffuse knowledge as you may, you will never produce equality
      of knowledge. Those who have most leisure, application, and aptitude for
      learning will still know the most. Nay, by a very natural law, the more
      general the appetite for knowledge, the more the increased competition
      will favour those most adapted to excel by circumstance and nature. At
      this day, there is a vast increase of knowledge spread over all society,
      compared with that in the Middle Ages; but is there not a still greater
      distinction between the highly educated gentleman and the intelligent
      mechanic, than there was then between the baron who could not sign his
      name and the churl at the plough; between the accomplished statesman,
      versed in all historical lore, and the voter whose politics are formed by
      his newspaper, than there was between the legislator who passed laws
      against witches and the burgher who defended his guild from some feudal
      aggression; between the enlightened scholar and the dunce of to-day, than
      there was between the monkish alchemist and the blockhead of yesterday?
      Peasant, voter, and dunce of this century are no doubt wiser than the
      churl, burgher, and blockhead of the twelfth. But the gentleman,
      statesman, and scholar of the present age are at least quite as favourable
      a contrast to the alchemist, witch-burner, and baron of old. As the
      progress of enlightenment has done hitherto, so will it ever do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowledge is like capital: the more there is in a country, the greater
      the disparities in wealth between one man and another. Therefore, if the
      working class increase in knowledge, so do the other classes; and if the
      working class rise peaceably and legitimately into power, it is not in
      proportion to their own knowledge alone, but rather according as it seems
      to the knowledge of the other orders of the community, that such
      augmentation of proportional power is just and safe and wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Placed between the parson and the philosopher, Leonard felt that his
      position was not favourable to the display of his forces. Insensibly he
      edged his chair somewhat away, and said mournfully,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, according to you, the reign of knowledge would be no great advance
      in the aggregate freedom and welfare of man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Let us define. By knowledge, do you mean intellectual
      cultivation; by the reign of knowledge, the ascendency of the most
      cultivated minds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (after a pause).&mdash;"Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Oh, indiscreet young man! that is an unfortunate
      concession of yours; for the ascendency of the most cultivated minds would
      be a terrible oligarchy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Perfectly true; and we now reply to your assertion that men
      who, by profession, have most learning, ought to have more influence than
      squires and merchants, farmers and mechanics. Observe, all the knowledge
      that we mortals can acquire is not knowledge positive and perfect, but
      knowledge comparative, and subject to the errors and passions of humanity.
      And suppose that you could establish, as the sole regulators of affairs,
      those who had the most mental cultivation, do you think they would not
      like that power well enough to take all means which their superior
      intelligence could devise to keep it to themselves? The experiment was
      tried of old by the priests of Egypt; and in the empire of China, at this
      day, the aristocracy are elected from those who have most distinguished
      themselves in learned colleges. If I may call myself a member of that
      body, 'the people,' I would rather be an Englishman, however much
      displeased with dull ministers and blundering parliaments, than I would be
      a Chinese under the rule of the picked sages of the Celestial Empire.
      Happily, therefore, my dear Leonard, nations are governed by many things
      besides what is commonly called knowledge; and the greatest practical
      ministers, who, like Themistocles, have made small States great, and the
      most dominant races, who, like the Romans, have stretched their rule from
      a village half over the universe, have been distinguished by various
      qualities which a philosopher would sneer at, and a knowledge-monger would
      call 'sad prejudices' and 'lamentable errors of reason.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (bitterly).&mdash;"Sir, you make use of knowledge itself to argue
      against knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"I make use of the little I know to prove the foolishness of
      idolatry. I do not argue against knowledge; I argue against
      knowledge-worship. For here, I see in your Essay, that you are not
      contented with raising human knowledge into something like divine
      omnipotence,&mdash;you must also confound her with virtue. According to
      you, it is but to diffuse the intelligence of the few among the many, and
      all at which we preachers aim is accomplished. Nay, more; for, whereas we
      humble preachers have never presumed to say, with the heathen Stoic, that
      even virtue is sure of happiness below (though it be the best road to it),
      you tell us plainly that this knowledge of yours gives not only the virtue
      of a saint, but bestows the bliss of a god. Before the steps of your idol,
      the evils of life disappear. To hear you, one has but 'to know,' in order
      to be exempt from the sins and sorrows of the ignorant. Has it ever been
      so? Grant that you diffuse amongst the many all the knowledge ever
      attained by the few. Have the wise few been so unerring and so happy? You
      supposed that your motto was accurately cited from Bacon. What was Bacon
      himself? The poet tells you
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind!'
</pre>
    <p>
      "Can you hope to bestow upon the vast mass of your order the luminous
      intelligence of this 'Lord Chancellor of Nature'? Grant that you do so,
      and what guarantee have you for the virtue and the happiness which you
      assume as the concomitants of the gift? See Bacon himself: what black
      ingratitude! what miserable self-seeking! what truckling servility! what
      abject and pitiful spirit! So far from intellectual knowledge, in its
      highest form and type, insuring virtue and bliss, it is by no means
      uncommon to find great mental cultivation combined with great moral
      corruption." (Aside to Riccabocca.&mdash;"Push on, will you?")
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCASOCCA.&mdash;"A combination remarkable in eras as in individuals.
      Petronius shows us a state of morals at which a commonplace devil would
      blush, in the midst of a society more intellectually cultivated than
      certainly was that which produced Regulus or the Horatii. And the most
      learned eras in modern Italy were precisely those which brought the vices
      into the most ghastly refinement."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (rising in great agitation, and clasping his hands).&mdash;"I
      cannot contend with you, who produce against information so slender and
      crude as mine the stores which have been locked from my reach; but I feel
      that there must be another side to this shield,&mdash;a shield that you
      will not even allow to be silver. And, oh, if you thus speak of knowledge,
      why have you encouraged me to know?"

      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Ah, my son!" said the parson, "if I wished to prove the value of
      religion, would you think I served it much if I took as my motto,
      'Religion is power'? Would not that be a base and sordid view of its
      advantages? And would you not say, He who regards religion as a power
      intends to abuse it as a priestcraft?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well put!" said Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment&mdash;let me think! Ah, I see, Sir!" said Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"If the cause be holy, do not weigh it in the scales of the
      market; if its objects be peaceful, do not seek to arm it with the weapons
      of strife; if it is to be the cement of society, do not vaunt it as the
      triumph of class against class."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (ingenuously).&mdash;"You correct me nobly, sir. Knowledge is
      power, but not in the sense in which I have interpreted the saying."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Knowledge is one of the powers in the moral world, but one
      that, in its immediate result, is not always of the most worldly advantage
      to the possessor. It is one of the slowest, because one of the most
      durable, of agencies. It may take a thousand years for a thought to come
      into power; and the thinker who originated it might have died in rags or
      in chains."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Our Italian proverb saith that 'the teacher is like the
      candle, which lights others in consuming itself.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Therefore he who has the true ambition of knowledge should
      entertain it for the power of his idea, not for the power it may bestow on
      himself: it should be lodged in the conscience, and, like the conscience,
      look for no certain reward on this side the grave. And since knowledge is
      compatible with good and with evil, would not it be better to say,
      'Knowledge is a trust'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, sir," said Leonard, cheerfully; "pray proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"You ask me why we encourage you to KNOW. First, because (as
      you say yourself in your Essay) knowledge, irrespective of gain, is in
      itself a delight, and ought to be something far more. Like liberty, like
      religion, it may be abused; but I have no more right to say that the poor
      shall be ignorant than I have to say that the rich only shall be free, and
      that the clergy alone shall learn the truths of redemption. You truly
      observe in your treatise that knowledge opens to us other excitements than
      those of the senses, and another life than that of the moment. The
      difference between us is this,&mdash;that you forget that the same
      refinement which brings us new pleasures exposes us to new pains; the
      horny hand of the peasant feels not the nettles which sting the fine skin
      of the scholar. You forget also, that whatever widens the sphere of the
      desires opens to them also new temptations. Vanity, the desire of
      applause, pride, the sense of superiority, gnawing discontent where that
      superiority is not recognized, morbid susceptibility, which comes with all
      new feelings, the underrating of simple pleasures apart from the
      intellectual, the chase of the imagination, often unduly stimulated, for
      things unattainable below,&mdash;all these are surely amongst the first
      temptations that beset the entrance into knowledge." Leonard shaded his
      face with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hence," continued the parson, benignantly,&mdash;"hence, so far from
      considering that we do all that is needful to accomplish ourselves as men,
      when we cultivate only the intellect, we should remember that we thereby
      continually increase the range of our desires, and therefore of our
      temptations; and we should endeavour, simultaneously, to cultivate both
      those affections of the heart which prove the ignorant to be God's
      children no less than the wise, and those moral qualities which have made
      men great and good when reading and writing were scarcely known: to wit,&mdash;patience
      and fortitude under poverty and distress; humility and beneficence amidst
      grandeur and wealth, and, in counteraction to that egotism which all
      superiority, mental or worldly, is apt to inspire, Justice, the father of
      all the more solid virtues, softened by Charity, which is their loving
      mother. Thus accompanied, knowledge indeed becomes the magnificent crown
      of humanity,&mdash;not the imperious despot, but the checked and tempered
      sovereign of the soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson paused, and Leonard, coming near him, timidly took his hand,
      with a child's affectionate and grateful impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCAROCCA.&mdash;"And if, Leonard, you are not satisfied with our
      parson's excellent definitions, you have only to read what Lord Bacon
      himself has said upon the true ends of knowledge to comprehend at once how
      angry the poor great man, whom Mr. Dale treats so harshly, would have been
      with those who have stinted his elaborate distinctions and provident
      cautions into that coxcombical little aphorism, and then misconstrued all
      he designed to prove in favour of the commandment, and authority of
      learning. For," added the sage, looking up as a man does when he is
      tasking his memory, "I think it is thus that after saying the greatest
      error of all is the mistaking or misplacing the end of knowledge, and
      denouncing the various objects for which it is vulgarly sought,&mdash;I
      think it is thus that Lord Bacon proceeds: 'Knowledge is not a shop for
      profit or sale, but a rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator, and
      the relief of men's estate.'"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   ["But the greatest error of all the rest is the mistaking or
   misplacing of the last or farthest end of knowledge: for men have
   entered into a desire of learning and knowledge, sometimes upon a
   natural curiosity and inquisitive appetite; sometimes to entertain
   their minds with variety and delight; sometimes for ornament and
   reputation; and sometimes to enable them to victory of wit and
   contradiction; and most times for lucre and profession"&mdash;[that is,
   for most of those objects which are meant by the ordinary titers of
   the saying, "Knowledge is power"]&mdash;"and seldom sincerely to give a
   true account of these gifts of reason to the benefit and use of men,
   as if there were sought in knowledge a couch whereupon to rest a
   searching and restless spirit; or a terrace for a wandering and
   variable mind to walk up and down, with a fair prospect; or a tower
   of state for a proud mind to raise itself upon; or a fort or
   commanding ground for strife and contention; or a shop for profit or
   sale,&mdash;and not a rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator, and
   the relief of men's estate."&mdash;Advancement of Learning, Book I.]
</pre>
    <p>
      PARSON (remorsefully).&mdash;"Are those Lord Bacon's words? I am very
      sorry I spoke so uncharitably of his life. I must examine it again. I may
      find excuses for it now that I could not when I first formed my judgment.
      I was then a raw lad at Oxford. But I see, Leonard, there is still
      something on your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"It is true, sir: I would but ask whether it is not by
      knowledge that we arrive at the qualities and virtues you so well
      describe, but which you seem to consider as coming to us through channels
      apart from knowledge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"If you mean by the word 'knowledge' something very
      different from what you express in your Essay&mdash;and which those
      contending for mental instruction, irrespective of religion and ethics,
      appear also to convey by the word&mdash;you are right; but, remember, we
      have already agreed that by the word' knowledge' we mean culture purely
      intellectual."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"That is true,&mdash;we so understood it."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Thus, when this great Lord Bacon erred, you may say that he
      erred from want of knowledge,&mdash;the knowledge which moralists and
      preachers would convey. But Lord Bacon had read all that moralists and
      preachers could say on such matters; and he certainly did not err from
      want of intellectual cultivation. Let me here, my child, invite you to
      observe, that He who knew most of our human hearts and our immortal
      destinies did not insist on this intellectual culture as essential to the
      virtues that form our well-being here, and conduce to our salvation
      hereafter. Had it been essential, the All-wise One would not have selected
      humble fishermen for the teachers of His doctrine, instead of culling His
      disciples from Roman portico or Athenian academe. And this, which
      distinguishes so remarkably the Gospel from the ethics of heathen
      philosophy, wherein knowledge is declared to be necessary to virtue, is a
      proof how slight was the heathen sage's insight into the nature of
      mankind, when compared with the Saviour's; for hard indeed would it be to
      men, whether high or low, rich or poor, if science and learning, or
      contemplative philosophy, were the sole avenues to peace and redemption;
      since, in this state of ordeal requiring active duties, very few in any
      age, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, ever are or can be devoted
      to pursuits merely mental. Christ does not represent Heaven as a college
      for the learned. Therefore the rules of the Celestial Legislator are
      rendered clear to the simplest understanding as to the deepest."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"And that which Plato and Zeno, Pythagoras and Socrates
      could not do, was done by men whose ignorance would have been a by-word in
      the schools of the Greek. The gods of the vulgar were dethroned; the face
      of the world was changed! This thought may make us allow, indeed, that
      there are agencies more powerful than mere knowledge, and ask, after all,
      what is the mission which knowledge should achieve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"The Sacred Book tells us even that; for after establishing
      the truth that, for the multitude, knowledge is not essential to happiness
      and good, it accords still to knowledge its sublime part in the revelation
      prepared and announced. When an instrument of more than ordinary
      intelligence was required for a purpose divine; when the Gospel, recorded
      by the simple, was to be explained by the acute, enforced by the
      energetic, carried home to the doubts of the Gentile, the Supreme Will
      joined to the zeal of the earlier apostles the learning and genius of
      Saint Paul,&mdash;not holier than the others, calling himself the least,
      yet labouring more abundantly than they all, making himself all things
      unto all men, so that some might be saved. The ignorant may be saved no
      less surely than the wise; but here comes the wise man who helps to save.
      And how the fulness and animation of this grand Presence, of this
      indomitable Energy, seem to vivify the toil, and to speed the work! 'In
      journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of
      mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in
      perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils amongst false
      brethren.' Behold, my son! does not Heaven here seem to reveal the true
      type of Knowledge,&mdash;a sleepless activity, a pervading agency, a
      dauntless heroism, an all-supporting faith?&mdash;a power, a power indeed;
      a power apart from the aggrandizement of self; a power that brings to him
      who owns and transmits it but 'weariness and painfulness; in watchings
      often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness,'&mdash;but
      a power distinct from the mere circumstance of the man, rushing from him
      as rays from the sun; borne through the air, and clothing it with light,
      piercing under earth, and calling forth the harvest. Worship not
      knowledge, worship not the sun, O my child! Let the sun but proclaim the
      Creator; let the knowledge but illumine the worship!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man, overcome by his own earnestness, paused; his head drooped on
      the young student's breast, and all three were long silent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whatever ridicule may be thrown upon Mr. Dale's dissertations by the wit
      of the enlightened, they had a considerable, and I think a beneficial,
      effect upon Leonard Fairfield,&mdash;an effect which may perhaps create
      less surprise, when the reader remembers that Leonard was unaccustomed to
      argument, and still retained many of the prejudices natural to his rustic
      breeding. Nay, he actually thought it possible that, as both Riccabocca
      and Mr. Dale were more than double his age, and had had opportunities not
      only of reading twice as many books, but of gathering up experience in
      wider ranges of life,&mdash;he actually, I say, thought it possible that
      they might be better acquainted with the properties and distinctions of
      knowledge than himself. At all events, the parson's words were so far
      well-timed, that they produced in Leonard very much of that state of mind
      which Mr. Dale desired to effect, before communicating to him the
      startling intelligence that he was to visit relations whom he had never
      seen, of whom he had heard but little, and that it was at least possible
      that the result of that visit might be to open to him greater facilities
      for instruction, and a higher degree in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without some such preparation, I fear that Leonard would have gone forth
      into the world with an exaggerated notion of his own acquirements, and
      with a notion yet more exaggerated as to the kind of power that such
      knowledge as he possessed would obtain for itself. As it was, when Mr.
      Dale broke to him the news of the experimental journey before him,
      cautioning him against being over sanguine, Leonard received the
      intelligence with a serious meekness, and thoughts that were nobly solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed on his visitors, he remained for some moments
      motionless, and in deep meditation; then he unclosed the door and stole
      forth. The night was already far advanced, the heavens were luminous with
      all the host of stars. "I think," said the student, referring, in later
      life, to that crisis in his destiny,&mdash;"I think it was then, as I
      stood alone, yet surrounded by worlds so numberless, that I first felt the
      distinction between mind and soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," said Riccabocca, as he parted company with Mr. Dale, "whether
      you would have given to Frank Hazeldean, on entering life, the same
      lecture on the limits and ends of knowledge which you have bestowed on
      Leonard Fairfield?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend," quoth the parson, with a touch of human conceit, "I have
      ridden on horseback, and I know that some horses should be guided by the
      bridle, and some should be urged by the spur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cospetto!" said Riccabocca, "you contrive to put every experience of
      yours to some use,&mdash;even your journey on Mr. Hazeldean's pad. And I
      now see why, in this little world of a village, you have picked up so
      general an acquaintance with life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever read White's' Natural History of Selborne'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, and you will find that you need not go far to learn the habits of
      birds, and know the difference between a swallow and a swift. Learn the
      difference in a village, and you know the difference wherever swallows and
      swifts skim the air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swallows and swifts!&mdash;true; but men&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are with us all the year round,&mdash;which is more than we can say of
      swallows and swifts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Dale," said Riccabocca, taking off his hat with great formality, "if
      ever again I find myself in a dilemma, I will come to you instead of to
      Machiavelli."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" cried the parson, "if I could but have a calm hour's talk with you
      on the errors of the Papal relig&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca was off like a shot.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day Mr. Dale had a long conversation with Mrs. Fairfield. At
      first he found some difficulty in getting over her pride, and inducing her
      to accept overtures from parents who had so long slighted both Leonard and
      herself. And it would have been in vain to have put before the good woman
      the worldly advantages which such overtures implied. But when Mr. Dale
      said, almost sternly, "Your parents are old, your father infirm; their
      least wish should be as binding to you as their command," the widow bowed
      her head, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless them, sir, I was very sinful 'Honour your father and mother.'
      I'm no schollard, but I know the Commandments. Let Lenny go. But he'll
      soon forget me, and mayhap he'll learn to be ashamed of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There I will trust him," said the parson; and he contrived easily to
      reassure and soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till all this was settled that Mr. Dale drew forth an unsealed
      letter, which Mr. Richard Avenel, taking his hint, had given to him, as
      from Leonard's grandparents, and said, "This is for you, and it contains
      an inclosure of some value."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you read it, sir? As I said before, I'm no schollard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Leonard is, and he will read it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Leonard returned home that evening, Mrs. Fairfield showed him the
      letter. It ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   DEAR JANE,&mdash;Mr. Dale will tell you that we wish Leonard to come to
   us. We are glad to hear you are well. We forward, by Mr. Dale, a
   bank-note for L50, which comes from Richard, your brother. So no
   more at present from your affectionate parents,

   JOHN AND MARGARET AVENEL.
</pre>
    <p>
      The letter was in a stiff female scrawl, and Leonard observed that two or
      three mistakes in spelling had been corrected, either in another pen or in
      a different hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear brother Dick, how good in him!" cried the widow. "When I saw there
      was money, I thought it must be him. How I should like to see Dick again!
      But I s'pose he's still in Amerikay. Well, well, this will buy clothes for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; you must keep it all, Mother, and put it in the Savings Bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm not quite so silly as that," cried Mrs. Fairfield, with contempt;
      and she put the L50 into a cracked teapot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must not stay there when I 'm gone. You may be robbed, Mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, dear me, that's true. What shall I do with it? What do I want
      with it, too? Dear me! I wish they hadn't sent it. I sha' n't sleep in
      peace. You must e'en put it in your own pouch, and button it up tight,
      boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lenny smiled, and took the note; but he took it to Mr. Dale, and begged
      him to put it into the Savings Bank for his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day following he went to take leave of his master, of Jackeymo, of the
      fountain, the garden. But after he had gone through the first of these
      adieus with Jackeymo&mdash;who, poor man, indulged in all the lively
      gesticulations of grief which make half the eloquence of his countrymen,
      and then, absolutely blubbering, hurried away&mdash;Leonard himself was so
      affected that he could not proceed at once to the house, but stood beside
      the fountain, trying hard to keep back his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, Leonard&mdash;and you are going!" said a soft voice; and the tears
      fell faster than ever, for he recognized the voice of Violante.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not cry," continued the child, with a kind of tender gravity. "You are
      going, but Papa says it would be selfish in us to grieve, for it is for
      your good; and we should be glad. But I am selfish, Leonard, and I do
      grieve. I shall miss you sadly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, young lady,&mdash;you miss me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but I do not cry, Leonard, for I envy you, and I wish I were a boy:
      I wish I could do as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl clasped her hands, and reared her slight form, with a kind of
      passionate dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do as me, and part from all those you love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But to serve those you love. One day you will come back to your mother's
      cottage, and say, 'I have conquered fortune.' Oh that I could go forth and
      return, as you will! But my father has no country, and his only child is a
      useless girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Violante spoke, Leonard had dried his tears: her emotion distracted him
      from his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," continued Violante, again raising her head loftily, "what it is to
      be a man! A woman sighs, 'I wish,' but a man should say, 'I will.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally before Leonard had noted fitful flashes of a nature grand and
      heroic in the Italian child, especially of late,&mdash;flashes the more
      remarkable from the contrast to a form most exquisitely feminine, and to a
      sweetness of temper which made even her pride gentle. But now it seemed as
      if the child spoke with the command of a queen,&mdash;almost with the
      inspiration of a Muse. A strange and new sense of courage entered within
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I remember these words!" he murmured, half audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned and surveyed him with eyes brighter for their moisture.
      She then extended her hand to him, with a quick movement, and as he bent
      over it, with a grace taught to him by genuine emotion, she said, "And if
      you do, then, girl and child as I am, I shall think I have aided a brave
      heart in the great strife for honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She lingered a moment, smiled as if to herself, and then, gliding away,
      was lost amongst the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long pause, in which Leonard recovered slowly from the surprise
      and agitation into which Violante had thrown his spirits&mdash;previously
      excited as they were&mdash;he went, murmuring to himself, towards the
      house. But Riccabocca was from home. Leonard turned mechanically to the
      terrace, and busied himself with the flowers; but the dark eyes of
      Violante shone on his thoughts, and her voice rang in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Riccabocca appeared on the road, attended by a labourer, who
      carried something indistinct under his arm. The Italian beckoned to
      Leonard to follow him into the parlour, and after conversing with him
      kindly, and at some length, and packing up, as it were, a considerable
      provision of wisdom in the portable shape of aphorisms and proverbs, the
      sage left him alone for a few moments. Riccabocca then returned with his
      wife, and bearing a small knapsack:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not much we can do for you, Leonard, and money is the worst gift in
      the world for a keepsake; but my wife and I have put our heads together to
      furnish you with a little outfit. Giacomo, who was in our secret, assures
      us that the clothes will fit; and stole, I fancy, a coat of yours, to have
      the right measure. Put them on when you go to your relations: it is
      astonishing what a difference it makes in the ideas people form of us,
      according as our coats are cut one way or another. I should not be
      presentable in London thus; and nothing is more true than that a tailor is
      often the making of a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The shirts, too, are very good holland," said Mrs. Riccabocca, about to
      open the knapsack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind details, my dear," cried the wise man; "shirts are
      comprehended in the general principle of clothes. And, Leonard, as a
      remembrance somewhat more personal, accept this, which I have worn many a
      year when time was a thing of importance to me, and nobler fates than mine
      hung on a moment. We missed the moment, or abused it; and here I am a waif
      on a foreign shore. Methinks I have done with Time."
    </p>
    <p>
      The exile, as he thus spoke, placed in Leonard's reluctant hands a watch
      that would have delighted an antiquary, and shocked a dandy. It was
      exceedingly thick, having an outer case of enamel and an inner one of
      gold. The hands and the figures of the hours had originally been formed of
      brilliants; but the brilliants had long since vanished. Still, even thus
      bereft, the watch was much more in character with the giver than the
      receiver, and was as little suited to Leonard as would have been the red
      silk umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is old-fashioned," said Mrs. Riccabocca; "but it goes better than any
      clock in the county. I really think it will last to the end of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carissima mia!" cried the doctor, "I thought I had convinced you that the
      world is by no means come to its last legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I did not mean anything, Alphonso," said Mrs. Riccabocca, colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is all we do mean when we talk about that of which we can know
      nothing," said the doctor, less gallantly than usual, for he resented that
      epithet of "old-fashioned," as applied to the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, we see, had been silent all this time; he could not speak,&mdash;literally
      and truly, he could not speak. How he got out of his embarrassment and how
      he got out of the room, he never explained to my satisfaction. But a few
      minutes afterwards, he was seen hurrying down the road very briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca and his wife stood at the window gazing after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a depth in that boy's heart," said the sage, "which might float
      an argosy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor dear boy! I think we have put everything into the knapsack that he
      can possibly want," said good Mrs. Riccabocca, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR (continuing his soliloquy).&mdash;"They are strong, but they
      are not immediately apparent."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. RICCABOCCA (resuming hers).&mdash;"They are at the bottom of the
      knapsack."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR.&mdash;"They will stand long wear and tear."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"A year, at least, with proper care at the wash."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR (startled).&mdash;"Care at the wash! What on earth are you
      talking of, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. RICCABOCCA (mildly).&mdash;"The shirts, to be sure, my love! And
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR (with a heavy sigh).&mdash;"The feelings, ma'am!" Then, after a
      pause, taking his wife's hand affectionately, "But you did quite right to
      think of the shirts: Mr. Dale said very truly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR.&mdash;"That there was a great deal in common between us&mdash;even
      when I think of feelings, and you but of&mdash;shirts!"

      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Avenel sat within the parlour, Mr. Richard stood on the
      hearthrug, whistling "Yankee Doodle." "The parson writes word that the lad
      will come to-day," said Richard, suddenly; "let me see the letter,&mdash;ay,
      to-day. If he took the coach as far as &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-, he might
      walk the rest of the way in two or three hours. He should be pretty nearly
      here. I have a great mind to go and meet him: it will save his asking
      questions, and hearing about me. I can clear the town by the back way, and
      get out at the high road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll not know him from any one else," said Mrs. Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that is a good one! Not know an Avenel! We've all the same cut of
      the jib,&mdash;have we not, Father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor John laughed heartily, till the tears rolled down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were always a well-favoured fam'ly," said John, recomposing himself.
      "There was Luke, but he's gone; and Harry, but he's dead too; and Dick,
      but he's in Amerikay&mdash;no, he's here; and my darling Nora, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" interrupted Mrs. Avenel; "hush, John!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared at her, and then put his tremulous hand to his brow.
      "And Nora's gone too!" said he, in a voice of profound woe. Both hands
      then fell on his knees, and his head drooped on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Avenel rose, kissed her husband on the forehead, and walked away to
      the window. Richard took up his hat and brushed the nap carefully with his
      handkerchief; but his lips quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm going," said he, abruptly. "Now mind, Mother, not a word about uncle
      Richard yet; we must first see how we like each other, and&mdash;[in a
      whisper] you'll try and get that into my poor father's head?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Richard," said Mrs. Avenel, quietly. Richard put on his hat and went
      out by the back way. He stole along the fields that skirted the town, and
      had only once to cross the street before he got into the high road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on till he came to the first milestone. There he seated himself,
      lighted his cigar, and awaited his nephew. It was now nearly the hour of
      sunset, and the road before him lay westward. Richard, from time to time,
      looked along the road, shading his eyes with his hand; and at length, just
      as the disk of the sun had half sunk down the horizon, a solitary figure
      came up the way. It emerged suddenly from the turn in the road; the
      reddening beams coloured all the atmosphere around it. Solitary and silent
      it came as from a Land of Light.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "You have been walking far, young man?" said Richard Avenel.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "No, sir, not very. That is Lansmere before me, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is Lansmere; you stop there, I guess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard made a sign in the affirmative, and walked on a few paces; then,
      seeing the stranger who had accosted him still by his side, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you know the town, sir, perhaps you will have the goodness to tell me
      whereabouts Mr. Avenel lives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can put you into a straight cut across the fields, that will bring you
      just behind the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind, but it will take you out of your way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is in my way. So you are going to Mr. Avenel's?&mdash;a good old
      gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've always heard so; and Mrs. Avenel&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A particular superior woman," said Richard. "Any one else to ask after?&mdash;I
      know the family well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have a son, I believe; but he's in America, is he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe he is, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see the parson has kept faith with me muttered Richard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can tell me anything about HIM," said Leonard, "I should be very
      glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so, young man? Perhaps he is hanged by this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hanged!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was a sad dog, I am told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have been told very falsely," said Leonard, colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sad wild dog; his parents were so glad when he cut and run,&mdash;went
      off to the States. They say he made money; but, if so, he neglected his
      relations shamefully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Leonard, "you are wholly misinformed. He has been most
      generous to a relation who had little claim on him: and I never heard his
      name mentioned but with love and praise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard instantly fell to whistling "Yankee Doodle," and walked on several
      paces without saying a word. He then made a slight apology for his
      impertinence, hoped no offence, and, with his usual bold but astute style
      of talk, contrived to bring out something of his companion's mind. He was
      evidently struck with the clearness and propriety with which Leonard
      expressed himself, raised his eyebrows in surprise more than once, and
      looked him full in the face with an attentive and pleased survey. Leonard
      had put on the new clothes with which Riccabocca and his wife had provided
      him. They were those appropriate to a young country tradesman in good
      circumstances; but as Leonard did not think about the clothes, so he had
      unconsciously something of the ease of the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now came into the fields. Leonard paused before a slip of ground sown
      with rye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have thought grass-land would have answered better so near a
      town," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt it would," answered Richard; "but they are sadly behind-hand in
      these parts. You see the great park yonder, on the other side of the road?
      That would answer better for rye than grass; but then, what would become
      of my Lord's deer? The aristocracy eat us up, young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the aristocracy did not sow this piece with rye, I suppose?" said
      Leonard, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you conclude from that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let every man look to his own ground," said Leonard, with a cleverness of
      repartee caught from Dr. Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cute lad you are," said Richard; "and we'll talk more of these matters
      another time."
    </p>
    <p>
      They now came within sight of Mr. Avenel's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can get through the gap in the hedge, by the old pollard-oak," said
      Richard; "and come round by the front of the house. Why, you're not
      afraid, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I introduce you? I told you that I knew the old couple."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, sir! I would rather meet them alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go; and&mdash;wait a bit-hark ye, young man, Mrs. Avenel is a
      cold-mannered woman; but don't be abashed by that." Leonard thanked the
      good-natured stranger, crossed the field, passed the gap, and paused a
      moment under the stinted shade of the old hollow-hearted oak. The ravens
      were returning to their nests. At the sight of a human form under the tree
      they wheeled round and watched him afar. From the thick of the boughs, the
      young ravens sent their hoarse low cry.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young man entered the neat, prim, formal parlour. "You are welcome!"
      said Mrs. Avenel, in a firm voice. "The gentleman is heartily welcome,"
      cried poor John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is your grandson, Leonard Fairfield," said Mrs. Avenel. But John, who
      had risen with knocking knees, gazed hard at Leonard, and then fell on his
      breast, sobbing aloud, "Nora's eyes!&mdash;he has a blink in his eye like
      Nora's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Avenel approached with a steady step, and drew away the old man
      tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a poor creature," she whispered to Leonard; "you excite him. Come
      away, I will show you your room." Leonard followed her up the stairs, and
      came into a room neatly and even prettily furnished. The carpet and
      curtains were faded by the sun, and of old-fashioned pattern; there was a
      look about the room as if it had been long disused. Mrs. Avenel sank down
      on the first chair on entering. Leonard drew his arm round her waist
      affectionately: "I fear that I have put you out sadly, my dear
      grandmother." Mrs. Avenel glided hastily from his arm, and her countenance
      worked much, every nerve in it twitching, as it were; then, placing her
      hand on his locks, she said with passion, "God bless you, my grandson,"
      and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard dropped his knapsack on the floor, and looked around him
      wistfully. The room seemed as if it had once been occupied by a female.
      There was a work-box on the chest of drawers, and over it hanging shelves
      for books, suspended by ribbons that had once been blue, with silk and
      fringe appended to each shelf, and knots and tassels here and there,&mdash;the
      taste of a woman, or rather of a girl, who seeks to give a grace to the
      commonest things around her. With the mechanical habit of a student,
      Leonard took down one or two of the volumes still left on the shelves. He
      found Spenser's "Faerie Queene," Racine in French, Tasso in Italian; and
      on the fly-leaf of each volume, in the exquisite handwriting familiar to
      his memory, the name "Leonora." He kissed the books, and replaced them
      with a feeling akin both to tenderness and awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been alone in his room more than a quarter of an hour before
      the maid-servant knocked at his door and summoned him to tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor John had recovered his spirits, and his wife sat by his side, holding
      his hand in hers. Poor John was even gay. He asked many questions about
      his daughter Jane, and did not wait for the answers. Then he spoke about
      the squire, whom he confounded with Audley Egerton, and talked of
      elections and the Blue party, and hoped Leonard would always be a good
      Blue; and then he fell to his tea and toast, and said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Avenel spoke little, but she eyed Leonard askant, as it were, from
      time to time; and, after each glance, the nerves of the poor severe face
      twitched again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after nine o'clock, Mrs. Avenel lighted a candle, and placing it
      in Leonard's hand, said, "You must be tired,&mdash;you know your own room
      now. Good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard took the light, and, as was his wont with his mother, kissed Mrs.
      Avenel on the cheek. Then he took John's hand and kissed him too. The old
      man was half asleep, and murmured dreamily, "That's Nora."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard had retired to his room about half an hour, when Richard Avenel
      entered the house softly, and joined his parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mother?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Richard, you have seen him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And like him. Do you know he has a great look of poor Nora?&mdash;more
      like her than Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he is handsomer than Jane ever was, but more like your father than
      any one. John was so comely. You take to the boy, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, that I do. Just tell him in the morning that he is to go with a
      gentleman who will be his friend, and don't say more. The chaise shall be
      at the door after breakfast. Let him get into it: I shall wait for him out
      of the town. What's the room you gave him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The room you would not take."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The room in which Nora slept? Oh, no! I could not have slept a wink
      there. What a charm there was in that girl! how we all loved her! But she
      was too beautiful and good for us,&mdash;too good to live!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None of us are too good," said Mrs. Avenel, with great austerity, "and I
      beg you will not talk in that way. Goodnight,&mdash;I must get your poor
      father to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Leonard opened his eyes the next morning, they rested on the face of
      Mrs. Avenel, which was bending over his pillow. But it was long before he
      could recognize that countenance, so changed was its expression,&mdash;so
      tender, so mother-like. Nay, the face of his own mother had never seemed
      to him so soft with a mother's passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he murmured, half rising, and flinging his young arms round her
      neck. Mrs. Avenel, this time taken by surprise, warmly returned the
      embrace; she clasped him to her breast, she kissed him again and again. At
      length, with a quick start, she escaped, and walked up and down the room,
      pressing her hands tightly together. When she halted, her face had
      recovered its usual severity and cold precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is time for you to rise, Leonard," said she. "You will leave us
      to-day. A gentleman has promised to take charge of you, and do for you
      more than we can. A chaise will be at the door soon,&mdash;make haste."
    </p>
    <p>
      John was absent from the breakfast-table. His wife said that he never rose
      till late, and must not be disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal was scarcely over before a chaise and pair came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not keep the chaise waiting,&mdash;the gentleman is very
      punctual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is not come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he has walked on before, and will get in after you are out of the
      town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is his name, and why should he care for me, Grandmother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will tell you himself. Be quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will bless me again, Grandmother? I love you already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do bless you," said Mrs. Avenel, firmly. "Be honest and good, and
      beware of the first false step." She pressed his hand with a convulsive
      grasp, and led him to the outer door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postboy clanked his whip, the chaise rattled off. Leonard put his head
      out of the window to catch a last glimpse of the old woman; but the boughs
      of the pollard-oak, and its gnarled decaying trunk, hid her from his eye,
      and look as he would, till the road turned, he saw but the melancholy
      tree.

      "I hope, Pisistratus," said my father, "that you do not intend to be
      dull?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid, sir! What could make you ask such a question? Intend! No!
      if I am dull it is from innocence."

      "A very long discourse upon knowledge!" said my father; "very long! I

      I looked upon my father as a Byzantian sage might have looked on a Vandal.
      "Cut it out!"

      "Stops the action, sir!" said my father, dogmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Action! But a novel is not a drama."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; it is a great deal longer,&mdash;twenty times as long, I dare say,"
      replied Mr. Caxton, with a sigh.

    <p>
      "Well, sir, well! I think my Discourse upon Knowledge has much to do with
      the subject, is vitally essential to the subject; does not stop the

      astonished, sir, that you, a scholar, and a cultivator of knowledge&mdash;"

      "There, there!" cried my father, deprecatingly. "I yield, I yield! What
      better could I expect when I set up for a critic? What author ever lived
      that did not fly into a passion, even with his own father, if his father
      presumed to say, 'Cut out'!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "HALT, cried a voice; and not a little surprised was Leonard when the
      stranger who had accosted him the preceding evening got into the chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Richard, "I am not the sort of man you expected, eh? Take
      time to recover yourself." And with these words Richard drew forth a book
      from his pocket, threw himself back, and began to read. Leonard stole many
      a glance at the acute, hardy, handsome face of his companion, and
      gradually recognized a family likeness to poor John, in whom, despite age
      and infirmity, the traces of no common share of physical beauty were still
      evident. And, with that quick link in ideas which mathematical aptitude
      bestows, the young student at once conjectured that he saw before him his
      uncle Richard. He had the discretion, however, to leave that gentleman
      free to choose his own time for introducing himself, and silently revolved
      the new thoughts produced by the novelty of his situation. Mr. Richard
      read with notable quickness,&mdash;sometimes cutting the leaves of the
      book with his penknife, sometimes tearing them open with his forefinger,
      sometimes skipping whole pages altogether. Thus he galloped to the end of
      the volume, flung it aside, lighted his cigar, and began to talk. He put
      many questions to Leonard relative to his rearing, and especially to the
      mode by which he had acquired his education; and Leonard, confirmed in the
      idea that he was replying to a kinsman, answered frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard did not think it strange that Leonard should have acquired so much
      instruction with so little direct tuition. Richard Avenel himself had been
      tutor to himself. He had lived too long with our go-ahead brethren who
      stride the world on the other side the Atlantic with the seven-leagued
      boots of the Giant-killer, not to have caught their glorious fever for
      reading. But it was for a reading wholly different from that which was
      familiar to Leonard. The books he read must be new; to read old books
      would have seemed to him going back in the world. He fancied that new
      books necessarily contained new ideas,&mdash;a common mistake,&mdash;and
      our lucky adventurer was the man of his day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired with talking, he at length chucked the book he had run through to
      Leonard, and taking out a pocket-book and pencil, amused himself with
      calculations on some detail of his business, after which he fell into an
      absorbed train of thought, part pecuniary, part ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard found the book interesting: it was one of the numerous works,
      half-statistic, half-declamatory, relating to the condition of the working
      classes, which peculiarly distinguish our century, and ought to bind
      together rich and poor, by proving the grave attention which modern
      society bestows upon all that can affect the welfare of the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dull stuff! theory! claptrap!" said Richard, rousing himself from his
      revery at last; "it can't interest you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All books interest me, I think," said Leonard, "and this especially; for
      it relates to the working class, and I am one of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were yesterday, but you mayn't be to-morrow," answered Richard,
      good-humouredly, and patting him on the shoulder. "You see, my lad, that
      it is the middle class which ought to govern the country. What the book
      says about the ignorance of country magistrates is very good; but the man
      writes pretty considerable trash when he wants to regulate the number of
      hours a free-born boy should work at a factory,&mdash;only ten hours a day&mdash;pooh!
      and so lose two hours to the nation! Labour is wealth; and if we could get
      men to work twenty-four hours a day, we should be just twice as rich. If
      the march of civilization is to proceed," continued Richard, loftily,
      "men, and boys too, must not lie a bed doing nothing, all night, sir."
      Then, with a complacent tone, "We shall get to the twenty-four hours at
      last; and, by gad, we must, or we sha'n't flog the Europeans as we do
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the inn at which Richard had first made acquaintance with
      Mr. Dale, the coach by which he had intended to perform the rest of the
      journey was found to be full. Richard continued to perform the journey in
      postchaises, not without some grumbling at the expense, and incessant
      orders to the post-boys to make the best of the way. "Slow country this in
      spite of all its brag," said he,&mdash;"very slow. Time is money&mdash;they
      know that in the States; for why? they are all men of business there.
      Always slow in a country where a parcel of lazy, idle lords and dukes and
      baronets seem to think 'time is pleasure.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening the chaise approached the confines of a very large town,
      and Richard began to grow fidgety. His easy, cavalier air was abandoned.
      He withdrew his legs from the window, out of which they had been
      luxuriously dangling, pulled down his waistcoat, buckled more tightly his
      stock; it was clear that he was resuming the decorous dignity that belongs
      to state. He was like a monarch who, after travelling happy and incognito,
      returns to his capital. Leonard divined at once that they were nearing
      their journey's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humble foot-passengers now looked at the chaise, and touched their hats.
      Richard returned the salutation with a nod,&mdash;a nod less gracious than
      condescending. The chaise turned rapidly to the left, and stopped before a
      small lodge, very new, very white, adorned with two Doric columns in
      stucco, and flanked by a large pair of gates. "Hollo!" cried the post-boy,
      and cracked his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two children were playing before the lodge, and some clothes were hanging
      out to dry on the shrubs and pales round the neat little building.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang those brats! they are actually playing," growled Dick. "As I live,
      the jade has been washing again! Stop, boy!" During this soliloquy, a
      good-looking young woman had rushed from the door, slapped the children
      as, catching sight of the chaise, they ran towards the house, opened the
      gates, and dropping a courtesy to the ground, seemed to wish that she
      could drop into it altogether; so frightened and so trembling seemed she
      to shrink from the wrathful face which the master now put out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I tell you, or did I not," said Dick, "that I would not have those
      horrid, disreputable cubs of yours playing just before my lodge gates?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't answer me. And did I tell you, or did I not, that the next time I
      saw you making a drying-ground of my lilacs, you should go out, neck and
      crop&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, please, sir&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You leave my lodge next Saturday! drive on, boy. The ingratitude and
      insolence of those common people are disgraceful to human nature,"
      muttered Richard, with an accent of the bitterest misanthropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaise wheeled along the smoothest and freshest of gravel roads, and
      through fields of the finest land, in the highest state of cultivation.
      Rapid as was Leonard's survey, his rural eye detected the signs of a
      master in the art agronomial. Hitherto he had considered the squire's
      model farm as the nearest approach to good husbandry he had seen; for
      Jackeymo's finer skill was developed rather on the minute scale of
      market-gardening than what can fairly be called husbandry. But the
      squire's farm was degraded by many old-fashioned notions, and concessions
      to the whim of the eye, which would not be found in model farms nowadays,&mdash;large
      tangled hedgerows, which, though they constitute one of the beauties most
      picturesque in old England, make sad deductions from produce; great trees,
      overshadowing the corn and harbouring the birds; little patches of rough
      sward left to waste; and angles of woodland running into fields, exposing
      them to rabbits and blocking out the sun. These and such like blots on a
      gentleman-farmer's agriculture, common-sense and Giacomo had made clear to
      the acute comprehension of Leonard. No such faults were perceptible in
      Richard Avenel's domain. The fields lay in broad divisions, the hedges
      were clipped and narrowed into their proper destination of mere
      boundaries. Not a blade of wheat withered under the cold shade of a tree;
      not a yard of land lay waste; not a weed was to be seen, not a thistle to
      waft its baleful seed through the air: some young plantations were placed,
      not where the artist would put them, but just where the farmer wanted a
      fence from the wind. Was there no beauty in this? Yes, there was beauty of
      its kind,&mdash;beauty at once recognizable to the initiated, beauty of
      use and profit, beauty that could bear a monstrous high rent. And Leonard
      uttered a cry of admiration which thrilled through the heart of Richard
      Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This IS farming!" said the villager.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I guess it is," answered Richard, all his ill-humour vanishing.
      "You should have seen the land when I bought it. But we new men, as they
      call us (damn their impertinence!) are the new blood of this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Avenel never said anything more true. Long may the new blood
      circulate through the veins of the mighty giantess; but let the grand
      heart be the same as it has beat for proud ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chaise now passed through a pretty shrubbery, and the house came into
      gradual view,&mdash;a house with a portico, all the offices carefully
      thrust out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postboy dismounted and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I almost think they are going to keep me waiting," said Mr. Richard,
      well-nigh in the very words of Louis XIV. But the fear was not realized,&mdash;the
      door opened; a well-fed servant out of livery presented himself. There was
      no hearty welcoming smile on his face, but he opened the chaise-door with
      demure and taciturn respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's George? Why does he not come to the door?" asked Richard;
      descending from the chaise slowly, and leaning on the servant's
      outstretched arm with as much precaution as if he had had the gout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, George here came into sight, settling himself hastily into
      his livery coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See to the things, both of you," said Richard, as he paid the postboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard stood on the gravel sweep, gazing at the square white house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Handsome elevation&mdash;classical, I take it, eh?" said Richard, joining
      him. "But you should see the offices." He then, with familiar kindness,
      took Leonard by the arm, and drew him within. He showed him the hall, with
      a carved mahogany stand for hats; he showed him the drawing-room, and
      pointed out all its beauties; though it was summer, the drawing-room
      looked cold, as will look rooms newly furnished, with walls newly papered,
      in houses newly built. The furniture was handsome, and suited to the rank
      of a rich trader. There was no pretence about it, and therefore no
      vulgarity, which is more than can be said for the houses of many an
      Honourable Mrs. Somebody in Mayfair, with rooms twelve feet square,
      ebokeful of buhl, that would have had its proper place in the Tuileries.
      Then Richard showed him the library, with mahogany book-cases, and plate
      glass, and the fashionable authors handsomely bound. Your new men are much
      better friends to living authors than your old families who live in the
      country, and at most subscribe to a book-club. Then Richard took him
      up-stairs, and led him through the bedrooms,&mdash;all very clean and
      comfortable, and with every modern convenience; and pausing in a very
      pretty single gentleman's chamber, said, "This is your den. And now, can
      you guess who I am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one but my uncle Richard could be so kind," answered Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the compliment did not flatter Richard. He was extremely disconcerted
      and disappointed. He had hoped that he should be taken for a lord at
      least, forgetful of all that he had said in disparagement of lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fish!" said he at last, biting his lip, "so you don't think that I look
      like a gentleman? Come, now, speak honestly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, wonderingly, saw he had given pain, and with the good breeding
      which comes instinctively from good nature, replied, "I judge you by your
      heart, sir, and your likeness to my grandfather,&mdash;otherwise I should
      never have presumed to fancy we could be relations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!" answered Richard. "You can just wash your hands, and then come down
      to dinner; you will hear the gong in ten ininutes. There's the bell,&mdash;ring
      for what you want." With that, he turned on his heel; and descending the
      stairs, gave a look into the dining-room, and admired the plated salver on
      the sideboard, and the king's pattern spoons and silver on the table. Then
      he walked to the looking-glass over the mantelpiece; and, wishing to
      survey the whole effect of his form, mounted a chair. He was just getting
      into an attitude which he thought imposing, when the butler entered, and,
      being London bred, had the discretion to try to escape unseen; but Richard
      caught sight of him in the looking-glass, and coloured up to the temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jarvis," said he, mildly, "Jarvis, put me in mind to have these
      inexpressibles altered."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A propos of the inexpressibles, Mr. Richard did not forget to provide his
      nephew with a much larger wardrobe than could have been thrust into Dr.
      Riccabocca's knapsack. There was a very good tailor in the town, and the
      clothes were very well made. And, but for an air more ingenuous, and a
      cheek that, despite study and night vigils, retained much of the sunburned
      bloom of the rustic, Leonard Fairfield might now have almost passed,
      without disparaging comment, by the bow-window at White's. Richard burst
      into an immoderate fit of laughter when he first saw the watch which the
      poor Italian had bestowed upon Leonard; but to atone for the laughter, he
      made him a present of a very pretty substitute, and bade him "lock up his
      turnip." Leonard was more hurt by the jeer at his old patron's gift than
      pleased by his uncle's. But Richard Avenel had no conception of sentiment.
      It was not for many days that Leonard could reconcile himself to his
      uncle's manner. Not that the peasant could pretend to judge of its mere
      conventional defects; but there is an ill breeding to which, whatever our
      rank and nurture, we are almost equally sensitive,&mdash;the ill breeding
      that comes from want of consideration for others. Now, the squire was as
      homely in his way as Richard Avenel, but the squire's bluntness rarely
      hurt the feelings; and when it did so, the squire perceived and hastened
      to repair his blunder. But Mr. Richard, whether kind or cross, was always
      wounding you in some little delicate fibre,&mdash;not from malice, but
      from the absence of any little delicate fibres of his own. He was really,
      in many respects, a most excellent man, and certainly a very valuable
      citizen&mdash;; but his merits wanted the fine tints and fluent curves
      that constitute beauty of character. He was honest, but sharp in his
      practice, and with a keen eye to his interests. He was just, but as a
      matter of business. He made no allowances, and did not leave to his
      justice the large margin of tenderness and mercy. He was generous, but
      rather from an idea of what was due to himself than with much thought of
      the pleasure he gave to others; and he even regarded generosity as a
      capital put out to interest. He expected a great deal of gratitude in
      return, and, when he obliged a man, considered that he had bought a slave.
      Every needy voter knew where to come, if he wanted relief or a loan; but
      woe to him if he had ventured to express hesitation when Mr. Avenel told
      him how he must vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this town Richard had settled after his return from America, in which
      country he had enriched himself,&mdash;first, by spirit and industry,
      lastly, by bold speculation and good luck. He invested his fortune in
      business,&mdash;became a partner in a large brewery, soon bought out his
      associates, and then took a principal share in a flourishing corn-mill. He
      prospered rapidly,&mdash;bought a property of some two or three hundred
      acres, built a house, and resolved to enjoy himself, and make a figure. He
      had now become the leading man of the town, and the boast to Audley
      Egerton that he could return one of the members, perhaps both, was by no
      means an exaggerated estimate of his power. Nor was his proposition,
      according to his own views, so unprincipled as it appeared to the
      statesman. He had taken a great dislike to both the sitting members,&mdash;a
      dislike natural to a sensible man of moderate politics, who had something
      to lose. For Mr. Slappe, the active member, who was head-over-ears in
      debt, was one of the furious democrats&mdash;rare before the Reform Bill,&mdash;and
      whose opinions were held dangerous even by the mass of a Liberal
      constituency; while Mr. Sleekie, the gentleman member who laid by L5000
      every year from his dividends in the Funds, was one of those men whom
      Richard justly pronounced to be "humbugs,"&mdash;men who curry favour with
      the extreme party by voting for measures sure not to be carried; while if
      there was the least probability of coming to a decision that would lower
      the money market. Mr. Sleekie was seized with a well-timed influenza.
      Those politicians are common enough now. Propose to march to the
      Millennium, and they are your men. Ask them to march a quarter of a mile,
      and they fall to feeling their pockets, and trembling for fear of the
      footpads. They are never so joyful as when there is no chance of a
      victory. Did they beat the minister, they would be carried out of the
      House in a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Avenel&mdash;despising both these gentlemen, and not taking kindly
      to the Whigs since the great Whig leaders were lords&mdash;had looked with
      a friendly eye to the government as it then existed, and especially to
      Audley Egerton, the enlightened representative of commerce. But in giving
      Audley and his colleagues the benefit of his influence, through
      conscience, he thought it all fair and right to have a quid pro quo, and,
      as he had so frankly confessed, it was his whim to rise up "Sir Richard."
      For this worthy citizen abused the aristocracy much on the same principle
      as the fair Olivia depreciated Squire Thornhill,&mdash;he had a sneaking
      affection for what he abused. The society of Screwstown was, like most
      provincial capitals, composed of two classes,&mdash;the commercial and the
      exclusive. These last dwelt chiefly apart, around the ruins of an old
      abbey; they affected its antiquity in their pedigrees, and had much of its
      ruin in their finances. Widows of rural thanes in the neighbourhood,
      genteel spinsters, officers retired on half-pay, younger sons of rich
      squires, who had now become old bachelors,&mdash;in short, a very
      respectable, proud, aristocratic set, who thought more of themselves than
      do all the Gowers and Howards, Courtenays and Seymours, put together. It
      had early been the ambition of Richard Avenel to be admitted into this
      sublime coterie; and, strange to say, he had partially succeeded. He was
      never more happy than when he was asked to their card-parties, and never
      more unhappy than when he was actually there. Various circumstances
      combined to raise Mr. Avenel into this elevated society. First, he was
      unmarried, still very handsome, and in that society there was a large
      proportion of unwedded females. Secondly, he was the only rich trader in
      Screwstown who kept a good cook, and professed to give dinners, and the
      half-pay captains and colonels swallowed the host for the sake of the
      venison. Thirdly, and principally, all these exclusives abhorred the two
      sitting members, and "idem nolle idem velle de republica, ea firma
      amicitia est;" that is, congeniality in politics pieces porcelain and
      crockery together better than the best diamond cement. The sturdy Richard
      Avenel, who valued himself on American independence, held these ladies and
      gentlemen in an awe that was truly Brahminical. Whether it was that, in
      England, all notions, even of liberty, are mixed up historically,
      traditionally, socially, with that fine and subtle element of aristocracy
      which, like the press, is the air we breathe; or whether Richard imagined
      that he really became magnetically imbued with the virtues of these silver
      pennies and gold seven-shilling pieces, distinct from the vulgar coinage
      in popular use, it is hard to say. But the truth must be told,&mdash;Richard
      Avenel was a notable tuft-hunter. He had a great longing to marry out of
      this society; but he had not yet seen any one sufficiently high-born and
      high-bred to satisfy his aspirations. In the meanwhile, he had convinced
      himself that his way would be smooth could he offer to make his ultimate
      choice "My Lady;" and he felt that it would be a proud hour in his life
      when he could walk before stiff Colonel Pompley to the sound of "Sir
      Richard." Still, however disappointed at the ill-success of his bluff
      diplomacy with Mr. Egerton, and however yet cherishing the most vindictive
      resentment against that individual, he did not, as many would have done,
      throw up his political convictions out of personal spite. He reserved his
      private grudge for some special occasion, and continued still to support
      the Administration, and to hate one of the ministers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, duly to appreciate the value of Richard Avenel, and in just
      counterpoise to all his foibles, one ought to have seen what he had
      effected for the town. Well might he boast of "new blood;" he had done as
      much for the town as he had for his fields. His energy, his quick
      comprehension of public utility, backed by his wealth and bold, bullying,
      imperious character, had sped the work of civilization as if with the
      celerity and force of a steam-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the town were so well paved and so well lighted, if half-a-dozen
      squalid lanes had been transformed into a stately street, if half the town
      no longer depended on tanks for their water, if the poor-rates were
      reduced one-third, praise to the brisk new blood which Richard Avenel had
      infused into vestry and corporation. And his example itself was so
      contagious!
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was not a plate-glass window in the town when I came into it," said
      Richard Avenel; "and now look down the High Street!" He took the credit to
      himself, and justly; for though his own business did not require windows
      of plate-glass, he had awakened the spirit of enterprise which adorns a
      whole city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Avenel did not present Leonard to his friends for more than a
      fortnight. He allowed him to wear off his rust. He then gave a grand
      dinner, at which his nephew was formally introduced, and, to his great
      wrath and disappointment, never opened his lips. How could he, poor youth,
      when Miss Clarina Mowbray only talked upon high life, till proud Colonel
      Pompley went in state through the history of the Siege of Seringapatam?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Leonard accustoms himself gradually to the splendours that surround
      him, and often turns with a sigh to the remembrance of his mother's
      cottage and the sparkling fount in the Italian's flowery garden, we will
      make with thee, O reader, a rapid flight to the metropolis, and drop
      ourselves amidst the gay groups that loiter along the dusty ground or loll
      over the roadside palings of Hyde Park. The season is still at its height;
      but the short day of fashionable London life, which commences two hours
      after noon, is in its decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd in Rotten Row begins to thin. Near the statue of Achilles, and
      apart from all other loungers, a gentleman, with one hand thrust into his
      waistcoat, and the other resting on his cane, gazed listlessly on the
      horsemen and carriages in the brilliant ring. He was still in the prime of
      life, at the age when man is usually the most social,&mdash;when the
      acquaintances of youth have ripened into friendships, and a personage of
      some rank and fortune has become a well-known feature in the mobile face
      of society. But though, when his contemporaries were boys scarce at
      college, this gentleman had blazed foremost amongst the princes of
      fashion, and though he had all the qualities of nature and circumstance
      which either retain fashion to the last, or exchange its false celebrity
      for a graver repute, he stood as a stranger in that throng of his
      countrymen. Beauties whirled by to the toilet, statesmen passed on to the
      senate, dandies took flight to the clubs; and neither nods, nor becks, nor
      wreathed smiles said to the solitary spectator, "Follow us,&mdash;thou art
      one of our set." Now and then some middle-aged beau, nearing the post of
      the loiterer, turned round to look again; but the second glance seemed to
      dissipate the recognition of the first, and the beau silently continued
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the tomb of my fathers!" said the solitary to himself, "I know now
      what a dead man might feel if he came to life again, and took a peep at
      the living."
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed on,&mdash;the evening shades descended fast. Our stranger in
      London had well-nigh the Park to himself. He seemed to breathe more freely
      as he saw that the space was so clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's oxygen in the atmosphere now," said he, half aloud; "and I can
      walk without breathing in the gaseous fumes of the multitude. Oh, those
      chemists&mdash;what dolts they are! They tell us that crowds taint the
      air, but they never guess why! Pah, it is not the lungs that poison the
      element,&mdash;it is the reek of bad hearts. When a periwigpated fellow
      breathes on me, I swallow a mouthful of care. Allons! my friend Nero; now
      for a stroll." He touched with his cane a large Newfoundland dog, who lay
      stretched near his feet, and dog and man went slow through the growing
      twilight, and over the brown dry turf. At length our solitary paused, and
      threw himself on a bench under a tree. "Half-past eight!" said he, looking
      at his watch, "one may smoke one's cigar without shocking the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out his cigar-case, struck a light, and in another moment reclined
      at length on the bench, seemed absorbed in regarding the smoke, that
      scarce coloured ere it vanished into air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the most barefaced lie in the world, my Nero," said he, addressing
      his dog, "this boasted liberty of man! Now, here am I, a free-born
      Englishman, a citizen of the world, caring&mdash;I often say to myself&mdash;caring
      not a jot for Kaiser or Mob; and yet I no more dare smoke this cigar in
      the Park at half-past six, when all the world is abroad, than I dare pick
      my Lord Chancellor's pocket, or hit the Archbishop of Canterbury a thump
      on the nose. Yet no law in England forbids me my cigar, Nero! What is law
      at half-past eight was not crime at six and a half! Britannia says, 'Man,
      thou art free, and she lies like a commonplace woman. O Nero, Nero! you
      enviable dog! you serve but from liking. No thought of the world costs you
      one wag of the tail. Your big heart and true instinct suffice you for
      reason and law. You would want nothing to your felicity, if in these
      moments of ennui you would but smoke a cigar. Try it, Nero!&mdash;try it!"
      And, rising from his incumbent posture, he sought to force the end of the
      weed between the teeth of the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus gravely engaged, two figures had approached the place. The one
      was a man who seemed weak and sickly. His threadbare coat was buttoned to
      the chin, but hung large on his shrunken breast. The other was a girl, who
      might be from twelve to fourteen, on whose arm he leaned heavily. Her
      cheek was wan, and there was a patient, sad look on her face, which seemed
      so settled that you would think she could never have known the
      mirthfulness of childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray rest here, Papa," said the child, softly; and she pointed to the
      bench, without taking heed of its pre-occupant, who now, indeed, confined
      to one corner of the seat, was almost hidden by the shadow of the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man sat down, with a feeble sigh, and then, observing the stranger,
      raised his hat, and said, in that tone of voice which betrays the usages
      of polished society, "Forgive me if I intrude on you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked up from his dog, and seeing that the girl was
      standing, rose at once, as if to make room for her on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still the girl did not heed him. She hung over her father, and wiped
      his brow tenderly with a little kerchief which she took from her own neck
      for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nero, delighted to escape the cigar, had taken to some unwieldy curvets
      and gambols, to vent the excitement into which he had been thrown; and now
      returning, approached the bench with a low growl of surprise, and sniffed
      at the intruders of his master's privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, sir," said the master. "You need not fear him," he added,
      addressing himself to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl, without turning round to him, cried in a voice rather of
      anguish than alarm, "He has fainted! Father! Father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger kicked aside his dog, which was in the way, and loosened the
      poor man's stiff military stock. While thus charitably engaged, the moon
      broke out, and the light fell full on the pale, careworn face of the
      unconscious sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This face seems not unfamiliar to me, though sadly changed," said the
      stranger to himself; and bending towards the girl, who had sunk on her
      knees, and was chafing her father's hand, he asked, "My child, what is
      your father's name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The child continued her task, too absorbed to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger put his hand on her shoulder, and repeated the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Digby," answered the child, almost unconsciously; and as she spoke the
      man's senses began to return. In a few minutes more he had sufficiently
      recovered to falter forth his thanks to the stranger. But the last took
      his hand, and said, in a voice at once tremulous and soothing, "Is it
      possible that I see once more an old brother in arms? Algernon Digby, I do
      not forget you; but it seems England has forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      A hectic flush spread over the soldier's face, and he looked away from the
      speaker as he answered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Digby, it is true, sir; but I do not think we have met before.
      Come, Helen, I am well now,&mdash;we will go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try and play with that great dog, my child," said the stranger,&mdash;"I
      want to talk with your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child bowed her submissive head, and moved away; but she did not play
      with the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must reintroduce myself formally, I see," quoth the stranger. "You were
      in the same regiment with myself, and my name is L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord," said the soldier, rising, "forgive me that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that it was the fashion to call me 'my lord' at the
      mess-table. Come, what has happened to you?&mdash;on half-pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Digby shook his head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Digby, old fellow, can you lend me L100?" said Lord L'Estrange, clapping
      his ci-devant brother-officer on the shoulder, and in a tone of voice that
      seemed like a boy's, so impudent was it, and devil-me-Garish. "No! Well,
      that's lucky, for I can lend it to you." Mr. Digby burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange did not seem to observe the emotion, but went on
      carelessly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you don't know that, besides being heir to a father who is not
      only very rich, but very liberal, I inherited, on coming of age, from a
      maternal relation, a fortune so large that it would bore me to death if I
      were obliged to live up to it. But in the days of our old acquaintance, I
      fear we were both sad extravagant fellows, and I dare say I borrowed of
      you pretty freely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me! Oh, Lord L'Estrange!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have married since then, and reformed, I suppose. Tell me, old
      friend, all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Digby, who by this time had succeeded in restoring some calm to his
      shattered nerves, now rose, and said in brief sentences, but clear, firm
      tones,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, it is idle to talk of me,&mdash;useless to help me. I am fast
      dying. But my child there, my only child" (he paused for an instant, and
      went on rapidly). "I have relations in a distant county, if I could but
      get to them; I think they would, at least, provide for her. This has been
      for weeks my hope, my dream, my prayer. I cannot afford the journey except
      by your help. I have begged without shame for myself; shall I be ashamed,
      then, to beg for her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Digby," said L'Estrange, with some grave alteration of manner, "talk
      neither of dying nor begging. You were nearer death when the balls
      whistled round you at Waterloo. If soldier meets soldier and says 'Friend,
      thy purse,' it is not begging, but brotherhood. Ashamed! By the soul of
      Belisarius! if I needed money, I would stand at a crossing with my
      Waterloo medal over my breast, and say to each sleek citizen I had helped
      to save from the sword of the Frenchman, 'It is your shame if I starve.'
      Now, lean upon me; I see you should be at home: which way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor soldier pointed his hand towards Oxford Street, and reluctantly
      accepted the proffered arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when you return from your relations, you will call on me? What&mdash;hesitate?
      Come, promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On your honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I live, on my honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am staying at present at Knightsbridge, with my father; but you will
      always hear of my address at No.&mdash;, Grosvenor Square, Mr. Egerton's.
      So you have a long journey before you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not fatigue yourself,&mdash;travel slowly. Ho, you foolish child! I
      see you are jealous of me. Your father has another arm to spare you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus talking, and getting but short answers, Lord L'Estrange continued to
      exhibit those whimsical peculiarities of character, which had obtained for
      him the repute of heartlessness in the world. Perhaps the reader may think
      the world was not in the right; but if ever the world does judge rightly
      of the character of a man who does not live for the world nor talk of the
      world nor feel with the world, it will be centuries after the soul of
      Harley L'Estrange has done with this planet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange parted company with Mr. Digby at the entrance of Oxford
      Street. The father and child there took a cabriolet. Mr. Digby directed
      the driver to go down the Edgware Road. He refused to tell L'Estrange his
      address, and this with such evident pain, from the sores of pride, that
      L'Estrange could not press the point. Reminding the soldier of his promise
      to call, Harley thrust a pocket-book into his hand, and walked off hastily
      towards Grosvenor Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached Audley Egerton's door just as that gentleman was getting out of
      his carriage; and the two friends entered the house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does the nation take a nap to-night?" asked L'Estrange. "Poor old lady!
      She hears so much of her affairs, that she may well boast of her
      constitution: it must be of iron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The House is still sitting," answered Audley, seriously, and with small
      heed of his friend's witticism. "But it is not a Government motion, and
      the division will be late, so I came home; and if I had not found you
      here, I should have gone into the Park to look for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; one always knows where to find me at this hour, nine o'clock P.M.,
      cigar, Hyde Park. There is not a man in England so regular in his habits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the friends reached a drawing-room in which the member of parliament
      seldom sat, for his private apartments were all on the ground-floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is the strangest whim of yours, Harley," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To affect detestation of ground-floors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Affect! O sophisticated man, of the earth, earthy! Affect!&mdash;nothing
      less natural to the human soul than a ground-floor. We are quite far
      enough from Heaven, mount as many stairs as we will, without grovelling by
      preference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "According to that symbolical view of the case," said Audley, "you should
      lodge in an attic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I would, but that I abhor new slippers. As for hairbrushes, I am
      indifferent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have slippers and hair-brushes to do with attics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try! Make your bed in an attic, and the next morning you will have
      neither slippers nor hair-brushes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I have done with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shied them at the cats!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What odd things you say, Harley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Odd! By Apollo and his nine spinsters! there is no human being who has so
      little imagination as a distinguished member of parliament. Answer me
      this, thou solemn Right Honourable,&mdash;Hast thou climbed to the heights
      of august contemplation? Hast thou gazed on the stars with the rapt eye of
      song? Hast thou dreamed of a love known to the angels, or sought to seize
      in the Infinite the mystery of life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I indeed, my poor Harley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then no wonder, poor Audley, that you cannot conjecture why he who makes
      his bed in an attic, disturbed by base catterwauls, shies his slippers at
      cats. Bring a chair into the balcony. Nero spoiled my cigar to-night. I am
      going to smoke now. You never smoke. You can look on the shrubs in the
      square."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley slightly shrugged his shoulders, but he followed his friend's
      counsel and example, and brought his chair into the balcony. Nero came
      too, but at sight and smell of the cigar prudently retreated, and took
      refuge under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Audley Egerton, I want something from Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am delighted to hear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was a cornet in my regiment, who would have done better not to have
      come into it. We were, for the most part of us, puppies and fops."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You all fought well, however."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Puppies and fops do fight well. Vanity and valour generally go together.
      CAesar, who scratched his head with due care of his scanty curls, and even
      in dying thought of the folds in his toga; Walter Raleigh, who could not
      walk twenty yards because of the gems in his shoes; Alcibiades, who
      lounged into the Agora with doves in his bosom, and an apple in his hand;
      Murat, bedizened in gold lace and furs; and Demetrius, the City-Taker, who
      made himself up like a French marquise, were all pretty good fellows at
      fighting. A slovenly hero like Cromwell is a paradox in nature, and a
      marvel in history. But to return to my cornet. We were rich; he was poor.
      When the pot of clay swims down the stream with the brass-pots, it is sure
      of a smash. Men said Digby was stingy; I saw he was extravagant. But every
      one, I fear, would be rather thought stingy than poor. Bref&mdash;I left
      the army, and saw him no more till to-night. There was never shabby poor
      gentleman on the stage more awfully shabby, more pathetically gentleman.
      But, look ye, this man has fought for England. It was no child's play at
      Waterloo, let me tell you, Mr. Egerton; and, but for such men, you would
      be at best a sous prefet, and your parliament a Provincial Assembly. You
      must do something for Digby. What shall it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, really, my dear Harley, this man was no great friend of yours, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he were, he would not want the Government to help him,&mdash;he would
      not be ashamed of taking money from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all very fine, Harley; but there are so many poor officers, and
      so little to give. It is the most difficult thing in the world that which
      you ask me. Indeed, I know nothing can be done: he has his half-pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not; or, if he has it, no doubt it all goes on his debts. That's
      nothing to us: the man and his child are starving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if it is his own fault,&mdash;if he has been imprudent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well, well; where the devil is Nero?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so sorry I can't oblige you. If it were anything else&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something else. My valet&mdash;I can't turn him adrift-excellent
      fellow, but gets drunk now and then. Will you find him a place in the
      Stamp Office?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, now I think of it, the man knows my ways: I must keep him. But my old
      wine-merchant&mdash;civil man, never dunned&mdash;is a bankrupt. I am
      under great obligations to him, and he has a very pretty daughter. Do you
      think you could thrust him into some small place in the Colonies, or make
      him a King's Messenger, or something of the sort?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you very much wish it, no doubt I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Audley, I am but feeling my way: the fact is, I want something
      for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that indeed gives me pleasure!" cried Egerton, with animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mission to Florence will soon be vacant,&mdash;I know it privately.
      The place would quite suit me. Pleasant city; the best figs in Italy; very
      little to do. You could sound Lord on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer beforehand. Lord&mdash;would be enchanted to secure to the
      public service a man so accomplished as yourself, and the son of a peer
      like Lord Lansmere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley L'Estrange sprang to his feet, and flung his cigar in the face of a
      stately policeman who was looking up at the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Infamous and bloodless official!" cried Harley L'Estrange; "so you could
      provide for a pimple-nosed lackey, for a wine-merchant who has been
      poisoning the king's subjects with white lead,&mdash;or sloe-juice,&mdash;for
      an idle sybarite, who would complain of a crumpled rose-leaf; and nothing,
      in all the vast patronage of England, for a broken-down soldier, whose
      dauntless breast was her rampart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley," said the member of parliament, with his calm, sensible smile,
      "this would be a very good claptrap at a small theatre; but there is
      nothing in which parliament demands such rigid economy as the military
      branch of the public service; and no man for whom it is so hard to effect
      what we must plainly call a job as a subaltern officer who has done
      nothing more than his duty,&mdash;and all military men do that. Still, as
      you take it so earnestly, I will use what interest I can at the War
      Office, and get him, perhaps, the mastership of a barrack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better; for, if you do not, I swear I will turn Radical, and come
      down to your own city to oppose you, with Hunt and Cobbett to canvass for
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be very glad to see you come into parliament, even as a Radical,
      and at my expense," said Audley, with great kindness; "but the air is
      growing cold, and you are not accustomed to our climate. Nay, if you are
      too poetic for catarrhs and rheums, I'm not,&mdash;come in."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange threw himself on a sofa, and leaned his cheek on his hand
      thoughtfully. Audley Egerton sat near him, with his arms folded, and gazed
      on his friend's face with a soft expression of aspect, which was very
      unusual to the firm outline of his handsome features. The two men were as
      dissimilar in person as the reader will have divined that they were in
      character. All about Egerton was so rigid, all about L'Estrange so easy.
      In every posture of Harley's there was the unconscious grace of a child.
      The very fashion of his garments showed his abhorrence of restraint. His
      clothes were wide and loose; his neckcloth, tied carelessly, left his
      throat half bare. You could see that he had lived much in warm and
      southern lands, and contracted a contempt for conventionalities; there was
      as little in his dress as in his talk of the formal precision of the
      North. He was three or four years younger than Audley, but he looked at
      least twelve years younger. In fact, he was one of those men to whom old
      age seems impossible; voice, look, figure, had all the charm of youth: and
      perhaps it was from this gracious youthfulness&mdash;at all events, it was
      characteristic of the kind of love he inspired&mdash;that neither his
      parents, nor the few friends admitted into his intimacy, ever called him,
      in their habitual intercourse, by the name of his title. He was not
      L'Estrange with them, he was Harley; and by that familiar baptismal I will
      usually designate him. He was not one of those men whom author or reader
      wish to view at a distance, and remember as "my Lord"&mdash;it was so
      rarely that he remembered it himself. For the rest, it had been said of
      him by a shrewd wit, "He is so natural that every one calls him affected."
      Harley L'Estrange was not so critically handsome as Audley Egerton; to a
      commonplace observer, he was only rather good-looking than otherwise. But
      women said that he had "a beautiful countenance," and they were not wrong.
      He wore his hair, which was of a fair chestnut, long, and in loose curls;
      and instead of the Englishman's whiskers, indulged in the foreigner's
      mustache. His complexion was delicate, though not effeminate: it was
      rather the delicacy of a student than of a woman. But in his clear gray
      eye there was a wonderful vigour of life. A skilful physiologist, looking
      only into that eye, would have recognized rare stamina of constitution,&mdash;a
      nature so rich that, while easily disturbed, it would require all the
      effects of time, or all the fell combinations of passion and grief, to
      exhaust it. Even now, though so thoughtful, and even so sad, the rays of
      that eye were as concentrated and steadfast as the light of the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were only, then, in jest," said Audley, after a long silence, "when
      you spoke of this mission to Florence. You have still no idea of entering
      into public life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had hoped better things when I got your promise to pass one season in
      London; but, indeed, you have kept your promise to the ear to break it to
      the spirit. I could not presuppose that you would shun all society, and be
      as much of a hermit here as under the vines of Como."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sat in the Strangers' Gallery, and heard your great speakers; I
      have been in the pit of the opera, and seen your fine ladies; I have
      walked your streets; I have lounged in your parks, and I say that I can't
      fall in love with a faded dowager, because she fills up her wrinkles with
      rouge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what dowager do you speak?" asked the matter-of-fact Audley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has a great many titles. Some people call her Fashion, you busy men,
      Politics: it is all one,&mdash;tricked out and artificial. I mean London
      Life. No, I can't fall in love with her, fawning old harridan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you could fall in love with something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could, with all my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are so blaze."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, I am so fresh. Look out of the window&mdash;what do you
      see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but houses and dusty lilacs, my coachman dozing on his box, and
      two women in pattens crossing the kennel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see not those where I lie on the sofa. I see but the stars. And I feel
      for them as I did when I was a schoolboy at Eton. It is you who are blaze,
      not I. Enough of this. You do not forget my commission with respect to the
      exile who has married into your brother's family?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but here you set me a task more difficult than that of saddling your
      cornet on the War Office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it is difficult, for the counter influence is vigilant and strong;
      but, on the other hand, the enemy is so damnable a traitor that one must
      have the Fates and the household gods on one's side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless," said the practical Audley, bending over a book on the
      table; "I think that the best plan would be to attempt a compromise with
      the traitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To judge of others by myself," answered Harley, with spirit, "it were
      less bitter to put up with wrong than to palter with it for compensation.
      And such wrong! Compromise with the open foe&mdash;that maybe done with
      honour; but with the perjured friend&mdash;that were to forgive the
      perjury!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too vindictive," said Egerton; "there may be excuses for the
      friend, which palliate even&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! Audley, hush! or I shall think the world has indeed corrupted you.
      Excuse for the friend who deceives, who betrays! No, such is the true
      outlaw of Humanity; and the Furies surround him even while he sleeps in
      the temple."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of the world lifted his eyes slowly on the animated face of one
      still natural enough for the passions. He then once more returned to his
      book, and said, after a pause, "It is time you should marry, Harley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered L'Estrange, with a smile at this sudden turn in the
      conversation, "not time yet; for my chief objection to that change in life
      is, that the women nowadays are too old for me, or I am too young for
      them. A few, indeed, are so infantine that one is ashamed to be their toy;
      but most are so knowing that one is afraid to be their dupe. The first, if
      they condescend to love you, love you as the biggest doll they have yet
      dandled, and for a doll's good qualities,&mdash;your pretty blue eyes and
      your exquisite millinery. The last, if they prudently accept you, do so on
      algebraical principles; you are but the X or the Y that represents a
      certain aggregate of goods matrimonial,&mdash;pedigree, title, rent-roll,
      diamonds, pin-money, opera-box. They cast you up with the help of mamma,
      and you wake some morning to find that plus wife minus affection equals&mdash;the
      Devil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," said Audley, with his quiet, grave laugh. "I grant that it is
      often the misfortune of a man in your station to be married rather for
      what he has than for what he is; but you are tolerably penetrating, and
      not likely to be deceived in the character of the woman you court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the woman I court?&mdash;No! But of the woman I marry, very likely
      indeed! Woman is a changeable thing, as our Virgil informed us at school;
      but her change par excellence is from the fairy you woo to the brownie you
      wed. It is not that she has been a hypocrite,&mdash;it is that she is a
      transmigration. You marry a girl for her accomplishments. She paints
      charmingly, or plays like Saint Cecilia. Clap a ring on her finger, and
      she never draws again,&mdash;except perhaps your caricature on the back of
      a letter,&mdash;and never opens a piano after the honeymoon. You marry her
      for her sweet temper; and next year, her nerves are so shattered that you
      can't contradict her but you are whirled into a storm of hysterics. You
      marry her because she declares she hates balls and likes quiet; and ten to
      one but what she becomes a patroness at Almack's, or a lady-in-waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet most men marry, and most men survive the operation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were only necessary to live, that would be a consolatory and
      encouraging reflection. But to live with peace, to live with dignity, to
      live with freedom, to live in harmony with your thoughts, your habits,
      your aspirations&mdash;and this in the perpetual companionship of a person
      to whom you have given the power to wound your peace, to assail your
      dignity, to cripple your freedom, to jar on each thought and each habit,
      and bring you down to the meanest details of earth, when you invite her,
      poor soul, to soar to the spheres&mdash;that makes the To Be or Not To Be,
      which is the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were you, Harley, I would do as I have heard the author of 'Sandford
      and Merton' did,&mdash;choose out a child and educate her yourself, after
      your own heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have hit it," answered Harley, seriously. "That has long been my
      idea,&mdash;a very vague one, I confess. But I fear I shall be an old man
      before I find even the child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he continued, yet more earnestly, while the whole character of his
      varying countenance changed again,&mdash;"ah, if indeed I could discover
      what I seek,&mdash;one who, with the heart of a child, has the mind of a
      woman; one who beholds in nature the variety, the charm, the never
      feverish, ever healthful excitement that others vainly seek in the bastard
      sentimentalities of a life false with artificial forms; one who can
      comprehend, as by intuition, the rich poetry with which creation is
      clothed,&mdash;poetry so clear to the child when enraptured with the
      flower, or when wondering at the star! If on me such exquisite
      companionship were bestowed&mdash;why, then&mdash;" He paused, sighed
      deeply, and, covering his face with his hand, resumed, in faltering
      accents,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But once&mdash;but once only, did such vision of the Beautiful made Human
      rise before me,&mdash;rise amidst 'golden exhalations of the dawn.' It
      beggared my life in vanishing. You know only&mdash;you only&mdash;how&mdash;how&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head, and the tears forced themselves through his clenched
      fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long ago!" said Audley, sharing his friend's emotion. "Years so long
      and so weary, yet still thus tenacious of a mere boyish memory!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away with it, then!" cried Harley, springing to his feet, and with a
      laugh of strange merriment. "Your carriage still waits: set me home before
      you go to the House."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then laying his hand lightly on his friend's shoulder, he said, "Is it for
      you, Audley Egerton, to speak sneeringly of boyish memories? What else is
      it that binds us together? What else warms my heart when I meet you? What
      else draws your thoughts from blue-books and beer-bills to waste them on a
      vagrant like me? Shake hands. Oh, friend of my boyhood! recollect the oars
      that we plied and the bats that we wielded in the old time, or the
      murmured talk on the moss-grown bank, as we sat together, building in the
      summer air castles mightier than Windsor. Ah, they are strong ties, those
      boyish memories believe me! I remember, as if it were yesterday, my
      translation of that lovely passage in Persius, beginning&mdash;let me see&mdash;ah!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'Quum primum pavido custos mihi purpura cernet,'&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      that passage on friendship which gushes out so livingly from the stern
      heart of the satirist. And when old&mdash;complimented me on my verses, my
      eye sought yours. Verily, I now say as then,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "'Nescio quod, certe est quod me tibi temperet astrum.'"

     ["What was the star I know not, but certainly some star
     it was that attuned me unto thee."]
</pre>
    <p>
      Audley turned away his head as he returned the grasp of his friend's hand;
      and while Harley, with his light elastic footstep, descended the stairs,
      Egerton lingered behind, and there was no trace of the worldly man upon
      his countenance when he took his place in the carriage by his companion's
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours afterwards, weary cries of "Question, question!" "Divide,
      divide!" sank into reluctant silence as Audley Egerton rose to conclude
      the debate,&mdash;the man of men to speak late at night, and to impatient
      benches: a man who would be heard; whom a Bedlam broke loose would not
      have roared down; with a voice clear and sound as a bell, and a form as
      firmly set on the ground as a church-tower. And while, on the dullest of
      dull questions, Audley Egerton thus, not too lively himself, enforced
      attention, where was Harley L'Estrange? Standing alone by the river at
      Richmond, and murmuring low fantastic thoughts as he gazed on the moonlit
      tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Audley left him at home he had joined his parents, made them gay with
      his careless gayety, seen the old-fashioned folks retire to rest, and then&mdash;while
      they, perhaps, deemed him once more the hero of ball-rooms and the
      cynosure of clubs&mdash;he drove slowly through the soft summer night,
      amidst the perfumes of many a garden and many a gleaming chestnut grove,
      with no other aim before him than to reach the loveliest margin of
      England's loveliest river, at the hour when the moon was fullest and the
      song of the nightingale most sweet. And so eccentric a humourist was this
      man, that I believe, as he there loitered,&mdash;no one near to cry "How
      affected!" or "How romantic!"&mdash;he enjoyed himself more than if he had
      been exchanging the politest "how-d'ye-dos" in the hottest of London
      drawing-rooms, or betting his hundreds on the odd trick, with Lord de R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      for his partner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard had been about six weeks with his uncle, and those weeks were well
      spent. Mr. Richard had taken him to his counting-house, and initiated him
      into business and the mysteries of double entry; and in return for the
      young man's readiness and zeal in matters which the acute trader
      instinctively felt were not exactly to his tastes, Richard engaged the
      best master the town afforded to read with his nephew in the evening. This
      gentleman was the head usher of a large school, who had his hours to
      himself after eight o'clock, and was pleased to vary the dull routine of
      enforced lessons by instructions to a pupil who took delightedly even to
      the Latin grammar. Leonard made rapid strides, and learned more in those
      six weeks than many a cleverish boy does in twice as many months. These
      hours which Leonard devoted to study Richard usually spent from home,&mdash;sometimes
      at the houses of his grand acquaintances in the Abbey Gardens, sometimes
      in the Reading-Room appropriated to those aristocrats. If he stayed at
      home, it was in company with his head clerk, and for the purpose of
      checking his account-books, or looking over the names of doubtful
      electors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard had naturally wished to communicate his altered prospects to his
      old friends, that they, in turn, might rejoice his mother with such good
      tidings. But he had not been two days in the house before Richard had
      strictly forbidden all such correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look you," said he, "at present we are on an experiment,&mdash;we must
      see if we like each other. Suppose we don't, you will only have raised
      expectations in your mother which must end in bitter disappointment; and
      suppose we do, it will be time enough to write when something definite is
      settled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my mother will be so anxious&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make your mind easy on that score. I will write regularly to Mr. Dale,
      and he can tell her that you are well and thriving. No more words, my man,&mdash;when
      I say a thing, I say it." Then, observing that Leonard looked blank and
      dissatisfied, Richard added, with a good-humoured smile, "I have my
      reasons for all this&mdash;you shall know them later. And I tell you what:
      if you do as I bid you, it is my intention to settle something handsome on
      your mother; but if you don't, devil a penny she'll get from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that Richard turned on his heel, and in a few moments his voice was
      heard loud in objurgation with some of his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the fourth week of Leonard's residence at Mr. Avenel's, his host
      began to evince a certain change of manner. He was no longer quite so
      cordial with Leonard, nor did he take the same interest in his progress.
      About the same period he was frequently caught by the London butler before
      the looking-glass. He had always been a smart man in his dress, but he was
      now more particular. He would spoil three white cravats when he went out
      of an evening, before he could satisfy himself as to the tie. He also
      bought a 'Peerage,' and it became his favourite study at odd quarters of
      an hour. All these symptoms proceeded from a cause, and that cause was&mdash;woman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first people at Screwstown were indisputably the Pompleys. Colonel
      Pompley was grand, but Mrs. Pompley was grander. The colonel was stately
      in right of his military rank and his services in India; Mrs. Pompley was
      majestic in right of her connections. Indeed, Colonel Pompley himself
      would have been crushed under the weight of the dignities which his lady
      heaped upon him, if he had not been enabled to prop his position with a
      "connection" of his own. He would never have held his own, nor been
      permitted to have an independent opinion on matters aristocratic, but for
      the well-sounding name of his relations, "the Digbies." Perhaps on the
      principle that obscurity increases the natural size of objects and is an
      element of the sublime, the colonel did not too accurately define his
      relations "the Digbies:" he let it be casually understood that they were
      the Digbies to be found in Debrett. But if some indiscreet Vulgarian (a
      favourite word with both the Pompleys) asked point-blank if he meant "my
      Lord Digby," the colonel, with a lofty air, answered, "The elder branch,
      sir." No one at Screwstown had ever seen these Digbies: they lay amidst
      the Far, the Recondite,&mdash;even to the wife of Colonel Pompley's bosom.
      Now and then, when the colonel referred to the lapse of years, and the
      uncertainty of human affections, he would say, "When young Digby and I
      were boys together," and then add with a sigh, "but we shall never meet
      again in this world. His family interests secured him a valuable
      appointment in a distant part of the British dominions." Mrs. Pompley was
      always rather cowed by the Digbies. She could not be sceptical as to this
      connection, for the colonel's mother was certainly a Digby, and the
      colonel impaled the Digby arms. En revanche, as the French say, for these
      marital connections, Mrs. Pompley had her own favourite affinity, which
      she specially selected from all others when she most desired to produce
      effect; nay, even upon ordinary occasions the name rose spontaneously to
      her lips,&mdash;the name of the Honourable Mrs. M'Catchley. Was the
      fashion of a gown or cap admired, her cousin, Mrs. M'Catchley, had just
      sent to her the pattern from Paris. Was it a question whether the Ministry
      would stand, Mrs. M'Catchley was in the secret, but Mrs. Pompley had been
      requested not to say. Did it freeze, "My cousin, Mrs. M'Catchley, had
      written word that the icebergs at the Pole were supposed to be coming this
      way." Did the sun glow with more than usual fervour, Mrs. M'Catchley had
      informed her "that it was Sir Henry Halford's decided opinion that it was
      on account of the cholera." The good people knew all that was doing at
      London, at court, in this world&mdash;nay, almost in the other&mdash;through
      the medium of the Honourable Mrs. M'Catchley. Mrs. M'Catchley was,
      moreover, the most elegant of women, the wittiest creature, the dearest.
      King George the Fourth had presumed to admire Mrs. M'Catehley; but Mrs.
      M'Catchley, though no prude, let him see that she was proof against the
      corruptions of a throne. So long had the ears of Mrs. Pompley's friends
      been filled with the renown of Mrs. M'Catchley, that at last Mrs.
      M'Catchley was secretly supposed to be a myth, a creature of the elements,
      a poetic fiction of Mrs. Pompley's. Richard Avenel, however, though by no
      means a credulous man, was an implicit believer in Mrs. M'Catchley. He had
      learned that she was a widow, and honourable by birth, and honourable by
      marriage, living on her handsome jointure, and refusing offers every day
      that she so lived. Somehow or other, whenever Richard Avenel thought of a
      wife, he thought of the Honourable Mrs. M'Catchley. Perhaps that romantic
      attachment to the fair invisible preserved him heart-whole amongst the
      temptations of Screwstown. Suddenly, to the astonishment of the Abbey
      Gardens, Mrs. M'Catchley proved her identity, and arrived at Colonel
      Pompley's in a handsome travelling-carriage, attended by her maid and
      footman. She had come to stay some weeks; a tea-party was given in her
      honour. Mr. Avenel and his nephew were invited. Colonel Pompley, who kept
      his head clear in the midst of the greatest excitement, had a desire to
      get from the Corporation a lease of a piece of ground adjoining his
      garden, and he no sooner saw Richard Avenel enter than he caught him by
      the button, and drew him into a quiet corner, in order to secure his
      interest. Leonard, meanwhile, was borne on by the stream, till his
      progress was arrested by a sofa-table at which sat Mrs. M'Catchley
      herself, with Mrs. Pompley by her side. For on this great occasion the
      hostess had abandoned her proper post at the entrance, and, whether to
      show her respect to Mrs. M'Catchley, or to show Mrs. M'Catchley her
      well-bred contempt for the people of Screwstown, remained in state by her
      friend, honouring only the elite of the town with introductions to the
      illustrious visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Catchley was a very fine woman,&mdash;a woman who justified Mrs.
      Pompley's pride in her. Her cheek-bones were rather high, it is true but
      that proved the purity of her Caledonian descent; for the rest, she had a
      brilliant complexion, heightened by a soupcon of rouge, good eyes and
      teeth, a showy figure, and all the ladies of Screwstown pronounced her
      dress to be perfect. She might have arrived at that age at which one
      intends to stop for the next ten years, but even a Frenchman would not
      have called her passee,&mdash;that is, for a widow. For a spinster it
      would have been different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking round her with a glass, which Mrs. Pompley was in the habit of
      declaring that "Mrs. M'Catchley used like an angel," this lady suddenly
      perceived Leonard Fairfield; and his quiet, simple, thoughtful air and
      look so contrasted with the stiff beaux to whom she had been presented,
      that, experienced in fashion as so fine a personage must be supposed to
      be, she was nevertheless deceived into whispering to Mrs. Pompley,
    </p>
    <p>
      "That young man has really an air distingue; who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Mrs. Pompley, in unaffected surprise, "that is the nephew of
      the rich Vulgarian I was telling you of this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! and you say that he is Mr. Arundel's heir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Avenel&mdash;not Arundel&mdash;my sweet friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Avenel is not a bad name," said Mrs. M'Catchley. "But is the uncle really
      so rich?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The colonel was trying this very day to guess what he is worth; but he
      says it is impossible to guess it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the young man is his heir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is thought so; and reading for College, I hear. They say he is
      clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Present him, my love; I like clever people," said Mrs. M'Catchley,
      falling back languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten minutes afterwards, Richard Avenel having effected his escape
      from the colonel, and his gaze being attracted towards the sofa-table by
      the buzz of the admiring crowd, beheld his nephew in animated conversation
      with the long cherished idol of his dreams. A fierce pang of jealousy shot
      through his breast. His nephew had never looked so handsome and so
      intelligent; in fact, poor Leonard had never before been drawn out by a
      woman of the world, who had learned how to make the most of what little
      she knew. And as jealousy operates like a pair of bellows on incipient
      flames, so, at first sight of the smile which the fair widow bestowed upon
      Leonard, the heart of Mr. Avenel felt in a blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached with a step less assured than usual, and, overhearing
      Leonard's talk, marvelled much at the boy's audacity. Mrs. M'Catchley had
      been speaking of Scotland and the Waverley Novels, about which Leonard
      knew nothing. But he knew Burns, and on Burns he grew artlessly eloquent.
      Burns the poet and peasant&mdash;Leonard might well be eloquent on him.
      Mrs. M'Catchley was amused and pleased with his freshness and naivete, so
      unlike anything she had ever heard or seen, and she drew him on and on
      till Leonard fell to quoting. And Richard heard, with less respect for the
      sentiment than might be supposed, that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Rank is but the guinea's stamp,
          The man's the gowd for a' that."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Well!" exclaimed Mr. Avenel. "Pretty piece of politeness to tell that to
      a lady like the Honourable Mrs. M'Catch ley! You'll excuse him, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" said Mrs. M'Catchley, startled, and lifting her glass. Leonard,
      rather confused, rose and offered his chair to Richard, who dropped into
      it. The lady, without waiting for formal introduction, guessed that she
      saw the rich uncle. "Such a sweet poet-Burns!" said she, dropping her
      glass. "And it is so refreshing to find so much youthful enthusiasm," she
      added, pointing her fan towards Leonard, who was receding fast among the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he is youthful, my nephew,&mdash;rather green!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say green!" said Mrs. M'Catchley. Richard blushed scarlet. He was
      afraid he had committed himself to some expression low and shocking. The
      lady resumed, "Say unsophisticated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A tarnation long word," thought Richard; but he prudently bowed and held
      his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young men nowadays," continued Mrs. M'Catchley, resettling herself on the
      sofa, "affect to be so old. They don't dance, and they don't read, and
      they don't talk much! and a great many of them wear toupets before they
      are two-and-twenty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard mechanically passed his hand through his thick curls. But he was
      still mute; he was still ruefully chewing the cud of the epithet "green."
      What occult horrid meaning did the word convey to ears polite? Why should
      he not say "green"?
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very fine young man your nephew, sir," resumed Mrs. M' Catchley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And seems full of talent. Not yet at the University? Will he go to Oxford
      or Cambridge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not made up my mind yet if I shall send him to the University at
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A young man of his expectations!" exclaimed Mrs. M'Catchley, artfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Expectations!" repeated Richard, firing up. "Has he been talking to you
      of his expectations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, sir. But the nephew of the rich Mr. Avenel! Ah, one hears a
      great deal, you know, of rich people; it is the penalty of wealth, Mr.
      Avenel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was very much flattered. His crest rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they say," continued Mrs. M'Catchley, dropping out her words very
      slowly, as she adjusted her blonde scarf, "that Mr. Avenel has resolved
      not to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil they do, ma'am!" bolted out Richard, gruffly; and then, ashamed
      of his lapsus linguae, screwed up his lips firmly, and glared on the
      company with an eye of indignant fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M'Catchley observed him over her fan. Richard turned abruptly, and
      she withdrew her eyes modestly, and raised the fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a real beauty," said Richard, between his teeth. The fan fluttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes afterwards, the widow and the bachelor seemed so much at
      their ease that Mrs. Pompley, who had been forced to leave her friend, in
      order to receive the dean's lady, could scarcely believe her eyes when she
      returned to the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it was from that evening that Mr. Richard Avenel exhibited the change
      of mood which I have described; and from that evening he abstained from
      taking Leonard with him to any of the parties in the Abbey Gardens.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some days after this memorable soiree, Colonel Pompley sat alone in his
      study (which opened pleasantly on an old-fashioned garden), absorbed in
      the house bills. For Colonel Pompley did not leave that domestic care to
      his lady,&mdash;perhaps she was too grand for it. Colonel Pompley with his
      own sonorous voice ordered the joints, and with his own heroic hands
      dispensed the stores. In justice to the colonel, I must add&mdash;at
      whatever risk of offence to the fair sex&mdash;that there was not a house
      at Screwstown so well managed as the Pompleys'; none which so successfully
      achieved the difficult art of uniting economy with show. I should despair
      of conveying to you an idea of the extent to which Colonel Pompley made
      his income go. It was but seven hundred a year; and many a family
      contrived to do less upon three thousand. To be sure, the Pompleys had no
      children to sponge upon them. What they had they spent all on themselves.
      Neither, if the Pompleys never exceeded their income, did they pretend to
      live much within it. The two ends of the year met at Christmas,&mdash;just
      met, and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Pompley sat at his desk. He was in his well-brushed blue coat,
      buttoned across his breast, his gray trousers fitted tight to his limbs,
      and fastened under his boots with a link chain. He saved a great deal of
      money in straps. No one ever saw Colonel Pompley in dressing-gown and
      slippers. He and his house were alike in order&mdash;always fit to be seen
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "From morn to noon, from noon to dewy eve."
</pre>
    <p>
      The colonel was a short compact man, inclined to be stout,&mdash;with a
      very red face, that seemed not only shaved, but rasped. He wore his hair
      cropped close, except just in front, where it formed what the hairdresser
      called a feather, but it seemed a feather of iron, so stiff and so strong
      was it. Firmness and precision were emphatically marked on the colonel's
      countenance. There was a resolute strain on his features, as if he was
      always employed in making the two ends meet!
    </p>
    <p>
      So he sat before his house-book, with his steel-pen in his hand, and
      making crosses here and notes of interrogation there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. M'Catchley's maid," said the colonel to himself, "must be put upon
      rations. The tea that she drinks! Good heavens!&mdash;tea again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a modest ring at the outer door. "Too early for a visitor!"
      thought the colonel. "Perhaps it is the water-rates."
    </p>
    <p>
      The neat man-servant&mdash;never seen beyond the offices, save in grande
      tenue, plushed and powdered-entered and bowed. "A gentleman, sir, wishes
      to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gentleman," repeated the colonel, glancing towards the clock. "Are you
      sure it is a gentleman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated. "Why, sir, I ben't exactly sure; but he speaks like a
      gentleman. He do say he comes from London to see you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      A long and interesting correspondence was then being held between the
      colonel and one of his wife's trustees touching the investment of Mrs.
      Pompley's fortune. It might be the trustee,&mdash;nay, it must be. The
      trustee had talked of running down to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him come in," said the colonel, "and when I ring&mdash;sandwiches and
      sherry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beef, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ham."
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel put aside his house-book, and wiped his pen. In another minute
      the door opened and the servant announced&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             "MR. DIGBY."
</pre>
    <p>
      The colonel's face fell, and he staggered back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed, and Mr. Digby stood in the middle of the room, leaning on
      the great writing-table for support. The poor soldier looked sicklier and
      shabbier, and nearer the end of all things in life and fortune, than when
      Lord L'Estrange had thrust the pocket-book into his hands. But still the
      servant showed knowledge of the world in calling him gentleman; there was
      no other word to apply to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," began Colonel Pompley, recovering himself, and with great
      solemnity, "I did not expect this pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor visitor stared round him dizzily, and sank into a chair,
      breathing hard. The colonel looked as a man only looks upon a poor
      relation, and buttoned up first one trouser pocket and then the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were in Canada," said the colonel, at last. Mr. Digby had
      now got breath to speak, and he said meekly, "The climate would have
      killed my child, and it is two years since I returned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to have found a very good place in England to make it worth
      your while to leave Canada."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She could not have lived through another winter in Canada,&mdash;the
      doctor said so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh," quoth the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Digby drew a long breath. "I would not come to you, Colonel Pompley,
      while you could think that I came as a beggar for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel's brow relaxed. "A very honourable sentiment, Mr. Digby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: I have gone through a great deal; but you see, Colonel," added the
      poor relation, with a faint smile, "the campaign is well-nigh over, and
      peace is at hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel seemed touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk so, Digby,&mdash;I don't like it. You are younger than I am&mdash;nothing
      more disagreeable than these gloomy views of things. You have got enough
      to live upon, you say,&mdash;at least so I understand you. I am very glad
      to hear it; and, indeed, I could not assist you&mdash;so many claims on
      me. So it is all very well, Digby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Colonel Pompley," cried the soldier, clasping his hands, and with
      feverish energy, "I am a suppliant, not for myself, but my child! I have
      but one,&mdash;only one, a girl. She has been so good to me! She will cost
      you little. Take her when I die; promise her a shelter, a home. I ask no
      more. You are my nearest relative. I have no other to look to. You have no
      children of your own. She will be a blessing to you, as she has been all
      upon earth to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If Colonel Pompley's face was red in ordinary hours, no epithet
      sufficiently rubicund or sanguineous can express its colour at this
      appeal. "The man's mad," he said, at last, with a tone of astonishment
      that almost concealed his wrath,&mdash;"stark mad! I take his child!&mdash;lodge
      and board a great, positive, hungry child! Why, sir, many and many a time
      have I said to Mrs. Pompley, ''T is a mercy we have no children. We could
      never live in this style if we had children,&mdash;never make both ends
      meet.' Child&mdash;the most expensive, ravenous, ruinous thing in the
      world&mdash;a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has been accustomed to starve," said Mr. Digby, plaintively. "Oh,
      Colonel, let me see your wife. Her heart I can touch,&mdash;she is a
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlucky father! A more untoward, unseasonable request the Fates could not
      have put into his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pompley see the Digbies! Mrs. Pompley learn the condition of the
      colonel's grand connections! The colonel would never have been his own man
      again. At the bare idea, he felt as if he could have sunk into the earth
      with shame. In his alarm he made a stride to the door, with the intention
      of locking it. Good heavens, if Mrs. Pompley should come in! And the man,
      too, had been announced by name. Mrs. Pompley might have learned already
      that a Digby was with her husband,&mdash;she might be actually dressing to
      receive him worthily; there was not a moment to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel exploded. "Sir, I wonder at your impudence. See Mrs. Pompley!
      Hush, sir, hush!&mdash;hold your tongue. I have disowned your connection.
      I will not have my wife&mdash;a woman, sir, of the first family&mdash;disgraced
      by it. Yes; you need not fire up. John Pompley is not a man to be bullied
      in his own house. I say disgraced. Did not you run into debt, and spend
      your fortune? Did not you marry a low creature,&mdash;a vulgarian, a
      tradesman's daughter?&mdash;and your poor father such a respectable man,&mdash;a
      benefited clergyman! Did not you sell your commission? Heaven knows what
      became of the money! Did not you turn (I shudder to say it) a common
      stage-player, sir? And then, when you were on your last legs, did I not
      give you L200 out of my own purse to go to Canada? And now here you are
      again,&mdash;and ask me, with a coolness that&mdash;that takes away my
      breath&mdash;takes away-my breath, sir&mdash;to provide for the child you
      have thought proper to have,&mdash;a child whose connections on the
      mother's side are of the most abject and discreditable condition. Leave my
      house, leave it! good heavens, sir, not that way!&mdash;this." And the
      colonel opened the glass-door that led into the garden. "I will let you
      out this way. If Mrs. Pompley should see you!" And with that thought the
      colonel absolutely hooked his arm into his poor relation's, and hurried
      him into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Digby said not a word, but he struggled ineffectually to escape from
      the colonel's arm; and his colour went and came, came and went, with a
      quickness that showed that in those shrunken veins there were still some
      drops of a soldier's blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the colonel had now reached a little postern-door in the garden-wall.
      He opened the latch, and thrust out his poor cousin. Then looking down the
      lane, which was long, straight, and narrow, and seeing it was quite
      solitary, his eye fell upon the forlorn man, and remorse shot through his
      heart. For a moment the hardest of all kinds of avarice, that of the
      genteel, relaxed its gripe. For a moment the most intolerant of all forms
      of pride, that which is based upon false pretences, hushed its voice, and
      the colonel hastily drew out his purse. "There," said he, "that is all I
      can do for you. Do leave the town as quick as you can, and don't mention
      your name to any one. Your father was such a respectable man,&mdash;beneficed
      clergyman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And paid for your commission, Mr. Pompley. My name! I am not ashamed of
      it. But do not fear I shall claim your relationship. No; I am ashamed of
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor cousin put aside the purse, still stretched towards him, with a
      scornful hand, and walked firmly down the lane. Colonel Pompley stood
      irresolute. At that moment a window in his house was thrown open. He heard
      the noise, turned round, and saw his wife looking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Pompley sneaked back through the shrubbery, hiding himself amongst
      the trees.

      "Ill-luck is a betise," said the great Cardinal Richelieu; and in the long
      run, I fear, his Eminence was right. If you could drop Dick Avenel and Mr.
      Digby in the middle of Oxford Street,&mdash;Dick in a fustian jacket,
      Digby in a suit of superfine; Dick with five shillings in his pocket,
      Digby with L1000,&mdash;and if, at the end of ten years, you looked up
      your two men, Dick would be on his road to a fortune, Digby&mdash;what we
      have seen him! Yet Digby had no vice; he did not drink nor gamble. What
      was he, then? Helpless. He had been an only son,&mdash;a spoiled child,
      brought up as "a gentleman;" that is, as a man who was not expected to be
      able to turn his hand to anything. He entered, as we have seen, a very
      expensive regiment, wherein he found himself, at his father's death, with
      L4000 and the incapacity to say "No." Not naturally extravagant, but
      without an idea of the value of money,&mdash;the easiest, gentlest,
      best-tempered man whom example ever led astray. This part of his career
      comprised a very common history,&mdash;the poor man living on equal terms
      with the rich. Debt; recourse to usurers; bills signed sometimes for
      others, renewed at twenty per cent; the L4000 melted like snow; pathetic
      appeal to relations; relations have children of their own; small help
      given grudgingly, eked out by much advice, and coupled with conditions.
      Amongst the conditions there was a very proper and prudent one,&mdash;exchange
      into a less expensive regiment. Exchange effected; peace; obscure country
      quarters; ennui, flute-playing, and idleness. Mr. Digby had no resources
      on a rainy day&mdash;except flute-playing; pretty girl of inferior rank;
      all the officers after her; Digby smitten; pretty girl very virtuous;
      Digby forms honourable intentions; excellent sentiments; imprudent
      marriage. Digby falls in life; colonel's lady will not associate with Mrs.
      Digby; Digby cut by his whole kith and kin; many disagreeable
      circumstances in regimental life; Digby sells out; love in a cottage;
      execution in ditto. Digby had been much applauded as an amateur actor;
      thinks of the stage; genteel comedy,&mdash;a gentlemanlike profession.
      Tries in a provincial town, under another name; unhappily succeeds; life
      of an actor; hand-to-mouth life; illness; chest affected; Digby's voice
      becomes hoarse and feeble; not aware of it; attributes failing success to
      ignorant provincial public; appears in London; is hissed; returns to the
      provinces; sinks into very small parts; prison; despair; wife dies; appeal
      again to relations; a subscription made to get rid of him; send him out of
      the country; place in Canada,&mdash;superintendent to an estate, L150 a
      year; pursued by ill-luck; never before fit for business, not fit now;
      honest as the day, but keeps slovenly accounts; child cannot bear the
      winter of Canada; Digby wrapped up in the child; return home; mysterious
      life for two years; child patient, thoughtful, loving; has learned to
      work; manages for father; often supports him; constitution rapidly
      breaking; thought of what will become of his child,&mdash;worst disease of
      all. Poor Digby! never did a base, cruel, unkind thing in his life; and
      here he is, walking down the lane from Colonel Pompley's house! Now, if
      Digby had but learned a little of the world's cunning, I think he would
      have succeeded even with Colonel Pompley. Had he spent the L100 received
      from Lord L'Estrange with a view to effect; had he bestowed a fitting
      wardrobe on himself and his pretty Helen; had he stopped at the last
      stage, taken thence a smart chaise and pair, and presented himself at
      Colonel Pompley's in a way that would not have discredited the colonel's
      connection, and then, instead of praying for home and shelter, asked the
      colonel to become guardian to his child in case of his death, I have a
      strong notion that the colonel, in spite of his avarice, would have
      stretched both ends so as to take in Helen Digby. But our poor friend had
      no such arts. Indeed, of the L100 he had already very little left, for
      before leaving town he had committed what Sheridan considered the extreme
      of extravagance,&mdash;frittered away his money in paying his debts; and
      as for dressing up Helen and himself&mdash;if that thought had ever
      occurred to him, he would have rejected it as foolish. He would have
      thought that the more he showed his poverty, the more he would be pitied,&mdash;the
      worst mistake a poor cousin can commit. According to Theophrastus, the
      partridge of Paphlagonia has two hearts: so have most men; it is the
      common mistake of the unlucky to knock at the wrong one.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Digby entered the room of the inn in which he had left Helen. She was
      seated by the window, and looking out wistfully on the narrow street,
      perhaps at the children at play. There had never been a playtime for Helen
      Digby.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang forward as her father came in. His coming was her holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must go back to London," said Mr. Digby, sinking helplessly on the
      chair. Then with his sort of sickly smile,&mdash;for he was bland even to
      his child,&mdash;"Will you kindly inquire when the first coach leaves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the active cares of their careful life devolved upon that quiet child.
      She kissed her father, placed before him a cough mixture which he had
      brought from London, and went out silently to make the necessary
      inquiries, and prepare for the journey back.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock the father and child were seated in the night-coach, with
      one other passenger,&mdash;a man muffled up to the chin. After the first
      mile the man let down one of the windows. Though it was summer the air was
      chill and raw. Digby shivered and coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen placed her hand on the window, and, leaning towards the passenger,
      whispered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh!" said the passenger, "draw up the window? You have got your own
      window; this is mine. Oxygen, young lady," he added solemnly, "oxygen is
      the breath of life. Cott, child!" he continued with suppressed choler, and
      a Welsh pronunciation, "Cott! let us breathe and live."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was frightened, and recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father, who had not heard, or had not heeded, this colloquy, retreated
      into the corner, put up the collar of his coat, and coughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is cold, my dear," said he, languidly, to Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passenger caught the word, and replied indignantly, but as if
      soliloquizing,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cold-ugh! I do believe the English are the stuffiest people! Look at
      their four-post beds&mdash;all the curtains drawn, shutters closed, board
      before the chimney&mdash;not a house with a ventilator! Cold-ugh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The window next Mr. Digby did not fit well into its frame. "There is a sad
      draught," said the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen instantly occupied herself in stopping up the chinks of the window
      with her handkerchief. Mr. Digby glanced ruefully at the other window. The
      look, which was very eloquent, aroused yet more the traveller's spleen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleasant!" said he. "Cott! I suppose you will ask me to go outside next!
      But people who travel in a coach should know the law of a coach. I don't
      interfere with your window; you have no business to interfere with mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I did not speak," said Mr. Digby, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Miss here did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir!" said Helen, plaintively, "if you knew how Papa suffers!" And
      her hand again moved towards the obnoxious window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear; the gentleman is in his right," said Mr. Digby; and, bowing
      with his wonted suavity, he added, "Excuse her, sir. She thinks a great
      deal too much of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The passenger said nothing, and Helen nestled closer to her father, and
      strove to screen him from the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passenger moved uneasily. "Well," said he, with a sort of snort, "air
      is air, and right is right: but here goes&mdash;" and he hastily drew up
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen turned her face full towards the passenger with a grateful
      expression, visible even in the dim light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind, sir," said poor Mr. Digby; "I am ashamed to&mdash;"
      his cough choked the rest of the sentence. The passenger, who was a
      plethoric, sanguineous man, felt as if he were stifling. But he took off
      his wrappers, and resigned the oxygen like a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he drew nearer to the sufferer, and laid hand on his wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are feverish, I fear. I am a medical man. St!&mdash;one&mdash;two.
      Cott! you should not travel; you are not fit for it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Digby shook his head; he was too feeble to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passenger thrust his hand into his coat-pocket, and drew out what
      seemed a cigar-case, but what, in fact, was a leathern repertory,
      containing a variety of minute phials.
    </p>
    <p>
      From one of these phials he extracted two tiny globules. "There," said he,
      "open your mouth, put those on the tip of your tongue. They will lower the
      pulse, check the fever. Be better presently, but should not travel, want
      rest; you should be in bed. Aconite! Henbane! hum! Your papa is of fair
      complexion,&mdash;a timid character, I should say;&mdash;a horror of work,
      perhaps. Eh, child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" faltered Helen, astonished and alarmed. Was the man a conjuror?
    </p>
    <p>
      "A case for phosphor!" cried the passenger: "that fool Browne would have
      said arsenic. Don't be persuaded to take arsenic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arsenic, sir!" echoed the mild Digby. "No: however unfortunate a man may
      be, I think, sir, that suicide is&mdash;tempting, perhaps, but highly
      criminal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suicide," said the passenger, tranquilly,&mdash;"suicide is my hobby! You
      have no symptom of that kind, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens! No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If ever you feel violently impelled to drown yourself, take pulsatilla;
      but if you feel a preference towards blowing out your brains, accompanied
      with weight in the limbs, loss of appetite, dry cough, and bad corns,
      sulphuret of antimony. Don't forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though poor Mr. Digby confusedly thought that the gentleman was out of his
      mind, yet he tried politely to say "that he was much obliged, and would be
      sure to remember;" but his tongue failed him, and his own ideas grew
      perplexed. His head fell back heavily, and he sank into a silence which
      seemed that of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller looked hard at Helen, as she gently drew her father's head
      on her shoulder, and there pillowed it with a tenderness which was more
      that of a mother than child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moral affections, soft, compassionate!&mdash;a good child and would go
      well with&mdash;pulsatilla."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen held up her finger, and glanced from her father to the traveller,
      and then to her father again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly,&mdash;pulsatilla!" muttered the homoeopathist, and ensconcing
      himself in his own corner, he also sought to sleep. But after vain
      efforts, accompanied by restless gestures and movements, he suddenly
      started up, and again extracted his phial-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce are they to me?" he muttered. "Morbid sensibility of
      character&mdash;coffee? No!&mdash;accompanied by vivacity and violence&mdash;nux!"
      He brought his book to the window, contrived to read the label on a pigmy
      bottle. "Nux! that's it," he said,&mdash;and he swallowed a globule!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," quoth he, after a pause, "I don't care a straw for the misfortunes
      of other people; nay, I have half a mind to let down the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'll not," he added resolutely; and this time he fell fairly asleep.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The coach stopped at eleven o'clock to allow the passengers to sup. The
      homoeopathist woke up, got out, gave himself a shake, and inhaled the
      fresh air into his vigorous lungs with an evident sensation of delight. He
      then turned and looked into the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let your father get out, my dear," said he, with a tone more gentle than
      usual. "I should like to see him indoors,&mdash;perhaps I can do him
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was Helen's terror when she found that her father did not stir!
      He was in a deep swoon, and still quite insensible when they lifted him
      from the carriage. When he recovered his senses his cough returned, and
      the effort brought up blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible for him to proceed farther. The homoeopathist assisted
      to undress and put him into bed. And having administered another of his
      mysterious globules, he inquired of the landlady how far it was to the
      nearest doctor,&mdash;for the inn stood by itself in a small hamlet. There
      was the parish apothecary three miles off. But on hearing that the
      gentlefolks employed Dr. Dosewell, and it was a good seven miles to his
      house, the homoeopathist fetched a deep breath. The coach only stopped a
      quarter of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cott!" said he, angrily, to himself, "the nux was a failure. My
      sensibility is chronic. I must go through a long course to get rid of it.
      Hollo, guard! get out my carpet-bag. I sha'n't go on to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the good man after a very slight supper went upstairs again to the
      sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I send for Dr. Dosewell, sir?" asked the landlady, stopping him at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum! At what hour to-morrow does the next coach to London pass?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not before eight, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, send for the doctor to be here at seven. That leaves us at least
      some hours free from allopathy and murder," grunted the disciple of
      Hahnemann, as he entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it was the globule that the homoeopathist had administered, or the
      effect of nature, aided by repose, that checked the effusion of blood, and
      restored some temporary strength to the poor sufferer, is more than it
      becomes one not of the Faculty to opine. But certainly Mr. Digby seemed
      better, and he gradually fell into a profound sleep, but not till the
      doctor had put his ear to his chest, tapped it with his hand, and asked
      several questions; after which the homoeopathist retired into a corner of
      the room, and leaning his face on his hand seemed to meditate. From his
      thoughts he was disturbed by a gentle touch. Helen was kneeling at his
      feet. "Is he very ill, very?" said she; and her fond wistful eyes were
      fixed on the physician's with all the earnestness of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father is very ill," replied the doctor, after a short pause. "He
      cannot move hence for some days at least. I am going to London; shall I
      call on your relations, and tell some of them to join you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, sir," answered Helen, colouring. "But do not fear; I can
      nurse Papa. I think he has been worse before,&mdash;that is, he has
      complained more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The homeopathist rose, and took two strides across the room; then he
      paused by the bed, and listened to the breathing of the sleeping man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole back to the child, who was still kneeling, took her in his arms
      and kissed her. "Tamn it," said he, angrily, and putting her down, "go to
      bed now,&mdash;you are not wanted any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir," said Helen, "I cannot leave him so. If he wakes he would
      miss me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's hand trembled; he had recourse to his globules.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anxiety&mdash;grief suppressed," muttered he. "Don't you want to cry, my
      dear? Cry,&mdash;do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," murmured Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pulsatilla!" said the doctor, almost with triumph. "I said so from the
      first. Open your mouth&mdash;here! Goodnight. My room is opposite,&mdash;No.
      6; call me if he wakes."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At seven o'clock Dr. Dosewell arrived, and was shown into the room of the
      homoeopathist, who, already up and dressed, had visited his patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Morgan," said the homoeopathist; "I am a physician. I leave in
      your hands a patient whom, I fear, neither I nor you can restore. Come and
      look at him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two doctors went into the sick-room. Mr. Digby was very feeble, but he
      had recovered his consciousness, and inclined his head courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to cause so much trouble," said he. The homoeopathist drew
      away Helen; the allopathist seated himself by the bedside and put his
      questions, felt the pulse, sounded the lungs, and looked at the tongue of
      the patient. Helen's eye was fixed on the strange doctor, and her colour
      rose, and her eye sparkled when he got up cheerfully, and said in a
      pleasant voice, "You may have a little tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea!" growled the homeopathist,&mdash;"barbarian!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is better, then, sir?" said Helen, creeping to the allopathist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, my dear,&mdash;certainly; and we shall do very well, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two doctors then withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last about a week!" said Dr. Dosewell, smiling pleasantly, and showing a
      very white set of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have said a month; but our systems are different," replied Dr.
      Morgan, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (courteously).&mdash;"We country doctors bow to our
      metropolitan superiors; what would you advise? You would venture, perhaps,
      the experiment of bleeding."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN (spluttering and growling Welsh, which he never did but in
      excitement).&mdash;"Pleed! Cott in heaven! do you think I am a putcher,&mdash;an
      executioner? Pleed! Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL.&mdash;"I don't find it answer, myself, when both lungs are
      gone! But perhaps you are for inhaling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"Fiddledee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (with some displeasure).&mdash;"What would you advise, then,
      in order to prolong our patient's life for a month?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"Give him Rhus!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL.&mdash;"Rhus, sir! Rhus! I don't know that medicine. Rhus!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. MORGAN.&mdash;"Rhus Toxicodendron."
    </p>
    <p>
      The length of the last word excited Dr. Dosewell's respect. A word of five
      syllables,&mdash;that was something like! He bowed deferentially, but
      still looked puzzled. At last he said, smiling frankly, "You great London
      practitioners have so many new medicines: may I ask what Rhus toxico&mdash;toxico&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dendron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The juice of the upas,&mdash;vulgarly called the poison-tree." Dr.
      Dosewell started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upas&mdash;poison-tree&mdash;little birds that come under the shade fall
      down dead! You give upas juice in these desperate cases: what's the dose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morgan grinned maliciously, and produced a globule the size of a small
      pin's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Dosewell recoiled in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said he, very coldly, and assuming at once an air of superb
      superiority, "I see, a homoeopathist, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A homoeopathist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um!"

    <p>
      "A strange system, Dr. Morgan," said Dr. Dosewell, recovering his cheerful
      smile, but with a curl of contempt in it, "and would soon do for the
      druggists."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serve 'em right. The druggists soon do for the patients."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (with dignity).&mdash;"You don't know, perhaps, Dr. Morgan,
      that I am an apothecary as well as a surgeon. In fact," he added, with a
      certain grand humility, "I have not yet taken a diploma, and am but doctor
      by courtesy."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"All one, sir! Doctor signs the death-warrant,
      'pothecary does the deed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (with a withering sneer).&mdash;"Certainly we don't profess
      to keep a dying man alive upon the juice of the deadly upas-tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN (complacently).&mdash;"Of course you don't. There are no
      poisons with us. That's just the difference between you and me, Dr.
      Dosewell."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (pointing to the homeopathist's travelling pharmacopoeia, and
      with affected candour).&mdash;"Indeed, I have always said that if you can
      do no good, you can do no harm, with your infinitesimals."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN, who had been obtuse to the insinuation of poisoning, fires up
      violently at the charge of doing no harm. "You know nothing about it! I
      could kill quite as many people as you, if I chose it; but I don't
      choose."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (shrugging his shoulders).&mdash;"Sir Sir! It is no use
      arguing; the thing's against common-sense. In short, it is my firm belief
      that it is&mdash;is a complete&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"A complete what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (provoked to the utmost).&mdash;"Humbug!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"Humbug! Cott in heaven! You old&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL.&mdash;"Old what, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN (at home in a series of alliteral vowels, which none but a
      Cymbrian could have uttered without gasping).&mdash;"Old allopathical
      anthropophagite!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (starting up, seizing by the back the chair on which he had
      sat, and bringing it down violently on its four legs).&mdash;"Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN (imitating the action with his own chair).&mdash;"Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL.&mdash;"You're abusive."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"You're impertinent."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL.&mdash;"Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two rivals confronted each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both athletic men, and fiery men. Dr. Dosewell was the taller,
      but Dr. Morgan was the stouter. Dr. Dosewell on the mother's side was
      Irish; but Dr. Morgan on both sides was Welsh. All things considered, I
      would have backed Dr. Morgan if it had come to blows. But, luckily for the
      honour of science, here the chambermaid knocked at the door, and said,
      "The coach is coming, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morgan recovered his temper and his manners at that announcement. "Dr.
      Dosewell," said he, "I have been too hot,&mdash;I apologize."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Morgan," answered the allopathist, "I forgot myself. Your hand, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"We are both devoted to humanity, though with different
      opinions. We should respect each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL.&mdash;"Where look for liberality, if men of science are
      illiberal to their brethren?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN (aside).&mdash;"The old hypocrite! He would pound me in a
      mortar if the law would let him."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (aside).&mdash;"The wretched charlatan! I should like to
      pound him in a mortar."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"Good-by, my esteemed and worthy brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL.&mdash;"My excellent friend, good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN (returning in haste).&mdash;"I forgot. I don't think our poor
      patient is very rich. I confide him to your disinterested benevolence."
      (Hurries away.)
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. DOSEWELL (in a rage).&mdash;"Seven miles at six o'clock in the
      morning, and perhaps done out of my fee! Quack! Villain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Dr. Morgan had returned to the sick-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must wish you farewell," said he to poor Mr. Digby, who was languidly
      sipping his tea. "But you are in the hands of a&mdash;of a&mdash;gentleman
      in the profession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been too kind,&mdash;I am shocked," said Mr. Digby. "Helen,
      where's my purse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morgan paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, first, because it must be owned that his practice was
      restricted, and a fee gratified the vanity natural to unappreciated
      talent, and had the charm of novelty, which is sweet to human nature
      itself. Secondly, he was a man&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Who knew his rights; and, knowing, dared maintain."
</pre>
    <p>
      He had resigned a coach fare, stayed a night, and thought he had relieved
      his patient. He had a right to his fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, he paused, because, though he had small practice, he
      was tolerably well off, and did not care for money in itself, and he
      suspected his patient to be no Croesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the purse was in Helen's hand. He took it from her, and saw but
      a few sovereigns within the well-worn network. He drew the child a little
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer me, my dear, frankly,&mdash;is your papa rich?&mdash;" And he
      glanced at the shabby clothes strewed on the chair and Helen's faded
      frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, no!" said Helen, hanging her head. "Is that all you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ashamed to offer you two guineas," said Mr. Digby's hollow voice
      from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I should be still more ashamed to take them. Good by, sir. Come here,
      my child. Keep your money, and don't waste it on the other doctor more
      than you can help. His medicines can do your father no good. But I suppose
      you must have some. He's no physician, therefore there's no fee. He'll
      send a bill,&mdash;it can't be much. You understand. And now, God bless
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morgan was off. But, as he paid the landlady his bill, he said
      considerately, "The poor people upstairs can pay you, but not that doctor,&mdash;and
      he's of no use. Be kind to the little girl, and get the doctor to tell his
      patient (quietly of course) to write to his friends&mdash;soon&mdash;you
      understand. Somebody must take charge of the poor child. And stop&mdash;hold
      your hand; take care&mdash;these globules for the little girl when her
      father dies,"&mdash;here the doctor muttered to himself, "grief,&mdash;aconite,
      and if she cries too much afterwards, these&mdash;(don't mistake). Tears,&mdash;caustic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, sir," cried the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coming; tears,&mdash;caustic," repeated the homoeopathist, pulling out
      his handkerchief and his phial-book together as he got into the coach; and
      he hastily swallowed his antilachrymal.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Richard Avenel was in a state of great nervous excitement. He proposed to
      give an entertainment of a kind wholly new to the experience of
      Screwstown. Mrs. M'Catchley had described with much eloquence the Dejeunes
      dansants of her fashionable friends residing in the elegant suburbs of
      Wimbledon and Fulham. She declared that nothing was so agreeable. She had
      even said point-blank to Mr. Avenel, "Why don't you give a Dejeune
      dansant?" And, therewith, a Dejeune dansant Mr. Avenel resolved to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was fixed, and Mr. Avenel entered into all the requisite
      preparations, with the energy of a man and the providence of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning as he stood musing on the lawn, irresolute as to the best site
      for the tents, Leonard came up to him with an open letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear uncle," said he, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Mr. Avenel, with a start. "Ha-well, what now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just received a letter from Mr. Dale. He tells me that my poor
      mother is very restless and uneasy, because he cannot assure her that he
      has heard from me; and his letter requires an answer. Indeed I shall seem
      very ungrateful to him&mdash;to all&mdash;if I do not write."
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Avenel's brows met. He uttered an impatient "Pish!" and turned
      away. Then coming back, he fixed his clear hawk-like eye on Leonard's
      ingenuous countenance, linked his arm into his nephew's, and drew him into
      the shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Leonard," said he, after a pause, "it is time that I should give
      you some idea of my plans with regard to you. You have seen my manner of
      living&mdash;some difference from what you ever saw before, I calculate!
      Now I have given you, what no one gave me, a lift in the world; and where
      I place you, there you must help yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such is my duty and my desire," said Leonard, heartily. "Good. You are a
      clever lad, and a genteel lad, and will do me credit. I have had doubts of
      what is best for you. At one time I thought of sending you to college.
      That, I know; is Mr. Dale's wish; perhaps it is your own. But I have given
      up that idea; I have something better for you. You have a clear head for
      business, and are a capital arithmetician. I think of bringing you up to
      superintend my business; by and by I will admit you into partnership; and
      before you are thirty you will be a rich man. Come, does that suit you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear uncle," said Leonard, frankly, but much touched by this
      generosity, "it is not for me to have a choice. I should have preferred
      going to college, because there I might gain independence for myself and
      cease to be a burden on you. Moreover, my heart moves me to studies more
      congenial with the college than the counting-house. But all this is
      nothing compared with my wish to be of use to you, and to prove in any
      way, however feebly, my gratitude for all your kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a good, grateful, sensible lad," exclaimed Richard, heartily; "and
      believe me, though I'm a rough diamond, I have your true interest at
      heart. You can be of use to me, and in being so you will best serve
      yourself. To tell you the truth, I have some idea of changing my
      condition. There's a lady of fashion and quality who, I think, may
      condescend to become Mrs. Avenel; and if so, I shall probably reside a
      great part of the year in London. I don't want to give up my business. No
      other investment will yield the same interest. But you can soon learn to
      superintend it for me, as some day or other I may retire, and then you can
      step in. Once a member of our great commercial class, and with your
      talents you may be anything,&mdash;member of parliament, and after that,
      minister of State, for what I know. And my wife&mdash;hem! that is to be&mdash;has
      great connections, and you shall marry well; and&mdash;oh, the Avenels
      will hold their heads with the highest, after all! Damn the aristocracy!
      we clever fellows will be the aristocrats, eh?" Richard rubbed his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, as we have seen, Leonard, especially in his earlier steps to
      knowledge, had repined at his position in the many degrees of life;
      certainly he was still ambitious; certainly he could not now have returned
      contentedly to the humble occupation he had left; and woe to the young man
      who does not hear with a quickened pulse and brightening eye words that
      promise independence, and flatter with the hope of distinction. Still, it
      was with all the reaction of chill and mournful disappointment that
      Leonard, a few hours after this dialogue with his uncle, found himself
      alone in the fields, and pondering over the prospects before him. He had
      set his heart upon completing his intellectual education, upon developing
      those powers within him which yearned for an arena of literature, and
      revolted from the routine of trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to his credit be it said, that he vigorously resisted this natural
      disappointment, and by degrees schooled himself to look cheerfully on the
      path imposed on his duty, and sanctioned by the manly sense that was at
      the core of his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that this self-conquest showed that the boy had true genius. The
      false genius would have written sonnets and despaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, Richard Avenel left his nephew sadly perplexed as to the knotty
      question from which their talk on the future had diverged,&mdash;namely,
      should he write to the parson, and assure the fears of his mother? How do
      so without Richard's consent, when Richard had on a former occasion so
      imperiously declared that, if he did, it would lose his mother all that
      Richard intended to settle on her? While he was debating this matter with
      his conscience, leaning against a stile that interrupted a path to the
      town, Leonard Fairfield was startled by an exclamation. He looked up, and
      beheld Mr. Sprott the tinker.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The tinker, blacker and grimmer than ever, stared hard at the altered
      person of his old acquaintance, and extended his sable fingers, as if
      inclined to convince himself by the sense of touch that it was Leonard in
      the flesh that he beheld, under vestments so marvellously elegant and
      preternaturally spruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard shrank mechanically from the contact, while in great surprise he
      faltered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You here, Mr. Sprott! What could bring you so far from home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ome!" echoed the tinker, "I 'as no 'ome! or rather, d' ye see, Muster
      Fairfilt, I makes myself at 'ome verever I goes! Lor' love ye! I ben't
      settled on no parridge. I wanders here and I vanders there, and that's my
      'ome verever I can mend my kettles and sell my tracks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the tinker slid his panniers on the ground, gave a grunt of
      release and satisfaction, and seated himself with great composure on the
      stile from which Leonard had retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, dash my wig," resumed Mr. Sprott, as he once more surveyed Leonard,
      "vy, you bees a rale gentleman, now, surely! Vot's the dodge, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dodge!" repeated Leonard, mechanically, "I don't understand you." Then,
      thinking that it was neither necessary nor expedient to keep up his
      acquaintance with Mr. Sprott, nor prudent to expose himself to the battery
      of questions which he foresaw that further parley would bring upon him, he
      extended a crown-piece to the tinker; and saying, with a half-smile, "You
      must excuse me for leaving you&mdash;I have business in the town; and do
      me the favour to accept this trifle," he walked briskly off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinker looked long at the crown-piece, and then sliding it into his
      pocket, said to himself,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, 'ush-money! No go, my swell cove."
    </p>
    <p>
      After venting that brief soliloquy he sat silent a little while, till
      Leonard was nearly out of sight; then rose, resumed his fardel, and
      creeping quick along the hedgerows, followed Leonard towards the town.
      Just in the last field, as he looked over the hedge, he saw Leonard
      accosted by a gentleman of comely mien and important swagger. That
      gentleman soon left the young man, and came, whistling loud, up the path,
      and straight towards the tinker. Mr. Sprott looked round, but the hedge
      was too neat to allow of a good hiding-place, so he put a bold front on
      it, and stepped forth like a man. But, alas for him! before he got into
      the public path, the proprietor of the land, Mr. Richard Avenel (for the
      gentleman was no less a personage), had spied out the trespasser, and
      called to him with a "Hillo, fellow," that bespoke all the dignity of a
      man who owns acres, and all the wrath of a man who beholds those acres
      impudently invaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tinker stopped, and Mr. Avenel stalked up to him. "What the devil are
      you doing on my property, lurking by my hedge? I suspect you are an
      incendiary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I be a tinker," quoth Mr. Sprott, not louting low, for a sturdy
      republican was Mr. Sprott, but, like a lord of human kind,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "Pride in his port, defiance in his eye."
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Avenel's fingers itched to knock the tinker's villanous hat off his
      jacobinical head, but he repressed the undignified impulse by thrusting
      both hands deep into his trousers' pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A tinker!" he cried,&mdash;"that's a vagrant; and I'm a magistrate, and
      I've a great mind to send you to the treadmill,&mdash;that I have. What do
      you do here, I say? You have not answered my question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does I do 'ere?" said Mr. Sprott. "Vy, you had better ax my crakter
      of the young gent I saw you talking with just now; he knows me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! my nephew knows you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "W-hew," whistled the tinker, "your nephew is it, sir? I have a great
      respek for your family. I 've knowed Mrs. Fairfilt the vashervoman this
      many a year. I 'umbly ax your pardon." And he took off his hat this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Avenel turned red and white in a breath. He growled out something
      inaudible, turned on his heel, and strode off. The tinker watched him as
      he had watched Leonard, and then dogged the uncle as he had dogged the
      nephew. I don't presume to say that there was cause and effect in what
      happened that night, but it was what is called "a curious coincidence"
      that that night one of Richard Avenel's ricks was set on fire, and that
      that day he had called Mr. Sprott an incendiary. Mr. Sprott was a man of a
      very high spirit, and did not forgive an insult easily. His nature was
      inflammatory, and so was that of the lucifers which he always carried
      about him, with his tracts and glue-pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning there was an inquiry made for the tinker, but he had
      disappeared from the neighbourhood.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a fortunate thing that the dejeune dansant so absorbed Mr. Richard
      Avenel's thoughts that even the conflagration of his rick could not scare
      away the graceful and poetic images connected with that pastoral
      festivity. He was even loose and careless in the questions he put to
      Leonard about the tinker; nor did he send justice in pursuit of that
      itinerant trader; for, to say truth, Richard Avenel was a man accustomed
      to make enemies amongst the lower orders; and though he suspected Mr.
      Sprott of destroying his rick, yet, when he once set about suspecting, he
      found he had quite as good cause to suspect fifty other persons. How on
      earth could a man puzzle himself about ricks and tinkers when all his
      cares and energies were devoted to a dejeune dansant? It was a maxim of
      Richard Avenel's, as it ought to be of every clever man, "to do one thing
      at a time;" and therefore he postponed all other considerations till the
      dejeune dansant was fairly done with. Amongst these considerations was the
      letter which Leonard wished to write to the parson. "Wait a bit, and we
      will both write!" said Richard, good-humouredly, "the moment the dijeune
      dansant is over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be owned that this fete was no ordinary provincial ceremonial.
      Richard Avenel was a man to do a thing well when he set about it,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "He soused the cabbage with a bounteous heart."
</pre>
    <p>
      By little and little his first notions had expanded, till what had been
      meant to be only neat and elegant now embraced the costly and magnificent.
      Artificers accustomed to dejeunes dansants came all the way from London to
      assist, to direct, to create. Hungarian singers and Tyrolese singers and
      Swiss peasant-women, who were to chant the Ranz des Vaches, and milk cows
      or make syllabubs, were engaged. The great marquee was decorated as a
      Gothic banquet-hall; the breakfast itself was to consist of "all the
      delicacies of the season." In short, as Richard Avenel said to himself,
      "It is a thing once in a way; a thing on which I don't object to spend
      money, provided that the thing is&mdash;the thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a matter of grave meditation how to make the society worthy of
      the revel; for Richard Avenel was not contented with the mere aristocracy
      of the town,&mdash;his ambition had grown with his expenses. "Since it
      will cost so much," said he, "I may as well come it strong, and get in the
      county."
    </p>
    <p>
      True, that he was personally acquainted with very few of what are called
      county families. But still, when a man makes himself a mark in a large
      town, and can return one of the members whom that town sends to
      parliament; and when, moreover, that man proposes to give some superb and
      original entertainment, in which the old can eat and the young can dance,
      there is no county in the island that has not families enow who will be
      delighted by an invitation from THAT MAN. And so Richard, finding that, as
      the thing got talked of, the dean's lady, and Mrs. Pompley, and various
      other great personages, took the liberty to suggest that Squire this, and
      Sir somebody that, would be so pleased if they were asked, fairly took the
      bull by the horns, and sent out his cards to Park, Hall, and Rectory,
      within a circumference of twelve miles. He met with but few refusals, and
      he now counted upon five hundred guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In for a penny in for a pound," said Mr. Richard Avenel. "I wonder what
      Mrs. M'Catchley will say?" Indeed, if the whole truth must be known,&mdash;Mr.
      Richard Avenel not only gave that dejeune dansant in honour of Mrs.
      M'Catchley, but he had fixed in his heart of hearts upon that occasion
      (when surrounded by all his splendour, and assisted by the seductive arts
      of Terpsichore and Bacchus) to whisper to Mrs. M'Catchley those soft words
      which&mdash;but why not here let Mr. Richard Avenel use his own idiomatic
      and unsophisticated expression? "Please the pigs, then," said Mr. Avenel
      to himself, "I shall pop the question!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Great Day arrived at last; and Mr. Richard Avenel, from his
      dressing-room window, looked on the scene below as Hannibal or Napoleon
      looked from the Alps on Italy. It was a scene to gratify the thought of
      conquest, and reward the labours of ambition. Placed on a little eminence
      stood the singers from the mountains of the Tyrol, their high-crowned hats
      and filigree buttons and gay sashes gleaming in the sun. Just seen from
      his place of watch, though concealed from the casual eye, the Hungarian
      musicians lay in ambush amidst a little belt of laurels and American
      shrubs. Far to the right lay what had once been called horresco referens
      the duckpond, where&mdash;"Dulce sonant tenui gutture carmen aves." But
      the ruthless ingenuity of the head-artificer had converted the duck-pond
      into a Swiss lake, despite grievous wrong and sorrow to the assuetum
      innocuumque genus,&mdash;the familiar and harmless inhabitants, who had
      been all expatriated and banished from their native waves. Large poles
      twisted with fir branches, stuck thickly around the lake, gave to the
      waters the becoming Helvetian gloom. And here, beside three cows all
      bedecked with ribbons, stood the Swiss maidens destined to startle the
      shades with the Ranz des Vaches. To the left, full upon the sward, which
      it almost entirely covered, stretched the great Gothic marquee, divided
      into two grand sections,&mdash;one for the dancing, one for the dejeune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was propitious,&mdash;not a cloud in the sky. The musicians were
      already tuning their instruments; figures of waiters hired of Gunter&mdash;trim
      and decorous, in black trousers and white waistcoats&mdash;passed to and
      fro the space between the house and marquee. Richard looked and looked;
      and as he looked he drew mechanically his razor across the strop; and when
      he had looked his fill, he turned reluctantly to the glass and shaved! All
      that blessed morning he had been too busy, till then, to think of shaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a vast deal of character in the way that a man performs that
      operation of shaving! You should have seen Richard Avenel shave! You could
      have judged at once how he would shave his neighbours, when you saw the
      celerity, the completeness with which he shaved himself,&mdash;a
      forestroke and a backstroke, and tondenti barba cadebat. Cheek and chin
      were as smooth as glass. You would have buttoned up your pockets
      instinctively if you had seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rest of Mr. Avenel's toilet was not completed with correspondent
      despatch. On his bed, and on his chairs, and on his sofa, and on his
      drawers, lay trousers and vests and cravats enough to distract the choice
      of a Stoic. And first one pair of trousers was tried on, and then another&mdash;and
      one waistcoat, and then a second, and then a third. Gradually that
      chef-d'oeuvre of civilization&mdash;a man dressed&mdash;grew into
      development and form; and, finally, Mr. Richard Avenel emerged into the
      light of day. He had been lucky in his costume,&mdash;he felt it. It might
      not suit every one in colour or cut, but it suited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was his garb. On such occasion, what epic poet would not describe
      the robe and tunic of a hero?
    </p>
    <p>
      His surtout&mdash;in modern phrase his frockcoat&mdash;was blue, a rich
      blue, a blue that the royal brothers of George the Fourth were wont to
      favour. And the surtout, single-breasted, was thrown open gallantly; and
      in the second button-hole thereof was a moss-rose. The vest was white, and
      the trousers a pearl gray, with what tailors style "a handsome fall over
      the boot." A blue and white silk cravat, tied loose and debonair; an ample
      field of shirt front, with plain gold studs; a pair of lemon-coloured kid
      gloves, and a white hat, placed somewhat too knowingly on one side,
      complete the description, and "give the world assurance of the man." And,
      with his light, firm, well-shaped figure, his clear complexion, his keen,
      bright eye, and features that bespoke the courage, precision, and
      alertness of his character,&mdash;that is to say, features bold, not
      large, well-defined, and regular,&mdash;you might walk long through town
      or country before you would see a handsomer specimen of humanity than our
      friend Richard Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Handsome, and feeling that he was handsome; rich, and feeling that he was
      rich; lord of the fete, and feeling that he was lord of the fete, Richard
      Avenel stepped out upon his lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the dust began to rise along the road, and carriages and gigs and
      chaises and flies might be seen at near intervals and in quick procession.
      People came pretty much about the same time-as they do in the country&mdash;Heaven
      reward them for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Avenel was not quite at his ease at first in receiving his guests,
      especially those whom he did not know by sight. But when the dancing
      began, and he had secured the fair hand of Mrs. M'Catchley for the
      initiary quadrille, his courage and presence of mind returned to him; and,
      seeing that many people whom he had not received at all seemed to enjoy
      themselves very much, he gave up the attempt to receive those who came
      after,&mdash;and that was a great relief to all parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Leonard looked on the animated scene with a silent melancholy,
      which he in vain endeavoured to shake off,&mdash;a melancholy more common
      amongst very young men in such scenes than we are apt to suppose. Somehow
      or other, the pleasure was not congenial to him; he had no Mrs. M'Catchley
      to endear it; he knew very few people, he was shy, he felt his position
      with his uncle was equivocal, he had not the habit of society, he heard,
      incidentally, many an ill-natured remark upon his uncle and the
      entertainment, he felt indignant and mortified. He had been a great deal
      happier eating his radishes and reading his book by the little fountain in
      Riccabocca's garden. He retired to a quiet part of the grounds, seated
      himself under a tree, leaned his cheek on his hand, and mused. He was soon
      far away;&mdash;happy age, when, whatever the present, the future seems so
      fair and so infinite!
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the dejeune had succeeded the earlier dances; and, as champagne
      flowed royally, it is astonishing how the entertainment brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was beginning to slope towards the west, when, during a temporary
      cessation of the dance, all the guests had assembled in such space as the
      tent left on the lawn, or thickly filled the walks immediately adjoining
      it. The gay dresses of the ladies, the joyous laughter heard everywhere,
      and the brilliant sunlight over all, conveyed even to Leonard the notion,
      not of mere hypocritical pleasure, but actual healthful happiness. He was
      attracted from his revery, and timidly mingled with the groups. But
      Richard Avenel, with the fair Mrs. M'Catchley&mdash;her complexion more
      vivid, and her eyes more dazzling, and her step more elastic than usual&mdash;had
      turned from the gayety just as Leonard had turned towards it, and was now
      on the very spot (remote, obscure, shaded by the few trees above five
      years old that Mr. Avenel's property boasted) which the young dreamer had
      deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then! Ah, then! moment so meet for the sweet question of questions,
      place so appropriate for the delicate, bashful, murmured popping thereof!&mdash;suddenly
      from the sward before, from the groups beyond, there floated to the ears
      of Richard Avenel an indescribable, mingled, ominous sound,&mdash;a sound
      as of a general titter, a horrid, malignant, but low cachinnation. And
      Mrs. M'Catchley, stretching forth her parasol, exclaimed, "Dear me, Mr.
      Avenel, what can they be all crowding there for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain sounds and certain sights&mdash;the one indistinct, the
      other vaguely conjecturable&mdash;which, nevertheless, we know, by an
      instinct, bode some diabolical agency at work in our affairs. And if any
      man gives an entertainment, and hears afar a general, ill-suppressed,
      derisive titter, and sees all his guests hurrying towards one spot, I defy
      him to remain unmoved and uninquisitive. I defy him still more to take
      that precise occasion (however much he may have before designed it) to
      drop gracefully on his right knee before the handsomest Mrs. M'Catchley in
      the universe, and&mdash;pop the question! Richard Avenel blurted out
      something very like an oath; and, half guessing that something must have
      happened that it would not be pleasing to bring immediately under the
      notice of Mrs. M'Catchley, he said hastily, "Excuse me. I'll just go and
      see what is the matter; pray, stay till I come back." With that he sprang
      forward; in a minute he was in the midst of the group, that parted aside
      with the most obliging complacency to make way for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's the matter?" he asked impatiently, yet fearfully. Not a voice
      answered. He strode on, and beheld his nephew in the arms of a woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless my soul!" said Richard Avenel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      And such a woman!
    </h3>
    <p>
      She had on a cotton gown,&mdash;very neat, I dare say, for an
      under-housemaid; and such thick shoes! She had on a little black straw
      bonnet; and a kerchief, that might have cost tenpence, pinned across her
      waist instead of a shawl; and she looked altogether-respectable, no doubt,
      but exceedingly dusty! And she was hanging upon Leonard's neck, and
      scolding, and caressing, and crying very loud. "God bless my soul!" said
      Mr. Richard Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he uttered that innocent self-benediction, the woman hastily turned
      round, and darting from Leonard, threw herself right upon Richard Avenel&mdash;burying
      under her embrace blue-coat, moss rose, white waistcoat and all&mdash;with
      a vehement sob and a loud exclamation!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! brother Dick!&mdash;dear, dear brother Dick! And I lives to see thee
      agin!" And then came two such kisses&mdash;you might have heard them a
      mile off! The situation of brother Dick was appalling; and the crowd, that
      had before only tittered politely, could not now resist the effect of this
      sudden embrace. There was a general explosion! It was a roar! That roar
      would have killed a weak man; but it sounded to the strong heart of
      Richard Avenel like the defiance of a foe, and it plucked forth in an
      instant from all conventional let and barrier the native spirit of the
      Anglo-Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted abruptly his handsome masculine head, and looked round the ring
      of his ill-bred visitors with a haughty stare of rebuke and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies and gentlemen," then said he, very coolly, "I don't see what there
      is to laugh at! A brother and sister meet after many years' separation,
      and the sister cries, poor thing. For my part I think it very natural that
      she should cry; but not that you should laugh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the whole shame was removed from Richard Avenel, and rested
      in full weight upon the bystanders. It is impossible to say how foolish
      and sheepish they all looked, nor how slinkingly each tried to creep off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Avenel seized his advantage with the promptitude of a man who had
      got on in America, and was, therefore, accustomed to make the best of
      things. He drew Mrs. Fairfield's arm in his, and led her into the house;
      but when he had got her safe into his parlour&mdash;Leonard following all
      the time&mdash;and the door was closed upon those three, then Richard
      Avenel's ire burst forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You impudent, ungrateful, audacious&mdash;drab!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, drab was the word. I am shocked to say it, but the duties of a
      historian are stern: and the word was drab.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drab!" faltered poor Jane Fairfield; and she clutched hold of Leonard to
      save herself from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" cried Leonard, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might as well have cried "sir" to a mountain torrent. Richard hurried
      on, for he was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You nasty, dirty, dusty dowdy! How dare you come here to disgrace me in
      my own house and premises, after my sending you L50! To take the very
      time, too, when&mdash;when Richard gasped for breath; and the laugh of his
      guests rang in his ears, and got into his chest, and choked him. Jane
      Fairfield drew herself up, and her tears were dried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not come to disgrace you! I came to see my boy, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" interrupted Richard, "to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to Leonard: "You have written to this woman, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I have not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not lie; and he is as good as yourself, and better, Richard
      Avenel," exclaimed Mrs. Fairfield; "and I won't stand here and hear him
      insulted,&mdash;that's what I won't. And as for your L50, there are
      forty-five of it; and I'll work my fingers to the bone till I pay back the
      other five. And don't be afeard I shall disgrace you, for I'll never look
      on your face agin; and you're a wicked, bad man,&mdash;that's what you
      are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman's voice was so raised and so shrill, that any other and
      more remorseful feeling which Richard might have conceived was drowned in
      his apprehensions that she would be overheard by his servants or his
      guests,&mdash;a masculine apprehension, with which females rarely
      sympathize; which, on the contrary, they are inclined to consider a mean
      and cowardly terror on the part of their male oppressors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! hold your infernal squall,&mdash;do'." said Mr. Avenel, in a tone
      that he meant to be soothing. "There&mdash;sit down&mdash;and don't stir
      till I come back again, and can talk to you calmly. Leonard, follow me,
      and help to explain things to our guests."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard stood still, but shook his head slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, sir?" said Richard Avenel, in a very portentous growl.
      "Shaking your head at me? Do you intend to disobey me? You had better take
      care!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard's front rose; he drew one arm round his mother, and thus he spoke,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, you have been kind to me, and generous, and that thought alone
      silenced my indignation when I heard you address such language to my
      mother; for I felt that, if I spoke, I should say too much. Now I speak,
      and it is to say, shortly, that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, boy," said poor Mrs. Fairfield, frightened; "don't mind me. I did
      not come to make mischief, and ruin your prospex. I'll go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you ask her pardon, Mr. Avenel?" said Leonard, firmly; and he
      advanced towards his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, naturally hot and intolerant of contradiction, was then excited,
      not only by the angry emotions, which, it must be owned, a man so
      mortified, and in the very flush of triumph, might well experience, but by
      much more wine than he was in the habit of drinking; and when Leonard
      approached him, he misinterpreted the movement into one of menace and
      aggression. He lifted his arm: "Come a step nearer," said he, between his
      teeth, "and I'll knock you down." Leonard advanced the forbidden step; but
      as Richard caught his eye, there was something in that eye&mdash;not
      defying, not threatening, but bold and dauntless&mdash;which Richard
      recognized and respected, for that something spoke the Freeman. The
      uncle's arm mechanically fell to his side. "You cannot strike me, Mr.
      Avenel," said Leonard, "for you are aware that I could not strike again my
      mother's brother. As her son, I once more say to you,&mdash;ask her
      pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten thousand devils! Are you mad?&mdash;or do you want to drive me mad?
      You insolent beggar, fed and clothed by my charity! Ask her pardon!&mdash;what
      for? That she has made me the object of jeer and ridicule with that d&mdash;-d
      cotton gown and those double-d&mdash;-d thick shoes&mdash;I vow and
      protest they've got nails in them! Hark ye, sir, I've been insulted by
      her, but I'm not to be bullied by you. Come with me instantly, or I
      discard you; not a shilling of mine shall you have as long as I live. Take
      your choice: be a peasant, a labourer, or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A base renegade to natural affection, a degraded beggar indeed!" cried
      Leonard, his breast heaving, and his cheeks in a glow. "Mother, Mother,
      come away. Never fear,&mdash;I have strength and youth, and we will work
      together as before."
    </p>
    <p>
      But poor Mrs. Fairfield, overcome by her excitement, had sunk down into
      Richard's own handsome morocco leather easy-chair, and could neither speak
      nor stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confound you both!" muttered Richard. "You can't be seen creeping out of
      my house now. Keep her here, you young viper, you; keep her till I come
      back; and then, if you choose to go, go and be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Not finishing his sentence, Mr. Avenel hurried out of the room, and locked
      the door, putting the key into his pocket. He paused for a moment in the
      hall, in order to collect his thoughts, drew three or four deep breaths,
      gave himself a great shake, and, resolved to be faithful to his principle
      of doing one thing at a time, shook off in that shake all disturbing
      recollection of his mutinous captives. Stern as Achilles when he appeared
      to the Trojans, Richard Avenel stalked back to his lawn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Brief as had been his absence, the host could see that, in the interval, a
      great and notable change had come over the spirit of his company. Some of
      those who lived in the town were evidently preparing to return home on
      foot; those who lived at a distance, and whose carriages (having been sent
      away, and ordered to return at a fixed hour) had not yet arrived, were
      gathered together in small knots and groups; all looked sullen and
      displeased, and all instinctively turned from their host as he passed them
      by. They felt they had been lectured, and they were more put out than
      Richard himself. They did not know if they might not be lectured again.
      This vulgar man, of what might he not be capable? Richard's shrewd sense
      comprehended in an instant all the difficulties of his position; but he
      walked on deliberately and directly towards Mrs. M'Catchley, who was
      standing near the grand marquee with the Pompleys and the dean's lady. As
      those personages saw him make thus boldly towards them, there was a
      flutter. "Hang the fellow!" said the colonel, intrenching himself in his
      stock, "he is coming here. Low and shocking&mdash;what shall we do? Let us
      stroll on." But Richard threw himself in the way of the retreat. "Mrs.
      M'Catchley," said he, very gravely, and offering her his arm, "allow me
      three words with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor widow looked very much discomposed. Mrs. Pompley pulled her by
      the sleeve. Richard still stood gazing into her face, with his arm
      extended. She hesitated a minute, and then took the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monstrous impudent!" cried the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let Mrs. M'Catchley alone, my dear," responded Mrs. Pompley; "she will
      know how to give him a lesson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," said Richard, as soon as he and his companion were out of
      hearing, "I rely on you to do me a favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On you, and you alone. You have influence with all those people, and a
      word from you will effect what I desire. Mrs. M'Catchley," added Richard,
      with a solemnity that was actually imposing, "I flatter myself that you
      have some friendship for me, which is more than I can say of any other
      soul in these grounds; will you do me this favour, ay or no?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Mr. Avenel?" asked Mrs. M'Catchley, much disturbed, and
      somewhat softened,&mdash;for she was by no means a woman without feeling;
      indeed, she considered herself nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get all your friends&mdash;all the company, in short-to come back into
      the tent for refreshments, for anything. I want to say a few words to
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me! Mr. Avenel&mdash;a few words!" cried the widow, "but that's
      just what they're all afraid of. You must pardon me, but you really can't
      ask people to a dejeune dansant, and then&mdash;scold 'em!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to scold them," said Air. Avenel, very seriously,&mdash;"upon
      my honour, I'm not. I'm going to make all right, and I even hope
      afterwards that the dancing may go on&mdash;and that you will honour me
      again with your hand. I leave you to your task; and believe me, I'm not an
      ungrateful man." He spoke, and bowed&mdash;not without some dignity&mdash;and
      vanished within the breakfast division of the marquee. There he busied
      himself in re-collecting the waiters, and directing them to re-arrange the
      mangled remains of the table as they best could. Mrs. M'Catchley, whose
      curiosity and interest were aroused, executed her commission with all the
      ability and tact of a woman of the world, and in less than a quarter of an
      hour the marquee was filled, the corks flew, the champagne bounced and
      sparkled, people drank in silence, munched fruits and cakes, kept up their
      courage with the conscious sense of numbers, and felt a great desire to
      know what was coming. Mr. Avenel, at the head of the table, suddenly rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies and Gentlemen," said he, "I have taken the liberty to invite you
      once more into this tent, in order to ask you to sympathize with me upon
      an occasion which took us all a little by surprise to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, you all know I am a new man,&mdash;the maker of my own
      fortunes."
    </p>
    <p>
      A great many heads bowed involuntarily. The words were said manfully, and
      there was a general feeling of respect. "Probably, too," resumed Mr.
      Avenel, "you may know that I am the son of very honest tradespeople. I say
      honest, and they are not ashamed of me; I say tradespeople, and I'm not
      ashamed of them. My sister married and settled at a distance. I took her
      son to educate and bring up. But I did not tell her where he was, nor even
      that I had returned from America; I wished to choose my own time for that,
      when I could give her the surprise, not only of a rich brother, but of a
      son whom I intended to make a gentleman, so far as manners and education
      can make one. Well, the poor dear woman has found me out sooner than I
      expected, and turned the tables on me by giving me a surprise of her own
      invention. Pray, forgive the confusion this little family-scene has
      created; and though I own it was very laughable at the moment, and I was
      wrong to say otherwise, yet I am sure I don't judge ill of your good
      hearts, when I ask you to think what brother and sister must feel who
      parted from each other when they were boy and girl. To me" (and Richard
      gave a great gulp, for he felt that a great gulp alone could swallow the
      abominable lie he was about to utter)&mdash;"to me this has been a very
      happy occasion! I'm a plain man: no one can take ill what I've said. And
      wishing that you may be all as happy in your family as I am in mine&mdash;humble
      though it be&mdash;I beg to drink your very good healths!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a universal applause when Richard sat down; and so well in his
      plain way had he looked the thing, and done the thing, that at least half
      of those present&mdash;who till then had certainly disliked and half
      despised him&mdash;suddenly felt that they were proud of his acquaintance.
      For however aristocratic this country of ours may be, and however
      especially aristocratic be the genteeler classes in provincial towns and
      coteries, there is nothing which English folks, from the highest to the
      lowest, in their hearts so respect as a man who has risen from nothing,
      and owns it frankly. Sir Compton Delaval, an old baronet, with a pedigree
      as long as a Welshman's, who had been reluctantly decoyed to the feast by
      his three unmarried daughters&mdash;not one of whom, however, had hitherto
      condescended even to bow to the host&mdash;now rose. It was his right,&mdash;he
      was the first person there in rank and station.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ladies and Gentlemen," quoth Sir Compton Delaval, "I am sure that I
      express the feelings of all present when I say that we have heard with
      great delight and admiration the words addressed to us by our excellent
      host. [Applause.] And if any of us, in what&mdash;Mr. Avenel describes
      justly as the surprise of the moment, were betrayed into an unseemly
      merriment at&mdash;at&mdash;[the dean's lady whispered 'some of the']&mdash;some
      of the&mdash;some of the&mdash;" repeated Sir Compton, puzzled, and coming
      to a deadlock ["holiest sentiments," whispered the dean's lady]&mdash;"ay,
      some of the holiest sentiments in our nature, I beg him to accept our
      sincerest apologies. I can only say, for my part, that I am proud to rank
      Mr. Avenel amongst the gentlemen of the county" (here Sir Compton gave a
      sounding thump on the table), "and to thank him for one of the most
      brilliant entertainments it has ever been my lot to witness. If he won his
      fortune honestly, he knows how to spend it nobly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whiz went a fresh bottle of champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not accustomed to public speaking, but I could not repress my
      sentiments. And I've now only to propose to you the health of our host.
      Richard Avenel, Esquire; and to couple with that the health of his&mdash;very
      interesting sister, and long life to them both."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was half drowned in enthusiastic plaudits, and in three
      cheers for Richard Avenel, Esquire, and his very interesting sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a cursed humbug," thought Richard Avenel, as he wiped his forehead;
      "but the world is such a humbug!" Then he glanced towards Mrs. M'Catehley
      and, to his great satisfaction, saw Mrs. M'Catchley with her handkerchief
      before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth must be told; although the fair widow might certainly have
      contemplated the probability of accepting Mr. Avenel as a husband, she had
      never before felt the least bit in love with him; and now she did. There
      is something in courage and candour&mdash;in a word, in manliness&mdash;that
      all women, the most worldly, do admire in men; and Richard Avenel, humbug
      though his conscience said he was, seemed to Mrs. M'Catchley like a hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host saw his triumph. "Now for another dance!" said he, gayly; and he
      was about to offer his hand to Mrs. M'Catchley, when Sir Compton Delaval
      seizing it, and giving it a hearty shake, cried, "You have not yet danced
      with my eldest daughter; so if you'll not ask her, why, I must offer her
      to you as your partner. Here, Sarah."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sarah Delaval, who was five feet eight, and as stately as she was
      tall, bowed her head graciously; and Mr. Avenel, before he knew where he
      was, found her leaning on his arm. But as he passed into the next division
      of the tent, he had to run the gauntlet of all the gentlemen, who thronged
      round to shake hands with him. Their warm English hearts could not be
      satisfied till they had so repaired the sin of their previous haughtiness
      and mockery. Richard Avenel might then have safely introduced his sister&mdash;gown,
      kerchief, thick shoes, and all&mdash;to the crowd; but he had no such
      thought. He thanked Heaven devoutly that she was safely under lock and
      key.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the third dance that he could secure Mrs. M'Catchley's
      hand, and then it was twilight. The carriages were at the door, but no one
      yet thought of going. People were really enjoying themselves. Mr. Avenel
      had had time, in the interim, to mature all his plans for completing and
      consummating that triumph which his tact and pluck had drawn from his
      momentary disgrace. Excited as he was with wine, and suppressed passion,
      he had yet the sense to feel that, when all the halo that now surrounded
      him had evaporated, and Mrs. M'Catchley was redelivered up to the
      Pompleys, whom he felt to be the last persons his interest could desire
      for her advisers, the thought of his low relations would return with calm
      reflection. Now was the time. The iron was hot, now was the time to strike
      it, and forge the enduring chain. As he led Mrs. M'Catchley after the
      dance, into the lawn, he therefore said tenderly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "How shall I thank you for the favour you have done me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Mrs. M'Catchley, warmly, "It was no favour, and I am so glad&mdash;"
      She stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not ashamed of me, then, in spite of what has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ashamed of you! Why, I should be so proud of you, if I were&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finish the sentence and say&mdash;'your wife!'&mdash;there, it is out. My
      dear madam, I am rich, as you know; I love you very heartily. With your
      help, I think I can make a figure in a larger world than this: and that,
      whatever my father, my grandson at least will be&mdash;but it is time
      enough to speak of him. What say you?&mdash;you&mdash;turn away. I'll not
      tease you,&mdash;it is not my way. I said before, ay or no; and your
      kindness so emboldens me that I say it again, ay or no?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you take me so unawares&mdash;so&mdash;so&mdash;Lord! my dear Mr.
      Avenel; you are so hasty&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;" And the widow actually
      blushed, and was genuinely bashful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those horrid Pompleys!" thought Richard, as he saw the colonel bustling
      up with Mrs. M'Catchley's cloak on his arm. "I press for your answer,"
      continued the suitor, speaking very fast. "I shall leave this place
      to-morrow, if you will not give it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave this place&mdash;leave me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will be mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Mr. Avenel!" said the widow, languidly, and leaving her hand in his,
      "who can resist you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Up came Colonel Pompley; Richard took the shawl: "No hurry for that now,
      Colonel,&mdash;Mrs. M'Catchley feels already at home here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes afterwards, Richard Avenel so contrived that it was known by
      the whole company that their host was accepted by the Honourable Mrs.
      M'Catchley. And every one said, "He is a very clever man and a very good
      fellow," except the Pompleys&mdash;and the Pompleys were frantic. Mr.
      Richard Avenel had forced his way into the aristocracy of the country; the
      husband of an Honourable, connected with peers!
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will stand for our city&mdash;Vulgarian!" cried the colonel. "And his
      wife will walk out before me," cried the colonel's lady,&mdash;"nasty
      woman!" And she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guests were gone; and Richard had now leisure to consider what course
      to pursue with regard to his sister and her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      His victory over his guests had in much softened his heart towards his
      relations; but he still felt bitterly aggrieved at Mrs. Fairfield's
      unseasonable intrusion, and his pride was greatly chafed by the boldness
      of Leonard. He had no idea of any man whom he had served, or meant to
      serve, having a will of his own, having a single thought in opposition to
      his pleasure. He began, too, to feel that words had passed between him and
      Leonard which could not be well forgotten by either, and would render
      their close connection less pleasant than heretofore. He, the great
      Richard Avenel, beg pardon of Mrs. Fairfield, the washerwoman! No; she and
      Leonard must beg his. "That must be the first step," said Richard Avenel;
      "and I suppose they have come to their senses." With that expectation, he
      unlocked the door of his parlour, and found himself in complete solitude.
      The moon, lately risen, shone full into the room, and lit up every corner.
      He stared round bewildered,&mdash;the birds had flown. "Did they go
      through the keyhole?" said Air. Avenel. "Ha! I see! the window is open!"
      The window reached to the ground. Mr. Avenel, in his excitement, had
      forgotten that easy mode of egress. "Well," said he, throwing himself into
      his easy-chair, "I suppose I shall soon hear from them: they'll be wanting
      my money fast enough, I fancy." His eye caught sight of a letter,
      unsealed, lying on the table. He opened it, and saw bank-notes to the
      amount of L50,&mdash;the widow's forty-five country notes, and a new note,
      Bank of England, that he had lately given to Leonard. With the money were
      these lines, written in Leonard's bold, clear writing, though a word or
      two here and there showed that the hand had trembled,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   I thank you for all you have done to one whom you regarded as the
   object of charity. My mother and I forgive what has passed. I
   depart with her. You bade me make my choice, and I have made it.

   LEONARD FAIRFIELD.
</pre>
    <p>
      The paper dropped from Richard's hand, and he remained mute and remorseful
      for a moment. He soon felt, however, that he had no help for it but
      working himself up into a rage. "Of all people in the world," cried
      Richard, stamping his foot on the floor, "there are none so disagreeable,
      insolent, and ungrateful as poor relations. I wash my hands of them!"

      INITIAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHEREIN MR. CAXTON IS PROFOUNDLY METAPHYSICAL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Life," said my father, in his most dogmatical tone, "is a certain
      quantity in time, which may be regarded in two ways,&mdash;First, as life
      integral; Second, as life fractional. Life integral is that complete whole
      expressive of a certain value, large or small, which each man possesses in
      himself. Life fractional is that same whole seized upon and invaded by
      other people, and subdivided amongst them. They who get a large slice of
      it say, 'A very valuable life this!' Those who get but a small handful
      say, 'So, so; nothing very great!' Those who get none of it in the
      scramble exclaim, 'Good for nothing!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand a word you are saying," growled Captain Roland.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father surveyed his brother with compassion: "I will make it all clear,
      even to your understanding. When I sit down by myself in my study, having
      carefully locked the door on all of you, alone with my books and thoughts,
      I am in full possession of my integral life. I am totus, teres, atque
      rotundus,&mdash;a whole human being, equivalent in value, we will say, for
      the sake of illustration, to a fixed round sum, L100 for example. But when
      I go forth into the common apartment, each of those to whom I am of any
      worth whatsoever puts his finger into the bag that contains me, and takes
      out of me what he wants. Kitty requires me to pay a bill; Pisistratus to
      save him the time and trouble of looking into a score or two of books; the
      children to tell them stories, or play at hide-and-seek; and so on
      throughout the circle to which I have incautiously given myself up for
      plunder and subdivision. The L100 which I represented in my study is now
      parcelled out; I am worth L40 or L50 to Kitty, L20 to Pisistratus, and
      perhaps 30s. to the children. This is life fractional. And I cease to be
      an integral till once more returning to my study, and again closing the
      door on all existence but my own. Meanwhile, it is perfectly clear that to
      those who, whether I am in the study or whether I am in the common
      sitting-room, get nothing at all out of me, I am not worth a farthing. It
      must be wholly indifferent to a native of Kamschatka whether Austin Caxton
      be or be not razed out of the great account-book of human beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hence," continued my father,&mdash;"hence it follows that the more
      fractional a life be&mdash;that is, the greater the number of persons
      among whom it can be subdivided&mdash;why, the more there are to say, 'A
      very valuable life that!' Thus the leader of a political party, a
      conqueror, a king, an author, who is amusing hundreds or thousands or
      millions, has a greater number of persons whom his worth interests and
      affects than a Saint Simeon Stylites could have when he perched himself at
      the top of a column; although, regarded each in himself, Saint Simeon, in
      his grand mortification of flesh, in the idea that he thereby pleased his
      Divine Benefactor, might represent a larger sum of moral value per se than
      Bonaparte or Voltaire."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Perfectly clear, sir; but I don't see what it has to
      do with 'My Novel.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Everything. Your novel, if it is to be a full and
      comprehensive survey of the 'Quicquid agunt homines' (which it ought to
      be, considering the length and breadth to which I foresee, from the slow
      development of your story, you meditate extending and expanding it), will
      embrace the two views of existence,&mdash;the integral and the fractional.
      You have shown us the former in Leonard, when he is sitting in his
      mother's cottage, or resting from his work by the little fount in
      Riccabocca's garden. And in harmony with that view of his life, you have
      surrounded him with comparative integrals, only subdivided by the tender
      hands of their immediate families and neighbours,&mdash;your squires and
      parsons, your Italian exile and his Jemima. With all these, life is, more
      or less, the life natural, and this is always, more or less, the life
      integral. Then comes the life artificial, which is always, more or less,
      the life fractional. In the life natural, wherein we are swayed but by our
      own native impulses and desires, subservient only to the great silent law
      of Virtue (which has pervaded the universe since it swung out of chaos), a
      man is of worth from what he is in himself,&mdash;Newton was as worthy
      before the apple fell from the tree as when all Europe applauded the
      discoverer of the Principle of Gravity. But in the life artificial we are
      only of worth inasmuch as we affect others; and, relative to that life,
      Newton rose in value more than a million per cent when down fell the apple
      from which ultimately sprang up his discovery. In order to keep
      civilization going and spread over the world the light of human intellect,
      we have certain desires within us, ever swelling beyond the ease and
      independence which belongs to us as integrals. Cold man as Newton might be
      (he once took a lady's hand in his own, Kitty, and used her forefinger for
      his tobacco-stopper,&mdash;great philosopher!), cold as he might be, he
      was yet moved into giving his discoveries to the world, and that from
      motives very little differing in their quality from the motives that make
      Dr. Squills communicate articles to the 'Phrenological Journal' upon the
      skulls of Bushmen and wombats. For it is the property of light to travel.
      When a man has light in him, forth it must go. But the first passage of
      genius from its integral state (in which it has been reposing on its own
      wealth) into the fractional is usually through a hard and vulgar pathway.
      It leaves behind it the reveries of solitude,&mdash;that
      self-contemplating rest which may be called the Visionary,&mdash;and
      enters suddenly into the state that may be called the Positive and Actual.
      There it sees the operations of money on the outer life; sees all the
      ruder and commoner springs of action; sees ambition without nobleness,
      love without romance; is bustled about and ordered and trampled and cowed,&mdash;in
      short, it passes an apprenticeship with some Richard Avenel, and does not
      detect what good and what grandeur, what addition even to the true poetry
      of the social universe, fractional existences like Richard Avenel's
      bestow; for the pillars that support society are like those of the Court
      of the Hebrew Tabernacle,&mdash;they are of brass, it is true, but they
      are filleted with silver. From such intermediate state Genius is expelled
      and driven on its way, and would have been so in this case had Mrs.
      Fairfield (who is but the representative of the homely natural affections,
      strongest ever in true genius,&mdash;for light is warm) never crushed Mr.
      Avenel's moss rose on her sisterly bosom. Now, forth from this passage and
      defile of transition into the larger world, must Genius go on, working out
      its natural destiny amidst things and forms the most artificial. Passions
      that move and influence the world are at work around it. Often lost sight
      of itself, its very absence is a silent contrast to the agencies present.
      Merged and vanished for a while amidst the Practical World, yet we
      ourselves feel all the while that it is there; is at work amidst the
      workings around it. This practical world that effaces it rose out of some
      genius that has gone before; and so each man of genius, though we never
      come across him, as his operations proceed in places remote from our
      thoroughfares, is yet influencing the practical world that ignores him,
      for ever and ever. That is GENIUS! We can't describe it in books; we can
      only hint and suggest it by the accessories which we artfully heap about
      it. The entrance of a true Probationer into the terrible ordeal of
      Practical Life is like that into the miraculous cavern, by which, legend
      informs us, Saint Patrick converted Ireland."

      BLANCHE.&mdash;"What is that legend? I never heard of it."

      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"My dear, you will find it in a thin folio at the right
      on entering my study, written by Thomas Messingham, and called
      'Florilegium Insulae Sanctorum,' etc. The account therein is confirmed by
      the relation of an honest soldier, one Louis Ennius, who had actually
      entered the cavern. In short, the truth of the legend is undeniable,
      unless you mean to say, which I can't for a moment suppose, that Louis
      Ennius was a liar. Thus it runs: Saint Patrick, finding that the Irish
      pagans were incredulous as to his pathetic assurances of the pains and
      torments destined to those who did not expiate their sins in this world,
      prayed for a miracle to convince them. His prayer was heard; and a certain
      cavern, so small that a man could not stand up therein at his ease, was
      suddenly converted into a Purgatory, comprehending tortures sufficient to
      convince the most incredulous. One unacquainted with human nature might
      conjecture that few would be disposed to venture voluntarily into such a
      place; on the contrary, pilgrims came in crowds. Now, all who entered from
      vain curiosity or with souls unprepared perished miserably; but those who
      entered with deep and earnest faith, conscious of their faults, and if
      bold, yet humble, not only came out safe and sound, but purified, as if
      from the waters of a second baptism. See Savage and Johnson at night in
      Fleet Street,&mdash;and who shall doubt the truth of Saint Patrick's
      Purgatory!" Therewith my father sighed; closed his Lucian, which had lain
      open on the table, and would read none but "good books" for the rest of
      the evening.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On their escape from the prison to which Mr. Avenel had condemned them,
      Leonard and his mother found their way to a small public-house that lay at
      a little distance from the town, and on the outskirts of the high road.
      With his arm round his mother's waist, Leonard supported her steps, and
      soothed her excitement. In fact, the poor woman's nerves were greatly
      shaken, and she felt an uneasy remorse at the injury her intrusion had
      inflicted on the young man's worldly prospects. As the shrewd reader has
      guessed already, that infamous tinker was the prime agent of evil in this
      critical turn in the affairs of his quondam customer; for, on his return
      to his haunts around Hazeldean and the Casino, the tinker had hastened to
      apprise Mrs. Fairfield of his interview with Leonard, and, on finding that
      she was not aware that the boy was under the roof of his uncle, the
      pestilent vagabond (perhaps from spite against Mr. Avenel, or perhaps from
      that pure love of mischief by which metaphysical critics explain the
      character of Iago, and which certainly formed a main element in the
      idiosyncrasy of Mr. Sprott) had so impressed on the widow's mind the
      haughty demeanour of the uncle, and the refined costume of the nephew,
      that Mrs. Fairfield had been seized with a bitter and insupportable
      jealousy. There was an intention to rob her of her boy!&mdash;he was to be
      made too fine for her. His silence was now accounted for. This sort of
      jealousy, always more or less a feminine quality, is often very strong
      amongst the poor; and it was the more strong in Mrs. Fairfield, because,
      lone woman that she was, the boy was all in all to her. And though she was
      reconciled to the loss of his presence, nothing could reconcile her to the
      thought that his affections should be weaned from her. Moreover, there
      were in her mind certain impressions, of the justice of which the reader
      may better judge hereafter, as to the gratitude&mdash;more than ordinarily
      filial&mdash;which Leonard owed to her. In short, she did not like, as she
      phrased it, "to be shaken off;" and after a sleepless night she resolved
      to judge for herself, much moved thereto by the malicious suggestions to
      that effect made by Mr. Sprott, who mightily enjoyed the idea of
      mortifying the gentlemen by whom he had been so disrespectfully threatened
      with the treadmill. The widow felt angry with Parson Dale and with the
      Riccaboccas: she thought they were in the plot against her; she
      communicated therefore, her intentions to none, and off she set,
      performing the journey partly on the top of the coach, partly on foot. No
      wonder that she was dusty, poor woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, oh, boy!" said she, half sobbing, "when I got through the
      lodge-gates, came on the lawn, and saw all that power o' fine folk, I said
      to myself, says I&mdash;for I felt fritted&mdash;I'll just have a look at
      him and go back. But ah, Lenny, when I saw thee, looking so handsome, and
      when thee turned and cried 'Mother,' my heart was just ready to leap out
      o' my mouth, and so I could not help hugging thee, if I had died for it.
      And thou wert so kind, that I forgot all Mr. Sprott had said about Dick's
      pride, or thought he had just told a fib about that, as he had wanted me
      to believe a fib about thee. Then Dick came up&mdash;and I had not seen
      him for so many years&mdash;and we come o' the same father and mother; and
      so&mdash;and so&mdash;" The widow's sobs here fairly choked her. "Ah," she
      said, after giving vent to her passion, and throwing her arms round
      Leonard's neck, as they sat in the little sanded parlour of the
      public-house,&mdash;"ah, and I've brought thee to this. Go back; go back,
      boy, and never mind me."
    </p>
    <p>
      With some difficulty Leonard pacified poor Mrs. Fairfield, and got her to
      retire to bed; for she was, indeed, thoroughly exhausted. He then stepped
      forth into the road; musingly. All the stars were out; and Youth, in its
      troubles, instinctively looks up to the stars. Folding his arms, Leonard
      gazed on the heavens, and his lips murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this trance, for so it might be called, he was awakened by a voice in
      a decidedly London accent; and, turning hastily round, saw Mr. Avenel's
      very gentlemanlike butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard's first idea was that his uncle had repented, and sent in search
      of him. But the butler seemed as much surprised at the rencontre as
      himself: that personage, indeed, the fatigues of the day being over, was
      accompanying one of Mr. Gunter's waiters to the public-house (at which the
      latter had secured his lodging), having discovered an old friend in the
      waiter, and proposing to regale himself with a cheerful glass, and&mdash;THAT
      of course&mdash;abuse of his present situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Fairfield!" exclaimed the butler, while the waiter walked discreetly
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard looked, and said nothing. The butler began to think that some
      apology was due for leaving his plate and his pantry, and that he might as
      well secure Leonard's propitiatory influence with his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir," said he, touching his hat, "I was just a showing Mr. Giles
      the way to the Blue Bells, where he puts up for the night. I hope my
      master will not be offended. If you are a going back, sir, would you
      kindly mention it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not going back, Jarvis," answered Leonard, after a pause; "I am
      leaving Mr. Avenel's house, to accompany my mother,&mdash;rather suddenly.
      I should be very much obliged to you if you would bring some things of
      mine to me at the Blue Bells. I will give you the list, if you will step
      with me to the inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for a reply, Leonard then turned towards the inn, and made
      his humble inventory: item, the clothes he had brought with him from the
      Casino; item, the knapsack that had contained them; item, a few books,
      ditto; item, Dr. Riccabocca's watch; item, sundry manuscripts, on which
      the young student now built all his hopes of fame and fortune. This list
      he put into Mr. Jarvis's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said the butler, twirling the paper between his finger and thumb,
      "you're not a going for long, I hope?" and he looked on the face of the
      young man, who had always been "civil spoken to him," with as much
      curiosity and as much compassion as so apathetic and princely a personage
      could experience in matters affecting a family less aristocratic than he
      had hitherto condescended to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Leonard, simply and briefly; "and your master will no doubt
      excuse you for rendering me this service." Mr. Jarvis postponed for the
      present his glass and chat with the waiter, and went back at once to Mr.
      Avenel. That gentleman, still seated in his library, had not been aware of
      the butler's absence; and when Mr. Jarvis entered and told him that he had
      met Mr. Fairfield, and communicating the commission with which he was
      intrusted, asked leave to execute it, Mr. Avenel felt the man's
      inquisitive eye was on him, and conceived new wrath against Leonard for a
      new humiliation to his pride. It was awkward to give no explanation of his
      nephew's departure, still more awkward to explain. After a short pause,
      Mr. Avenel said sullenly, "My nephew is going away on business for some
      time,&mdash;do what he tells you;" and then turned his back, and lighted
      his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That beast of a boy," said he, soliloquizing, "either means this as an
      affront, or an overture: if an affront, he is, indeed, well got rid of; if
      an overture, he will soon make a more respectful and proper one. After
      all, I can't have too little of relations till I have fairly secured Mrs.
      M'Catchley. An Honourable! I wonder if that makes me an Honourable too?
      This cursed Debrett contains no practical information on those points."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the clothes and the watch with which Mr. Avenel presented
      Leonard were returned, with a note meant to express gratitude, but
      certainly written with very little knowledge of the world; and so full of
      that somewhat over-resentful pride which had in earlier life made Leonard
      fly from Hazeldean, and refuse all apology to Randal, that it is not to be
      wondered at that Mr. Avenel's last remorseful feelings evaporated in ire.
      "I hope he will starve!" said the uncle, vindictively.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, my dear mother," said Leonard the next morning, as, with
      knapsack on his shoulder and Mrs. Fairfield on his arm, he walked along
      the high road; "I do assure you from my heart that I do not regret the
      loss of favours which I see plainly would have crushed out of me the very
      sense of independence. But do not fear for me; I have education and
      energy,&mdash;I shall do well for myself, trust me.&mdash;No, I cannot, it
      is true, go back to our cottage; I cannot be a gardener again. Don't ask
      me,&mdash;I should be discontented, miserable. But I will go up to London!
      That's the place to make a fortune and a name: I will make both. Oh, yes,
      trust me, I will. You shall soon be proud of your Leonard; and then we
      will always live together,&mdash;always! Don't cry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what can you do in Lunnon,&mdash;such a big place, Lenny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Every year does not some lad leave our village, and go and seek his
      fortune, taking with him but health and strong hands? I have these, and I
      have more: I have brains and thoughts and hopes, that&mdash;again I say,
      No, no; never fear for me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy threw back his head proudly; there was something sublime in his
      young trust in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well. But you will write to Mr. Dale or to me? I will get Mr. Dale or the
      good mounseer (now I know they were not agin me) to read your letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, boy, you have nothing in your pockets. We have paid Dick; these, at
      least, are my own, after paying the coach fare." And she would thrust a
      sovereign and some shillings into Leonard's waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some resistance, he was forced to consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's a sixpence with a hole in it. Don't part with that, Lenny; it
      will bring thee good luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus talking, they gained the inn where the three roads met, and from
      which a coach went direct to the Casino. And here, without entering the
      inn, they sat on the greensward by the hedgerow, waiting the arrival of
      the coach&mdash;Mrs. Fairfield was much subdued in spirits, and there was
      evidently on her mind something uneasy,&mdash;some struggle with her
      conscience. She not only upbraided herself for her rash visit, but she
      kept talking of her dead Mark. And what would he say of her, if he could
      see her in heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was so selfish in me, Lenny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, pooh! Has not a mother a right to her child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay, ay!" cried Mrs. Fairfield. "I do love you as a child,&mdash;my
      own child. But if I was not your mother, after all, Lenny, and cost you
      all this&mdash;oh, what would you say of me then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not my own mother!" said Leonard, laughing as he kissed her. "Well, I
      don't know what I should say then differently from what I say now,&mdash;that
      you, who brought me up and nursed and cherished me, had a right to my home
      and my heart, wherever I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless thee!" cried Mrs. Fairfield, as she pressed him to her heart. "But
      it weighs here,&mdash;it weighs," she said, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the coach appeared, and Leonard ran forward to inquire if
      there was an outside place. Then there was a short bustle while the horses
      were being changed; and Mrs. Fairfield was lifted up to the roof of the
      vehicle, so all further private conversation between her and Leonard
      ceased. But as the coach whirled away, and she waved her hand to the boy,
      who stood on the road-side gazing after her, she still murmured, "It
      weighs here,&mdash;it weighs!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard walked sturdily on in the high road to the Great City. The day was
      calm and sunlit, but with a gentle breeze from gray hills at the distance;
      and with each mile that he passed, his step seemed to grow more firm, and
      his front more elate. Oh, it is such joy in youth to be alone with one's
      daydreams! And youth feels so glorious a vigour in the sense of its own
      strength, though the world be before and&mdash;against it! Removed from
      that chilling counting-house, from the imperious will of a patron and
      master, all friendless, but all independent, the young adventurer felt a
      new being, felt his grand nature as Man. And on the Man rushed the genius
      long interdicted and thrust aside,&mdash;rushing back, with the first
      breath of adversity, to console&mdash;no! the Man needed not consolation,&mdash;to
      kindle, to animate, to rejoice! If there is a being in the world worthy of
      our envy, after we have grown wise philosophers of the fireside, it is not
      the palled voluptuary, nor the careworn statesman, nor even the great
      prince of arts and letters, already crowned with the laurel, whose leaves
      are as fit for poison as for garlands; it is the young child of adventure
      and hope. Ay, and the emptier his purse, ten to one but the richer his
      heart, and the wider the domains which his fancy enjoys as he goes on with
      kingly step to the Future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till towards the evening did our adventurer slacken his pace and think
      of rest and refreshment. There, then, lay before him on either side the
      road those wide patches of uninclosed land which in England often denote
      the entrance to a village. Presently one or two neat cottages came in
      sight; then a small farmhouse, with its yard and barns. And some way
      farther yet, he saw the sign swinging before an inn of some pretensions,&mdash;the
      sort of inn often found on a long stage between two great towns commonly
      called "The Halfway House." But the inn stood back from the road, having
      its own separate sward in front, whereon was a great beech-tree (from
      which the sign extended) and a rustic arbour; so that to gain the inn, the
      coaches that stopped there took a sweep from the main thoroughfare.
      Between our pedestrian and the inn there stood, naked and alone, on the
      common land, a church; our ancestors never would have chosen that site for
      it; therefore it was a modern church,&mdash;modern Gothic; handsome to an
      eye not versed in the attributes of ecclesiastical architecture, very
      barbarous to an eye that was. Somehow or other the church looked cold and
      raw and uninviting. It looked a church for show,&mdash;much too big for
      the scattered hamlet, and void of all the venerable associations which
      give their peculiar and unspeakable atmosphere of piety to the churches in
      which succeeding generations have knelt and worshipped. Leonard paused and
      surveyed the edifice with an unlearned but poetical gaze; it dissatisfied
      him. And he was yet pondering why, when a young girl passed slowly before
      him, her eyes fixed on the ground, opened the little gate that led into
      the churchyard, and vanished. He did not see the child's face; but there
      was something in her movements so utterly listless, forlorn, and sad that
      his heart was touched. What did she there? He approached the low wall with
      a noiseless step, and looked over it wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      There by a grave, evidently quite recent, with no wooden tomb nor
      tombstone like the rest, the little girl had thrown herself, and she was
      sobbing loud and passionately. Leonard opened the gate, and approached her
      with a soft step. Mingled with her sobs, he heard broken sentences, wild
      and vain, as all human sorrowings over graves must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father! oh, Father, do you not really hear me? I am so lone, so lone!
      Take me to you,&mdash;take me!" And she buried her face in the deep grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" said Leonard, in a half whisper,&mdash;"he is not there.
      Look above!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not heed him; he put his arm round her waist gently; she made
      a gesture of impatience and anger, but she would not turn her face, and
      she clung to the grave with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      After clear, sunny days the dews fall more heavily; and now, as the sun
      set, the herbage was bathed in a vaporous haze,&mdash;a dim mist rose
      around. The young man seated himself beside her, and tried to draw the
      child to his breast. Then she turned eagerly, indignantly, and pushed him
      aside with jealous arms. He profaned the grave! He understood her with his
      deep poet-heart, and rose. There was a pause. Leonard was the first to
      break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to your home with me, my child, and we will talk of him by the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him! Who are you? You did not know him!" said the girl, still with anger.
      "Go away! Why do you disturb me? I do no one harm. Go! go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do yourself harm, and that will grieve him if he sees you yonder!
      Come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The child looked at him through her blinding tears, and his face softened
      and soothed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go!" she said, very plaintively, and in subdued accents. "I will but stay
      a minute more. I&mdash;I have so much to say yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard left the churchyard, and waited without; and in a short time the
      child came forth, waived him aside as he approached her, and hurried away.
      He followed her at a distance, and saw her disappear within the inn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Hip-Hip-Hurrah!" Such was the sound that greeted our young traveller as
      he reached the inn door,&mdash;a sound joyous in itself, but sadly out of
      harmony with the feelings which the child sobbing on the tombless grave
      had left at his heart. The sound came from within, and was followed by
      thumps and stamps, and the jingle of glasses. A strong odour of tobacco
      was wafted to his olfactory sense. He hesitated a moment at the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him, on benches under the beech-tree and within the arbour, were
      grouped sundry athletic forms with "pipes in the liberal air."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady, as she passed across the passage to the taproom, caught
      sight of his form at the doorway, and came forward. Leonard still stood
      irresolute. He would have gone on his way, but for the child: she had
      interested him strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem full, ma'am," said he. "Can I have accommodation for the night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, indeed, sir," said the landlady, civilly, "I can give you a bedroom,
      but I don't know where to put you meanwhile. The two parlours and the
      tap-room and the kitchen are all choke-full. There has been a great
      cattle-fair in the neighbourhood, and I suppose we have as many as fifty
      farmers and drovers stopping here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, ma'am, I can sit in the bedroom you are kind enough to give
      me; and if it does not cause you much trouble to let me have some tea
      there, I should be glad; but I can wait your leisure. Do not put yourself
      out of the way for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady was touched by a consideration she was not much habituated to
      receive from her bluff customers. "You speak very handsome, sir, and we
      will do our best to serve you, if you will excuse all faults. This way,
      sir." Leonard lowered his knapsack, stepped into the passage, with some
      difficulty forced his way through a knot of sturdy giants in top-boots or
      leathern gaiters, who were swarining in and out the tap-room, and followed
      his hostess upstairs to a little bedroom at the top of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is small, sir, and high," said the hostess, apologetically. "But there
      be four gentlemen farmers that have come a great distance, and all the
      first floor is engaged; you will be more out of the noise here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can suit me better. But, stay,&mdash;pardon me;" and Leonard,
      glancing at the garb of the hostess, observed she was not in mourning. "A
      little girl whom I saw in the churchyard yonder, weeping very bitterly&mdash;is
      she a relation of yours? Poor child! she seems to have deeper feelings
      than are common at her age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir," said the landlady, putting the corner of her apron to her eyes,
      "it is a very sad story. I don't know what to do. Her father was taken ill
      on his way to Lunnon, and stopped here, and has been buried four days. And
      the poor little girl seems to have no relations&mdash;and where is she to
      go? Laryer Jones says we must pass her to Marybone parish, where her
      father lived last; and what's to become of her then? My heart bleeds to
      think on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there rose such an uproar from below, that it was evident some
      quarrel had broken out; and the hostess, recalled to her duties, hastened
      to carry thither her propitiatory influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard seated himself pensively by the little lattice. Here was some one
      more alone in the world than he; and she, poor orphan, had no stout man's
      heart to grapple with fate, and no golden manuscripts that were to be as
      the "Open-Sesame" to the treasures of Aladdin. By and by, the hostess
      brought him up a tray with tea and other refreshments, and Leonard resumed
      his inquiries. "No relatives?" said he; "surely the child must have some
      kinsfolk in London? Did her father leave no directions, or was he in
      possession of his faculties?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; he was quite reasonable like to the last. And I asked him if he
      had not anything on his mind, and he said, 'I have.' And I said, 'Your
      little girl, sir?' And he answered me, 'Yes, ma'am;' and laying his head
      on his pillow, he wept very quietly. I could not say more myself, for it
      set me off to see him cry so meekly; but my husband is harder nor I, and
      he said, 'Cheer up, Mr. Digby; had not you better write to your friends?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Friends!' said the gentleman, in such a voice! 'Friends I have but one,
      and I am going to Him! I cannot take her there!' Then he seemed suddenly
      to recollect himself, and called for his clothes, and rummaged in the
      pockets as if looking for some address, and could not find it. He seemed a
      forgetful kind of gentleman, and his hands were what I call helpless
      hands, sir! And then he gasped out, 'Stop, stop! I never had the address.
      Write to Lord Les&mdash;', something like Lord Lester, but we could not
      make out the name. Indeed he did not finish it, for there was a rush of
      blood to his lips; and though he seemed sensible when he recovered (and
      knew us and his little girl too, till he went off smiling), he never spoke
      word more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor man," said Leonard, wiping his eyes. "But his little girl surely
      remembers the name that he did not finish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. She says he must have meant a gentleman whom they had met in the Park
      not long ago, who was very kind to her father, and was Lord something; but
      she don't remember the name, for she never saw him before or since, and
      her father talked very little about any one lately, but thought he should
      find some kind friends at Screwstown, and travelled down there with her
      from Lunnon. But she supposes he was disappointed, for he went out, came
      back, and merely told her to put up the things, as they must go back to
      Lunnon. And on his way there he&mdash;died. Hush, what's that? I hope she
      did not overhear us. No, we were talking low. She has the next room to
      your'n, sir. I thought I heard her sobbing. Hush!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the next room? I hear nothing. Well, with your leave, I will speak to
      her before I quit you. And had her father no money with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a few sovereigns, sir; they paid for his funeral, and there is a
      little left still,&mdash;enough to take her to town; for my husband said,
      says he, 'Hannah, the widow gave her mite, and we must not take the
      orphan's;' and my husband is a hard man, too, sir&mdash;bless him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me take your hand, ma'am. God reward you both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "La, sir! why, even Dr. Dosewell said, rather grumpily though, 'Never mind
      my bill; but don't call me up at six o'clock in the morning again, without
      knowing a little more about people.' And I never afore knew Dr. Dosewell
      go without his bill being paid. He said it was a trick o' the other doctor
      to spite him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What other doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a very good gentleman, who got out with Mr. Digby when he was taken
      ill, and stayed till the next morning; and our doctor says his name is
      Morgan, and he lives in Lunnou, and is a homy&mdash;something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Homicide," suggested Leonard, ignorantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, homicide; something like that, only a deal longer and worse. But he
      left some of the tiniest little balls you ever see, sir, to give the
      child; but, bless you, they did her no good,&mdash;how should they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tiny balls, oh&mdash;homoeopathist&mdash;I understand. And the doctor was
      kind to her; perhaps he may help her. Have you written to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we don't know his address, and Lunnon is a vast place, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to London and will find it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir, you seem very kind; and sin' she must go to Lunnon (for what can
      we do with her here?&mdash;she's too genteel for service), I wish she was
      going with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With me!" said Leonard, startled,&mdash;"with me! Well, why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure she comes of good blood, sir. You would have known her father
      was quite the gentleman, only to see him die, sir. He went off so kind and
      civil like, as if he was ashamed to give so much trouble,&mdash;quite a
      gentleman, if ever there was one. And so are you, sir, I'm sure," said the
      land lady, courtesying; "I know what gentlefolk be. I've been a
      housekeeper in the first of families in this very shire, sir, though I
      can't say I've served in Lunnon; and so, as gentlefolks know each other, I
      've no doubt you could find out her relations. Dear, dear! Coming,
      coming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there were loud cries for the hostess, and she hurried away. The
      farmers and drovers were beginning to depart, and their bills were to be
      made out and paid. Leonard saw his hostess no more that night. The last
      Hip-hip-hurrah was heard,&mdash;some toast, perhaps to the health of the
      county members,&mdash;and the chamber of woe beside Leonard's rattled with
      the shout. By and by, silence gradually succeeded the various dissonant
      sounds below. The carts and gigs rolled away; the clatter of hoofs on the
      road ceased; there was then a dumb dull sound as of locking-up, and low,
      humming voices below, and footsteps mounting the stairs to bed, with now
      and then a drunken hiccough or maudlin laugh, as some conquered votary of
      Bacchus was fairly carried up to his domicile.
    </p>
    <p>
      All, then, at last was silent, just as the clock from the church sounded
      the stroke of eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, meanwhile, had been looking over his manuscripts. There was first
      a project for an improvement on the steam-engine,&mdash;a project that had
      long lain in his mind, begun with the first knowledge of mechanics that he
      had gleaned from his purchases of the tinker. He put that aside now,&mdash;it
      required too great an effort of the reasoning faculty to re-examine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced less hastily over a collection of essays on various subjects,&mdash;some
      that he thought indifferent, some that he thought good. He then lingered
      over a collection of verses written in his best hand with loving care,&mdash;verses
      first inspired by his perusal of Nora's melancholy memorials. These verses
      were as a diary of his heart and his fancy,&mdash;those deep, unwitnessed
      struggles which the boyhood of all more thoughtful natures has passed in
      its bright yet murky storm of the cloud and the lightning-flash, though
      but few boys pause to record the crisis from which slowly emerges Man. And
      these first desultory grapplings with the fugitive airy images that flit
      through the dim chambers of the brain had become with each effort more
      sustained and vigorous, till the phantoms were spelled, the flying ones
      arrested, the Immaterial seized, and clothed with Form. Gazing on his last
      effort, Leonard felt that there at length spoke forth the poet. It was a
      work which though as yet but half completed, came from a strong hand; not
      that shadow trembling on unsteady waters, which is but the pale reflex and
      imitation of some bright mind, sphered out of reach and afar, but an
      original substance,&mdash;a life, a thing of the Creative Faculty,&mdash;breathing
      back already the breath it had received. This work had paused during
      Leonard's residence with Mr. Avenel, or had only now and then, in stealth,
      and at night, received a rare touch. Now, as with a fresh eye he reperused
      it, and with that strange, innocent admiration, not of self&mdash;for a
      man's work is not, alas! himself,&mdash;it is the beautified and idealized
      essence, extracted he knows not how from his own human elements of clay;
      admiration known but to poets,&mdash;their purest delight, often their
      sole reward. And then with a warmer and more earthly beat of his full
      heart, he rushed in fancy to the Great City, where all rivers of fame
      meet, but not to be merged and lost, sallying forth again, individualized
      and separate, to flow through that one vast Thought of God which we call
      THE WORLD.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put up his papers; and opened his window, as was his ordinary custom,
      before he retired to rest,&mdash;for he had many odd habits; and he loved
      to look out into the night when he prayed. His soul seemed to escape from
      the body&mdash;to mount on the air, to gain more rapid access to the far
      Throne in the Infinite&mdash;when his breath went forth among the winds,
      and his eyes rested fixed on the stars of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the boy prayed silently; and after his prayer he was about,
      lingeringly, to close the lattice, when he heard distinctly sobs close at
      hand. He paused, and held his breath, then looked gently out; the casement
      next his own was also open. Someone was also at watch by that casement,&mdash;perhaps
      also praying. He listened yet more intently, and caught, soft and low, the
      words, "Father, Father, do you hear me now?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard opened his door and stole towards that of the room adjoining; for
      his first natural impulse had been to enter and console. But when his
      touch was on the handle, he drew back. Child though the mourner was, her
      sorrows were rendered yet more sacred from intrusion by her sex.
      Something, he knew not what, in his young ignorance, withheld him from the
      threshold. To have crossed it then would have seemed to him profanation.
      So he returned, and for hours yet he occasionally heard the sobs, till
      they died away, and childhood wept itself to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next morning, when he heard his neighbour astir, he knocked gently
      at her door: there was no answer. He entered softly, and saw her seated
      very listlessly in the centre of the room,&mdash;as if it had no familiar
      nook or corner as the rooms of home have, her hands drooping on her lap,
      and her eyes gazing desolately on the floor. Then he approached and spoke
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was very subdued, and very silent. Her tears seemed dried up; and it
      was long before she gave sign or token that she heeded him. At length,
      however, he gradually succeeded in rousing her interest; and the first
      symptom of his success was in the quiver of her lip, and the overflow of
      her downcast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By little and little he wormed himself into her confidence; and she told
      him in broken whispers her simple story. But what moved him the most was,
      that beyond her sense of loneliness she did not seem to feel her own
      unprotected state. She mourned the object she had nursed and heeded and
      cherished, for she had been rather the protectress than the protected to
      the helpless dead. He could not gain from her any more satisfactory
      information than the landlady had already imparted, as to her friends and
      prospects; but she permitted him passively to look among the effects her
      father had left, save only that, if his hand touched something that seemed
      to her associations especially holy, she waved him back, or drew it
      quickly away. There were many bills receipted in the name of Captain
      Digby, old yellow faded music-scores for the flute, extracts of Parts from
      Prompt Books, gay parts of lively comedies, in which heroes have so noble
      a contempt for money,&mdash;fit heroes for a Sheridan and a Farquhar;
      close by these were several pawnbroker's tickets; and, not arrayed
      smoothly, but crumpled up, as if with an indignant nervous clutch of the
      helpless hands, some two or three letters. He asked Helen's permission to
      glance at these, for they might afford a clew to friends. Helen gave the
      permission by a silent bend of the head. The letters, however, were but
      short and freezing answers from what appeared to be distant connections or
      former friends, or persons to whom the deceased had applied for some
      situation. They were all very disheartening in their tone. Leonard next
      endeavoured to refresh Helen's memory as to the name of the nobleman which
      had been last on her father's lips; but there he failed wholly. For it may
      be remembered that Lord L'Estrange, when he pressed his loan on Mr. Digby,
      and subsequently told that gentleman to address him at Mr. Egerton's, had,
      from a natural delicacy, sent the child on, that she might not witness the
      charity bestowed on the father; and Helen said truly that Mr. Digby had
      sunk latterly into an habitual silence on all his affairs. She might have
      heard her father mention the name, but she had not treasured it up; all
      she could say was, that she should know the stranger again if she met him,
      and his dog too. Seeing that the child had grown calm, Leonard was then
      going to leave the room, in order to confer with the hostess, when she
      rose suddenly, though noiselessly, and put her little hand in his, as if
      to detain him. She did not say a word; the action said all,&mdash;said,
      "Do not desert me." And Leonard's heart rushed to his lips, and he
      answered to the action, as he bent down, and kissed her cheek, "Orphan,
      will you go with me? We have one Father yet to both of us, and He will
      guide us on earth. I am fatherless like you." She raised her eyes to his,
      looked at him long, and then leaned her head confidingly on his strong
      young shoulder.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At noon that same day the young man and the child were on their road to
      London. The host had at first a little demurred at trusting Helen to so
      young a companion; but Leonard, in his happy ignorance, had talked so
      sanguinely of finding out this lord, or some adequate protectors for the
      child; and in so grand a strain, though with all sincerity, had spoken of
      his own great prospects in the metropolis (he did not say what they were!)
      that had he been the craftiest impostor he could not more have taken in
      the rustic host. And while the landlady still cherished the illusive fancy
      that all gentlefolks must know each other in London, as they did in a
      county, the landlord believed, at least, that a young man so respectably
      dressed, although but a foot-traveller, who talked in so confident a tone,
      and who was so willing to undertake what might be rather a burdensome
      charge, unless he saw how to rid himself of it, would be sure to have
      friends older and wiser than himself, who would judge what could best be
      done for the orphan.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was the host to do with her? Better this volunteered escort, at
      least, than vaguely passing her on from parish to parish, and leaving her
      friendless at last in the streets of London. Helen, too, smiled for the
      first time on being asked her wishes, and again put her hand in Leonard's.
      In short, so it was settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl made up a bundle of the things she most prized or needed.
      Leonard did not feel the additional load, as he slung it to his knapsack;
      the rest of the luggage was to be sent to London as soon as Leonard wrote
      (which he promised to do soon) and gave an address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen paid her last visit to the churchyard; and she joined her companion
      as he stood on the road, without the solemn precincts. And now they had
      gone on some hours; and when he asked her if she were tired, she still
      answered "No." But Leonard was merciful, and made their day's journey
      short; and it took them some days to reach London. By the long lonely way
      they grew so intimate, at the end of the second day, they called each
      other brother and sister; and Leonard, to his delight, found that as her
      grief, with the bodily movement and the change of scene, subsided from its
      first intenseness and its insensibility to other impressions, she
      developed a quickness of comprehension far beyond her years. Poor child!
      that had been forced upon her by Necessity. And she understood him in his
      spiritual consolations, half poetical, half religious; and she listened to
      his own tale, and the story of his self-education and solitary struggles,&mdash;those,
      too, she understood. But when he burst out with his enthusiasm, his
      glorious hopes, his confidence in the fate before them, then she would
      shake her head very quietly and very sadly. Did she comprehend them! Alas!
      perhaps too well. She knew more as to real life than he did. Leonard was
      at first their joint treasurer; but before the second day was over, Helen
      seemed to discover that he was too lavish; and she told him so, with a
      prudent grave look, putting her hand on his arm as he was about to enter
      an inn to dine; and the gravity would have been comic, but that the eyes
      through their moisture were so meek and grateful. She felt he was about to
      incur that ruinous extravagance on her account. Somehow or other, the
      purse found its way into her keeping, and then she looked proud and in her
      natural element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! what happy meals under her care were provided; so much more enjoyable
      than in dull, sanded inn-parlours, swarming with flies, and reeking with
      stale tobacco. She would leave him at the entrance of a village, bound
      forward, and cater, and return with a little basket and a pretty blue jug&mdash;which
      she had bought on the road,&mdash;the last filled with new milk; the first
      with new bread, and some special dainty in radishes or water-tresses. And
      she had such a talent for finding out the prettiest spot whereon to halt
      and dine: sometimes in the heart of a wood,&mdash;so still, it was like a
      forest in fairy tales, the hare stealing through the alleys, or the
      squirrel peeping at them from the boughs; sometimes by a little brawling
      stream, with the fishes seen under the clear wave, and shooting round the
      crumbs thrown to them. They made an Arcadia of the dull road up to their
      dread Thermopylae, the war against the million that waited them on the
      other side of their pass through Tempo.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we be as happy when we are great?" said Leonard, in his grand
      simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen sighed, and the wise little head was shaken.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At last they came within easy reach of London; but Leonard had resolved
      not to enter the metropolis fatigued and exhausted, as a wanderer needing
      refuge, but fresh and elate, as a conqueror coming in triumph to take
      possession of the capital. Therefore they halted early in the evening of
      the day preceding this imperial entry, about six miles from the
      metropolis, in the neighbourhood of Ealing (for by that route lay their
      way). They were not tired on arriving at their inn. The weather was
      singularly lovely, with that combination of softness and brilliancy which
      is only known to the rare true summer days of England; all below so green,
      above so blue,&mdash;days of which we have about six in the year, and
      recall vaguely when we read of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, of Damsel and
      Knight in Spenser's golden Summer Song, or of Jacques, dropped under the
      oak-tree, watching the deer amidst the dells of Ardennes. So, after a
      little pause at their inn, they strolled forth, not for travel but
      pleasure, towards the cool of sunset, passing by the grounds that once
      belonged to the Duke of Kent, and catching a glimpse of the shrubs and
      lawns of that beautiful domain through the lodge-gates; then they crossed
      into some fields, and came to a little rivulet called the Brent. Helen had
      been more sad that day than on any during their journey,&mdash;perhaps
      because, on approaching London, the memory of her father became more
      vivid; perhaps from her precocious knowledge of life, and her foreboding
      of what was to befall them, children that they both were. But Leonard was
      selfish that day; he could not be influenced by his companion's sorrow; he
      was so full of his own sense of being, and he already caught from the
      atmosphere the fever that belongs to anxious capitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit here, sister," said he, imperiously, throwing himself under the shade
      of a pollard-tree that overhung the winding brook, "sit here and talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung off his hat, tossed back his rich curls, and sprinkled his brow
      from the stream that eddied round the roots of the tree that bulged out,
      bald and gnarled, from the bank and delved into the waves below. Helen
      quietly obeyed him, and nestled close to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so this London is really very vast,&mdash;VERY?" he repeated
      inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very," answered Helen, as, abstractedly, she plucked the cowslips near
      her, and let them fall into the running waters. "See how the flowers are
      carried down the stream! They are lost now. London is to us what the river
      is to the flowers, very vast, very strong;" and she added, after a pause,
      "very cruel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cruel! Ah, it has been so to you; but now&mdash;now I will take care of
      you!" he smiled triumphantly; and his smile was beautiful both in its
      pride and its kindness. It is astonishing how Leonard had altered since he
      had left his uncle's. He was both younger and older; for the sense of
      genius, when it snaps its shackles, makes us both older and wiser as to
      the world it soars to, younger and blinder as to the world it springs
      from.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is not a very handsome city, either, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very ugly indeed," said Helen, with some fervour; "at least all I have
      seen of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there must be parts that are prettier than others? You say there are
      parks: why should not we lodge near them and look upon the green trees?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be nice," said Helen, almost joyously; "but&mdash;" and here
      the head was shaken&mdash;"there are no lodgings for us except in courts
      and alleys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" echoed Helen, with a smile, and she held up the purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! always that horrid purse; as if, too, we were not going to fill it!
      Did not I tell you the story of Fortunio? Well, at all events, we will go
      first to the neighbourhood where you last lived, and learn there all we
      can; and then the day after to-morrow I will see this Dr. Morgan, and find
      out the lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears started to Helen's soft eyes. "You want to get rid of me soon,
      brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! Ah, I feel so happy to have you with me it seems to me as if I had
      pined for you all my life, and you had come at last; for I never had
      brother nor sister nor any one to love, that was not older than myself,
      except&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except the young lady you told me of," said Helen, turning away her face;
      for children are very jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I loved her, love her still. But that was different," said Leonard.
      "I could never have talked to her as to you: to you I open my whole heart;
      you are my little Muse, Helen: I confess to you my wild whims and fancies
      as frankly as if I were writing poetry." As he said this, a step was
      heard, and a shadow fell over the stream. A belated angler appeared on the
      margin, drawing his line impatiently across the water, as if to worry some
      dozing fish into a bite before it finally settled itself for the night.
      Absorbed in his occupation, the angler did not observe the young persons
      on the sward under the tree, and he halted there, close upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse that perch!" said he, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, sir," cried Leonard; for the man, in stepping back, nearly
      trod upon Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The angler turned. "What 's the matter? Hist! you have frightened my
      perch. Keep still, can't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen drew herself out of the way, and Leonard remained motionless. He
      remembered Jackeymo, and felt a sympathy for the angler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the most extraordinary perch, that!" muttered the stranger,
      soliloquizing. "It has the devil's own luck. It must have been born with a
      silver spoon in its mouth, that damned perch! I shall never catch it,&mdash;never!
      Ha! no, only a weed. I give it up." With this, he indignantly jerked his
      rod from the water and began to disjoint it. While leisurely engaged in
      this occupation, he turned to Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! are you intimately acquainted with this stream, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered Leonard. "I never saw it before."
    </p>
    <p>
      ANGLER, (solemnly).&mdash;"Then, young man, take my advice, and do not
      give way to its fascinations. Sir, I am a martyr to this stream; it has
      been the Delilah of my existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (interested, the last sentence seemed to him poetical).&mdash;"The
      Delilah! sir, the Delilah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      ANGLER.&mdash;"The Delilah. Young man, listen, and be warned by example.
      When I was about your age, I first came to this stream to fish. Sir, on
      that fatal day, about three p.m., I hooked up a fish,&mdash;such a big
      one, it must have weighed a pound and a half. Sir, it was that length;"
      and the angler put finger to wrist. "And just when I had got it nearly
      ashore, by the very place where you are sitting, on that shelving bank,
      young man, the line broke, and the perch twisted himself among those
      roots, and&mdash;cacodaemon that he was&mdash;ran off, hook and all. Well,
      that fish haunted me; never before had I seen such a fish. Minnows I had
      caught in the Thames and elsewhere, also gudgeons, and occasionally a
      dace. But a fish like that&mdash;a PERCH, all his fins up, like the sails
      of a man-of-war&mdash;a monster perch,&mdash;a whale of a perch! No, never
      till then had I known what leviathans lie hid within the deeps. I could
      not sleep till I had returned; and again, sir,&mdash;I caught that perch.
      And this time I pulled him fairly out of the water. He escaped; and how
      did he escape? Sir, he left his eye behind him on the hook. Years, long
      years, have passed since then; but never shall I forget the agony of that
      moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"To the perch, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      ANGLER.&mdash;"Perch! agony to him! He enjoyed it. Agony to me! I gazed on
      that eye, and the eye looked as sly and as wicked as if it were laughing
      in my face. Well, sir, I had heard that there is no better bait for a
      perch than a perch's eye. I adjusted that eye on the hook, and dropped in
      the line gently. The water was unusually clear; in two minutes I saw that
      perch return. He approached the hook; he recognized his eye, frisked his
      tail, made a plunge, and, as I live, carried off the eye, safe and sound;
      and I saw him digesting it by the side of that water-lily. The mocking
      fiend! Seven times since that day, in the course of a varied and eventful
      life, have I caught that perch, and seven times has that perch escaped."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (astonished).&mdash;"It can't be the same perch; perches are very
      tender fish. A hook inside of it, and an eye hooked out of it&mdash;no
      perch could withstand such havoc in its constitution."
    </p>
    <p>
      ANGLER (with an appearance of awe).&mdash;"It does seem supernatural. But
      it is that perch; for hark ye, sir, there is ONLY ONE perch in the whole
      brook! All the years I have fished here, I have never caught another
      perch; and this solitary inmate of the watery element I know by sight
      better than I knew my own lost father. For each time that I have raised it
      out of the water, its profile has been turned to me, and I have seen with
      a shudder that it has had only&mdash;One Eye! It is a most mysterious and
      a most diabolical phenomenon, that perch! It has been the ruin of my
      prospects in life. I was offered a situation in Jamaica: I could not go
      with that perch left here in triumph. I might afterwards have had an
      appointinent in India, but I could not put the ocean between myself and
      that perch: thus have I frittered away my existence in the fatal
      metropolis of my native land. And once a week from February to December I
      come hither. Good heavens! if I should catch the perch at last, the
      occupation of my existence will be gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard gazed curiously at the angler, as the last thus mournfully
      concluded. The ornate turn of his periods did not suit with his costume.
      He looked wofully threadbare and shabby,&mdash;a genteel sort of
      shabbiness too,&mdash;shabbiness in black. There was humour in the corners
      of his lip; and his hands, though they did not seem very clean&mdash;indeed
      his occupation was not friendly to such niceties&mdash;were those of a man
      who had not known manual labour. His face was pale and puffed, but the tip
      of the nose was red. He did not seem as if the watery element was as
      familiar to himself as to his Delilah, the perch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such is Life!" recommenced the angler, in a moralizing tone, as he slid
      his rod into its canvas case. "If a man knew what it was to fish all one's
      life in a stream that has only one perch, to catch that one perch nine
      times in all, and nine times to see it fall back into the water, plump,&mdash;if
      a man knew what it was, why, then "&mdash;here the angler looked over his
      shoulder full at Leonard&mdash;"why then, young sir, he would know what
      human life is to vain ambition. Good-evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Away he went treading over the daisies and kingcups. Helen's eyes followed
      him wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a strange person!" said Leonard, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he is a very wise one," murmured Helen; and she came close up to
      Leonard, and took his hand in both hers, as if she felt already that he
      was in need of the Comforter,&mdash;the line broken, and the perch lost!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At noon the next day, London stole upon them through a gloomy, thick,
      oppressive atmosphere; for where is it that we can say London bursts on
      the sight? It stole on them through one of its fairest and most gracious
      avenues of approach,&mdash;by the stately gardens of Kensington, along the
      side of Hyde Park, and so on towards Cumberland Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was not the least struck. And yet with a very little money, and a
      very little taste, it would be easy to render this entrance to London as
      grand and as imposing as that to Paris from the Champs Elysees. As they
      came near the Edgware Road, Helen took her new brother by the hand and
      guided him; for she knew all that neighbourhood, and she was acquainted
      with a lodging near that occupied by her father (to that lodging itself
      she could not have gone for the world), where they might be housed
      cheaply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just then the sky, so dull and overcast since morning, seemed one mass
      of black cloud. There suddenly came on a violent storm of rain. The boy
      and girl took refuge in a covered mews, in a street running out of the
      Edgware Road. This shelter soon became crowded; the two young pilgrims
      crept close to the wall, apart from the rest, Leonard's arm round Helen's
      waist, sheltering her from the rain that the strong wind contending with
      it beat in through the passage. Presently a young gentleman of better mien
      and dress than the other refugees entered, not hastily, but rather with a
      slow and proud step, as if, though he deigned to take shelter, he scorned
      to run to it. He glanced somewhat haughtily at the assembled group, passed
      on through the midst of it, came near Leonard, took off his hat, and shook
      the rain from its brim. His head thus uncovered, left all his features
      exposed; and the village youth recognized, at the first glance, his old
      victorious assailant on the green at Hazeldean.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yet Randal Leslie was altered. His dark cheek was as thin as in boyhood,
      and even yet more wasted by intense study and night vigils; but the
      expression of his face was at once more refined and manly, and there was a
      steady concentrated light in his eye, like that of one who has been in the
      habit of bringing all his thoughts to one point. He looked older than he
      was. He was dressed simply in black, a colour which became him; and
      altogether his aspect and figure were, not showy indeed, but
      distinguished. He looked to the common eye a gentleman; and to the more
      observant a scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helter-skelter! pell-mell! the group in the passage now pressed each on
      each, now scattered on all sides, making way, rushing down the mews,
      against the walls, as a fiery horse darted under shelter. The rider, a
      young man with a very handsome face, and dressed with that peculiar care
      which we commonly call dandyism, cried out, good-humouredly, "Don't be
      afraid; the horse sha'n't hurt any of you. A thousand pardons&mdash;so ho!
      so ho!" He patted the horse, and it stood as still as a statue, filling up
      the centre of the passage. The groups resettled; Randal approached the
      rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank Hazeldean!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, is it indeed Randal Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank was off his horse in a moment, and the bridle was consigned to the
      care of a slim 'prentice-boy holding a bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow, how glad I am to see you. How lucky it was that I should
      turn in here. Not like me either, for I don't much care for a ducking.
      Staying in town, Randal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; at your uncle's, Mr. Egerton. I have left Oxford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have not taken your degree, I think? We Etonians all considered
      you booked for a double-first. Oh, we have been so proud of your fame,&mdash;you
      carried off all the prizes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not all; but some, certainly. Mr. Egerton offered me my choice,&mdash;to
      stay for my degree, or to enter at once into the Foreign Office. I
      preferred the end to the means. For, after all, what good are academical
      honours but as the entrance to life? To enter now is to save a step in a
      long way, Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you were always ambitious, and you will make a great figure, I am
      sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so&mdash;if I work for it. Knowledge is power." Leonard started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you!" resumed Randal, looking with some curious attention at his old
      schoolfellow. "You never came to Oxford. I did hear you were going into
      the army."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am in the Guards," said Frank, trying hard not to look too conceited as
      he made that acknowledgment. "The governor pished a little, and would
      rather I had come to live with him in the old Hall, and take to farming.
      Time enough for that, eh? By Jove, Randal, how pleasant a thing is life in
      London! Do you go to Almack's to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; Wednesday is a holiday in the House. There is a great parliamentary
      dinner at Mr. Egerton's. He is in the Cabinet now, you know; but you don't
      see much of your uncle, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our sets are different," said the young gentleman, in a tone of voice
      worthy of Brummel. "All those parliamentary fellows are devilish dull. The
      rain's over. I don't know whether the governor would like me to call at
      Grosvenor Square; but pray come and see me. Here's my card to remind you;
      you must dine at our mess. Such capital fellows! What day will you fix?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will call and let you know. Don't you find it rather expensive in the
      Guards? I remember that you thought the governor, as you call him, used to
      chafe a little when you wrote for more pocket-money; and the only time I
      ever saw you with tears in your eyes was when Mr. Hazeldean, in sending
      you L5, reminded you that his estates were not entailed,&mdash;were at his
      own disposal, and they should never go to an extravagant spendthrift. It
      was not a pleasant threat that, Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried the young man, colouring deeply. "It was not the threat that
      pained me; it was that my father could think so meanly of me as to fancy
      that&mdash;Well, well, but those were schoolboy days. And my father was
      always more generous than I deserved. We must see a great deal of each
      other, Randal. How good-natured you were at Eton, making my longs and
      shorts for me; I shall never forget it. Do call soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank swung himself into his saddle, and rewarded the slim youth with
      half-a-crown,&mdash;a largess four times more ample than his father would
      have deemed sufficient. A jerk of the reins and a touch of the heel, off
      bounded the fiery horse and the gay young rider. Randal mused, and as the
      rain had now ceased, the passengers under shelter dispersed and went their
      way. Only Randal, Leonard, and Helen remained behind. Then, as Randal,
      still musing, lifted his eyes, they fell full upon Leonard's face. He
      started, passed his hand quickly over his brow, looked again, hard and
      piercingly; and the change in his pale cheek to a shade still paler, a
      quick compression and nervous gnawing of his lip, showed that he too
      recognized an old foe. Then his glance ran over Leonard's dress, which was
      somewhat dust-stained, but far above the class amongst which the peasant
      was born. Randal raised his brows in surprise, and with a smile slightly
      supercilious&mdash;the smile stung Leonard&mdash;and with a slow step,
      Randal left the passage, and took his way towards Grosvenor Square. The
      Entrance of Ambition was clear to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the little girl once more took Leonard by the hand, and led him
      through rows of humble, obscure, dreary streets. It seemed almost like an
      allegory personified, as the sad, silent child led on the penniless and
      low-born adventurer of genius by the squalid shops and through the winding
      lanes, which grew meaner and meaner, till both their forms vanished from
      the view.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "But do come; change your dress, return and dine with me; you will have
      just time, Harley. You will meet the most eminent men of our party; surely
      they are worth your study, philosopher that you affect to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus said Audley Egerton to Lord L'Estrange, with whom he had been riding
      (after the toils of his office). The two gentlemen were in Audley's
      library,&mdash;Mr. Egerton, as usual, buttoned up, seated in his chair, in
      the erect posture of a man who scorns "inglorious ease;" Harley, as usual,
      thrown at length on the sofa., his long hair in careless curls, his
      neckcloth loose, his habiliments flowing simplex mundit is, indeed, his
      grace all his own; seemingly negligent, never slovenly; at ease everywhere
      and with every one, even with Mr. Audley Egerton, who chilled or awed the
      ease out of most people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, my dear Audley, forgive me. But your eminent men are all men of one
      idea, and that not a diverting one, politics! politics! politics! The
      storm in the saucer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is your life, Harley?&mdash;the saucer without the storm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, that's very well said, Audley? I did not think you had so
      much liveliness of repartee. Life! life! it is insipid, it is shallow,&mdash;no
      launching Argosies in the saucer. Audley, I have the oddest fancy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That of course," said Audley, dryly; "you never had any other. What is
      the new one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (with great gravity).&mdash;"Do you believe in Mesmerism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      AUDLEY.&mdash;"Certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"If it were in the power of an animal magnetizer to get me
      out of my own skin into somebody's else! That's my fancy! I am so tired of
      myself,&mdash;so tired! I have run through all my ideas,&mdash;know every
      one of them by heart. When some pretentious impostor of an idea perks
      itself up and says, 'Look at me,&mdash;I 'm a new acquaintance,' I just
      give it a nod, and say 'Not at all, you have only got a new coat on; you
      are the same old wretch that has bored me these last twenty years; get
      away.' But if one could be in a new skin, if I could be for half-an-hour
      your tall porter, or one of your eminent matter-of-fact men, I should then
      really travel into a new world.' Every man's brain must be a world in
      itself, eh? If I could but make a parochial settlement even in yours,
      Audley,&mdash;run over all your thoughts and sensations. Upon my life, I
      'll go and talk to that French mesmerizer about it."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [If, at the date in which Lord L'Estrange held this conversation
   with Mr. Egerton, Alfred de Musset had written his comedies, we
   should suspect that his lordship had plagiarized from one of them
   the whimsical idea that he here vents upon Audley. In repeating it,
   the author at least cannot escape from the charge of obligation to a
   writer whose humour is sufficiently opulent to justify the loan.]
</pre>
    <p>
      AUDLEY (who does not seem to like the notion of having his thoughts and
      sensations rummaged, even by his friend, and even in fancy)&mdash;"Pooh,
      pooh, pooh! Do talk like a man of sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Man of sense! Where shall I find a model? I don't know a
      man of sense!&mdash;never met such a creature. Don't believe it ever
      existed. At one time I thought Socrates must have been a man of sense: a
      delusion; he would stand gazing into the air, and talking to his Genius
      from sunrise to sunset. Is that like a man of sense? Poor Audley! how
      puzzled he looks! Well, I'll try and talk sense to oblige you. And first"
      (here Harley raised himself on his elbow),&mdash;"first, is it true, as I
      have heard vaguely, that you are paying court to the sister of that
      infamous Italian traitor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame di Negra? No: I am not paying court to her," answered Audley, with
      a cold smile. "But she is very handsome; she is very clever; she is useful
      to me,&mdash;I need not say how or why; that belongs to my metier as a
      politician. But I think, if you will take my advice, or get your friend to
      take it, I could obtain from her brother, through my influence with her,
      some liberal concessions to your exile. She is very anxious to know where
      he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not told her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I promised you I would keep that secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be sure you do; it is only for some mischief, some snare, that she could
      desire such information. Concessions! pooh! This is no question of
      concessions, but of rights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you should leave your friend to judge of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I will write to him. Meanwhile, beware of this woman. I have heard
      much of her abroad, and she has the character of her brother for duplicity
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beauty," interrupted Audley, turning the conversation with practised
      adroitness. "I am told that the count is one of the handsomest men in
      Europe, much handsomer than his sister still, though nearly twice her age.
      Tut, tut, Harley; fear not for me. I am proof against all feminine
      attractions. This heart is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay; it is not for you to speak thus,&mdash;leave that to me. But
      even I will not say it. The heart never dies. And you; what have you lost?&mdash;a
      wife; true: an excellent, noble-hearted woman. But was it love that you
      felt for her? Enviable man, have you ever loved?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not, Harley," said Audley, with a sombre aspect and in dejected
      accents; "very few men ever have loved, at least as you mean by the word.
      But there are other passions than love that kill the heart, and reduce us
      to mechanism."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Egerton spoke, Harley turned aside, and his breast heaved. There was
      a short silence; Audley was the first to break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speaking of my lost wife, I am sorry that you do not approve what I have
      done for her young kinsman, Randal Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (recovering himself with an effort).&mdash;"Is it true kindness to
      bid him exchange manly independence for the protection of an official
      patron?"
    </p>
    <p>
      AUDLEV.&mdash;"I did not bid him. I gave him his choice. At his age, I
      should have chosen as he has done."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"I trust not; I think better of you. But answer me one
      question frankly, and then I will ask another. Do you mean to make this
      young man your heir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      AUDLEY (with a slight embarrassment).&mdash;"Heir, pooh! I am young still.
      I may live as long as he&mdash;time enough to think of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Then now to my second question. Have you told this youth
      plainly that he may look to you for influence, but not for wealth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      AUDLEY (firmly).&mdash;"I think I have; but I shall repeat it more
      emphatically."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Then I am satisfied as to your conduct, but not as to his.
      For he has too acute an intellect not to know what it is to forfeit
      independence; and, depend on it, he has made his calculations, and would
      throw you into the bargain in any balance that he could strike in his
      favour. You go by your experience in judging men; I by my instincts.
      Nature warns us as it does the inferior animals,&mdash;only we are too
      conceited, we bipeds, to heed her. My instincts of soldier and gentleman
      recoil from that old young man. He has the soul of the Jesuit. I see it in
      his eye, I hear it in the tread of his foot; volto sciolto he has not; <i>i
      pensieri stretti</i> he has. Hist! I hear now his step in the hall. I
      should know it from a thousand. That's his very touch on the handle of the
      door."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie entered. Harley&mdash;who, despite his disregard for forms,
      and his dislike to Randal, was too high-bred not to be polite to his
      junior in age or inferior in rank-rose and bowed. But his bright piercing
      eyes did not soften as they caught and bore down the deeper and more
      latent fire in Randal's. Harley did not resume his seat, but moved to the
      mantelpiece, and leaned against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"I have fulfilled your commissions, Mr. Egerton. I went
      first to Maida Hill, and saw Mr. Burley. I gave him the check, but he said
      it was too much, and he should return half to the banker; he will write
      the article as you suggested. I then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      AUDLEY.&mdash;"Enough, Randal! we will not fatigue Lord L'Estrange with
      these little details of a life that displeases him,&mdash;the life
      political."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"But these details do not displease me; they reconcile me to
      my own life. Go on, pray, Mr. Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal had too much tact to need the cautioning glance of Mr. Egerton. He
      did not continue, but said with a soft voice, "Do you think, Lord
      L'Estrange, that the contemplation of the mode of life pursued by others
      can reconcile a man to his own, if he had before thought it needed a
      reconciler?" Harley looked pleased, for the question was ironical; and if
      there was a thing in the world be abhorred, it was flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Recollect your Lucretius, Mr. Leslie, the Suave mare, etc., 'pleasant
      from the cliff to see the mariners tossed on the ocean.' Faith, I think
      that sight reconciles one to the cliff, though, before, one might have
      been teased by the splash from the spray, and deafened by the scream of
      the sea-gulls. But I leave you, Audley. Strange that I have heard no more
      of my soldier! Remember I have your promise when I come to claim it.
      Good-by, Mr. Leslie, I hope that Burley's article will be worth the
      check."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange mounted his horse, which was still at the door, and rode
      through the Park. But he was no longer now unknown by sight. Bows and nods
      saluted him on every side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, I am found out, then," said he to himself. "That terrible Duchess
      of Knaresborough, too&mdash;I must fly my country." He pushed his horse
      into a canter, and was soon out of the Park. As he dismounted at his
      father's sequestered house, you would have hardly supposed him the same
      whimsical, fantastic, but deep and subtle humourist that delighted in
      perplexing the material Audley, for his expressive face was unutterably
      serious. But the moment he came into the presence of his parents, the
      countenance was again lighted and cheerful. It brightened the whole room
      like sunshine.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Mr. Leslie," said Egerton, when Harley had left the library, "you did not
      act with your usual discretion in touching upon matters connected with
      politics in the presence of a third party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel that already, sir; my excuse is, that I held Lord L'Estrange to be
      your most intimate friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A public man, Mr. Leslie, would ill serve his country if he were not
      especially reserved towards his private friends&mdash;when they do not
      belong to his party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But pardon me my ignorance. Lord Lansmere is so well known to be one of
      your supporters, that I fancied his son must share his sentiments, and be
      in your confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton's brows slightly contracted, and gave a stern expression to a
      countenance always firm and decided. He however answered in a mild tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the entrance into political life, Mr. Leslie, there is nothing in
      which a young man of your talents should be more on his guard than
      thinking for himself; he will nearly always think wrong. And I believe
      that is one reason why young men of talent disappoint their friends, and
      remain so long out of office."
    </p>
    <p>
      A haughty flush passed over Randal's brow, and faded away quickly; he
      bowed in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton resumed, as if in explanation, and even in kindly apology,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at Lord L'Estrange himself. What young man could come into life with
      brighter auspices? Rank, wealth, high animal spirits (a great advantage
      those same spirits, Mr. Leslie), courage, self-possession, scholarship as
      brilliant perhaps as your own; and now see how his life is wasted! Why? He
      always thought fit to think for himself. He could never be broken into
      harness, and never will be. The state coach, Mr. Leslie, requires that all
      the horses should pull together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With submission, sir," answered Randal, "I should think that there were
      other reasons why Lord L'Estrange, whatever be his talents&mdash;and of
      these you must be indeed an adequate judge&mdash;would never do anything
      in public life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and what?" said Egerton, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First," said Randal, shrewdly, "private life has done too much for him.
      What could public life give to one who needs nothing? Born at the top of
      the social ladder, why should he put himself voluntarily at the last step,
      for the sake of climbing up again? And secondly, Lord L'Estrange seems to
      me a man in whose organization sentiment usurps too large a share for
      practical existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a keen eye," said Audley, with some admiration,&mdash;"keen for
      one so young. Poor Harley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Egerton's last words were said to himself. He resumed quickly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something on my mind, my young friend. Let us be frank with each
      other. I placed before you fairly the advantages and disadvantages of the
      choice I gave you. To take your degree with such honours as no doubt you
      would have won, to obtain your fellowship, to go to the Bar, with those
      credentials in favour of your talents,&mdash;this was one career. To come
      at once into public life, to profit by my experience, avail yourself of my
      interest, to take the chances of rise or fall with a party,&mdash;this was
      another. You chose the last. But in so doing, there was a consideration
      which might weigh with you, and on which, in stating your reasons for your
      option, you were silent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might have counted on my fortune, should the chances of party fail
      you: speak, and without shame if so; it would be natural in a young man,
      who comes from the elder branch of the House whose heiress was my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wound me, Mr. Egerton," said Randal, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Egerton's cold glance followed Randal's movements; the face was hid
      from the glance, and the statesman's eye rested on the figure, which is
      often as self-betraying as the countenance itself. Randal baffled Mr.
      Egerton's penetration,&mdash;the young man's emotion might be honest pride
      and pained and generous feeling, or it might be something else. Egerton
      continued slowly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once for all, then, distinctly and emphatically, I say, never count upon
      that; count upon all else that I can do for you, and forgive me when I
      advise harshly or censure coldly; ascribe this to my interest in your
      career. Moreover, before decision becomes irrevocable, I wish you to know
      practically all that is disagreeable or even humiliating in the first
      subordinate steps of him who, without wealth or station, would rise in
      public life. I will not consider your choice settled till the end of a
      year at least,&mdash;your name will be kept on the college books till
      then; if on experience you should prefer to return to Oxford, and pursue
      the slower but surer path to independence and distinction, you can. And
      now give me your hand, Mr. Leslie, in sign that you forgive my bluntness:
      it is time to dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal, with his face still averted, extended his hand. Mr. Egerton held
      it a moment, then dropping it, left the room. Randal turned as the door
      closed; and there was in his dark face a power of sinister passion, that
      justified all Harley's warnings. His lips moved, but not audibly; then as
      if struck by a sudden thought, he followed Egerton into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said he, "I forgot to say, that on returning from Maida Hill, I
      took shelter from the rain under a covered passage, and there I met
      unexpectedly with your nephew, Frank Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Egerton, indifferently, "a fine young man; in the Guards. It is
      a pity that my brother has such antiquated political notions; he should
      put his son into parliament, and under my guidance; I could push him.
      Well, and what said Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He invited me to call on him. I remember that you once rather cautioned
      me against too intimate an acquaintance with those who have not got their
      fortunes to make."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they are idle, and idleness is contagious. Right,&mdash;better
      not to be too intimate with a young Guardsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you would not have me call on him, sir? We were rather friends at
      Eton; and if I wholly reject his overtures, might he not think that you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" interrupted Egerton. "Ah, true; my brother might think I bore him a
      grudge; absurd. Call then, and ask the young man here. Yet still, I do not
      advise intimacy." Egerton turned into his dressing-room. "Sir," said his
      valet, who was in waiting, "Mr. Levy is here,&mdash;he says by
      appointment; and Mr. Grinders is also just come from the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell Mr. Grinders to come in first," said Egerton, seating himself. "You
      need not wait; I can dress without you. Tell Mr. Levy I will see him in
      five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grinders was steward to Audley Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Levy was a handsome man, who wore a camellia in his button-hole;
      drove, in his cabriolet, a high-stepping horse that had cost L200; was
      well known to young men of fashion, and considered by their fathers a very
      dangerous acquaintance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the company assembled in the drawing-rooms, Mr. Egerton introduced
      Randal Leslie to his eminent friends in a way that greatly contrasted the
      distant and admonitory manner which he had exhibited to him in private.
      The presentation was made with that cordiality and that gracious respect,
      by which those who are in station command notice for those who have their
      station yet to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lord, let me introduce to you a kinsman of my late wife's" (in a
      whisper),&mdash;"the heir to the elder branch of her family. Stanmore,
      this is Mr. Leslie, of whom I spoke to you. You, who were so distinguished
      at Oxford, will not like him the worse for the prizes he gained there.
      Duke, let me present to you Mr. Leslie. The duchess is angry with me for
      deserting her balls; I shall hope to make my peace, by providing myself
      with a younger and livelier substitute. Ah, Mr. Howard, here is a young
      gentleman just fresh from Oxford, who will tell us all about the new sect
      springing up there. He has not wasted his time on billiards and horses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie was received with all that charming courtesy which is the To Kalon
      of an aristocracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, conversation settled on politics. Randal listened with
      attention, and in silence, till Egerton drew him gently out; just enough,
      and no more,&mdash;just enough to make his intelligence evident, and
      without subjecting him to the charge of laying down the law. Egerton knew
      how to draw out young men,&mdash;a difficult art. It was one reason why he
      was so peculiarly popular with the more rising members of his party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party broke up early.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are in time for Almack's," said Egerton, glancing at the clock, "and I
      have a voucher for you; come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal followed his patron into the carriage. By the way Egerton thus
      addressed him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall introduce you to the principal leaders of society; know them and
      study them: I do not advise you to attempt to do more,&mdash;that is, to
      attempt to become the fashion. It is a very expensive ambition: some men
      it helps, most men it ruins. On the whole, you have better cards in your
      hands. Dance or not as it pleases you; don't flirt. If you flirt people
      will inquire into your fortune,&mdash;an inquiry that will do you little
      good; and flirting entangles a young man into marrying. That would never
      do. Here we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      In two minutes more they were in the great ballroom, and Randal's eyes
      were dazzled with the lights, the diamonds, the blaze of beauty. Audley
      presented him in quick succession to some dozen ladies, and then
      disappeared amidst the crowd. Randal was not at a loss: he was without
      shyness; or if he had that disabling infirmity, he concealed it. He
      answered the languid questions put to him with a certain spirit that kept
      up talk, and left a favourable impression of his agreeable qualities. But
      the lady with whom he got on the best was one who had no daughters out, a
      handsome and witty woman of the world,&mdash;Lady Frederick Coniers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is your first ball at Almack's then, Mr. Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have not secured a partner? Shall I find you one? What do you
      think of that pretty girl in pink?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see her&mdash;but I cannot think of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are rather, perhaps, like a diplomatist in a new court, and your
      first object is to know who is who."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess that on beginning to study the history of my own day I should
      like to distinguish the portraits that illustrate the memoir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your arm, then, and we will come into the next room. We shall see
      the different notabilites enter one by one, and observe without being
      observed. This is the least I can do for a friend of Mr. Egerton's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Egerton, then," said Randal,&mdash;as they threaded their way through
      the space without the rope that protected the dancers,&mdash;"Mr. Egerton
      has had the good fortune to win your esteem even for his friends, however
      obscure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to say truth, I think no one whom Mr. Egerton calls his friend need
      long remain obscure, if he has the ambition to be otherwise; for Mr.
      Egerton holds it a maxim never to forget a friend nor a service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, indeed!" said Randal, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And therefore," continued Lady Frederick, "as he passes through life,
      friends gather round him. He will rise even higher yet. Gratitude, Mr.
      Leslie, is a very good policy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hem," muttered Mr. Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now gained the room where tea and bread and butter were the
      homely refreshments to the habitues of what at that day was the most
      exclusive assembly in London. They ensconced themselves in a corner by a
      window, and Lady Frederick performed her task of cicerone with lively
      ease, accompanying each notice of the various persons who passed
      panoramically before them with sketch and anecdote, sometimes
      good-natured, generally satirical, always graphic and amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by Frank Hazeldean, having on his arm a young lady of haughty air
      and with high though delicate features, came to the tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last new Guardsman," said Lady Frederick; "very handsome, and not yet
      quite spoiled. But he has got into a dangerous set."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"The young lady with him is handsome enough to be
      dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY FREDERICK (laughing).&mdash;"No danger for him there,&mdash;as yet at
      least. Lady Mary (the Duke of Knaresborough's daughter) is only in her
      second year. The first year, nothing under an earl; the second, nothing
      under a baron. It will be full four years before she comes down to a
      commoner. Mr. Hazeldean's danger is of another kind. He lives much with
      men who are not exactly mauvais ton, but certainly not of the best taste.
      Yet he is very young; he may extricate himself,&mdash;leaving half his
      fortune behind him. What, he nods to you! You know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; he is nephew to Mr. Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! I did not know that. Hazeldean is a new name in London. I heard
      his father was a plain country gentleman, of good fortune, but not that he
      was related to Mr. Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half-brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will Mr. Egerton pay the young gentleman's debts? He has no sons
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Mr. Egerton's fortune comes from his wife, from my family,&mdash;from
      a Leslie, not from a Hazeldean." Lady Frederick turned sharply, looked at
      Randal's countenance with more attention than she had yet vouchsafed to
      it, and tried to talk of the Leslies. Randal was very short there.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterwards, Randal, who had not danced, was still in the
      refreshment-room, but Lady Frederick had long quitted him. He was talking
      with some old Etonians who had recognized him, when there entered a lady
      of very remarkable appearance, and a murmur passed through the room as she
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might be three or four and twenty. She was dressed in black velvet,
      which contrasted with the alabaster whiteness of her throat and the clear
      paleness of her complexion, while it set off the diamonds with which she
      was profusely covered. Her hair was of the deepest jet, and worn simply
      braided. Her eyes, too, were dark and brilliant, her features regular and
      striking; but their expression, when in repose, was not prepossessing to
      such as love modesty and softness in the looks of woman. But when she
      spoke and smiled, there was so much spirit and vivacity in the
      countenance, so much fascination in the smile, that all which might before
      have marred the effect of her beauty strangely and suddenly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that very handsome woman?" asked Randal. "An Italian,&mdash;a
      Marchesa something," said one of the Etonians.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Di Negra," suggested another, who had been abroad: "she is a widow; her
      husband was of the great Genoese family of Negra,&mdash;a younger branch
      of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Several men now gathered thickly around the fair Italian. A few ladies of
      the highest rank spoke to her, but with a more distant courtesy than
      ladies of high rank usually show to foreigners of such quality as Madame
      di Negra. Ladies of rank less elevated seemed rather shy of her,&mdash;that
      might be from jealousy. As Randal gazed at the marchesa with more
      admiration than any woman, perhaps, had before excited in him, he heard a
      voice near him say,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Madame di Negra is resolved to settle amongst us, and marry an
      Englishman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she can find one sufficiently courageous," returned a female voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she's trying hard for Egerton, and he has courage enough for
      anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      The female voice replied, with a laugh, "Mr Egerton knows the world too
      well, and has resisted too many temptations to be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! there he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton came into the room with his usual firm step and erect mien. Randal
      observed that a quick glance was exchanged between him and the marchesa;
      but the minister passed her by with a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Randal watched, and, ten minutes afterwards, Egerton and the
      marchesa were seated apart in the very same convenient nook that Randal
      and Lady Frederick had occupied an hour or so before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this the reason why Mr. Egerton so insultingly warns me against
      counting on his fortune?" muttered Randal. "Does he mean to marry again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Unjust suspicion!&mdash;for, at that moment, these were the words that
      Audley Egerton was dropping forth from his lips of bronze,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, dear madam, do not ascribe to my frank admiration more gallantry
      than it merits. Your conversation charms me, your beauty delights me; your
      society is as a holiday that I look forward to in the fatigues of my life.
      But I have done with love, and I shall never marry again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You almost pique me into trying to win, in order to reject you," said the
      Italian, with a flash from her bright eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I defy even you," answered Audley, with his cold hard smile. "But to
      return to the point. You have more influence, at least, over this subtle
      ambassador; and the secret we speak of I rely on you to obtain me. Ah,
      Madam, let us rest friends. You see I have conquered the unjust prejudices
      against you; you are received and feted everywhere, as becomes your birth
      and your attractions. Rely on me ever, as I on you. But I shall excite too
      much envy if I stay here longer, and am vain enough to think that I may
      injure you if I provoke the gossip of the ill-natured. As the avowed
      friend, I can serve you; as the supposed lover, No&mdash;" Audley rose as
      he said this, and, standing by the chair, added carelessly, "&mdash;propos,
      the sum you do me the honour to borrow will be paid to your bankers
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand thanks! my brother will hasten to repay you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley bowed. "Your brother, I hope, will repay me in person, not before.
      When does he come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he has again postponed his visit to London; he is so much needed in
      Vienna. But while we are talking of him, allow me to ask if your friend,
      Lord L'Estrange, is indeed still so bitter against that poor brother of
      mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is shameful!" cried the Italian, with warmth; "what has my brother
      ever done to him that he should actually intrigue against the count in his
      own court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Intrigue! I think you wrong Lord L'Estrange; he but represented what he
      believed to be the truth, in defence of a ruined exile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will not tell me where that exile is, or if his daughter still
      lives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear marchesa, I have called you friend, therefore I will not aid
      L'Estrange to injure you or yours. But I call L'Estrange a friend also;
      and I cannot violate the trust that&mdash;" Audley stopped short, and bit
      his lip. "You understand me," he resumed, with a more genial smile than
      usual; and he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian's brows met as her eye followed him; then, as she too rose,
      that eye encountered Randal's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That young man has the eye of an Italian," said the marchesa to herself,
      as she passed by him into the ballroom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard and Helen settled themselves in two little chambers in a small
      lane. The neighbourhood was dull enough, the accommodation humble; but
      their landlady had a smile. That was the reason, perhaps, why Helen chose
      the lodgings: a smile is not always found on the face of a landlady when
      the lodger is poor. And out of their windows they caught sight of a green
      tree, an elm, that grew up fair and tall in a carpenter's yard at the
      rear. That tree was like another smile to the place. They saw the birds
      come and go to its shelter; and they even heard, when a breeze arose, the
      pleasant murmur of its boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard went the same evening to Captain Digby's old lodgings, but he
      could learn there no intelligence of friends or protectors for Helen. The
      people were rude and surly, and said that the captain still owed them L1
      17s. The claim, however, seemed very disputable, and was stoutly denied by
      Helen. The next morning Leonard set out in search of Dr. Morgan. He
      thought his best plan was to inquire the address of the doctor at the
      nearest chemist's, and the chemist civilly looked into the "Court Guide,"
      and referred him to a house in Bulstrode Street, Manchester Square. To
      this street Leonard contrived to find his way, much marvelling at the
      meanness of London: Screwstown seemed to him the handsomer town of the
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shabby man-servant opened the door, and Leonard remarked that the narrow
      passage was choked with boxes, trunks, and various articles of furniture.
      He was shown into a small room containing a very large round table,
      whereon were sundry works on homoeopathy, Parry's "Cymbrian Plutarch,"
      Davies's "Celtic Researches," and a Sunday news paper. An engraved
      portrait of the illustrious Hahnemann occupied the place of honour over
      the chimneypiece. In a few minutes the door to an inner room opened, and
      Dr. Morgan appeared, and said politely, "Come in, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor seated himself at a desk, looked hastily at Leonard, and then
      at a great chronometer lying on the table. "My time's short, sir,&mdash;going
      abroad: and now that I am going, patients flock to me. Too late. London
      will repent its apathy. Let it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor paused majestically, and not remarking on Leonard's face the
      consternation he had anticipated, he repeated peevishly, "I am going
      abroad, sir, but I will make a synopsis of your case, and leave it to my
      successor. Hum!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hair chestnut; eyes&mdash;what colour? Look this way,&mdash;blue, dark
      blue. Hem! Constitution nervous. What are the symptoms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," began Leonard, "a little girl&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN (impatiently).&mdash;"Little girl; never mind the history of
      your sufferings; stick to the symptoms,&mdash;stick to the symptoms."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"YOU mistake me, Doctor, I have nothing the matter with me.
      A little girl&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN.&mdash;"Girl again! I understand! it is she who is ill. Shall I
      go to her? She must describe her own symptoms,&mdash;I can't judge from
      your talk. You'll be telling me she has consumption, or dyspepsia, or some
      such disease that don't exist: mere allopathic inventions,&mdash;symptoms,
      sir, symptoms."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (forcing his way).&mdash;"You attended her poor father, Captain
      Digby, when he was taken ill in the coach with you. He is dead, and his
      child is an orphan."
    </p>
    <p>
      DR. MORGAN (fumbling in his medical pocket-book).&mdash;"Orphan! nothing
      for orphans, especially if inconsolable, like aconite and chamomilla."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [It may be necessary to observe that homoeopathy professes to deal
   with our moral affections as well as with our physical maladies, and
   has a globule for every sorrow.]
</pre>
    <p>
      With some difficulty Leonard succeeded in bringing Helen to the
      recollection of the homoeopathist, stating how he came in charge of her,
      and why he sought Dr. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was much moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, really," said he, after a pause, "I don't see how I can help the
      poor child. I know nothing of her relations. This Lord Les&mdash;whatever
      his name is&mdash;I know of no lords in London. I knew lords, and
      physicked them too, when I was a blundering allopathist. There was the
      Earl of Lansmere,&mdash;has had many a blue pill from me, sinner that I
      was. His son was wiser; never would take physic. Very clever boy was Lord
      L'Estrange&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange! that name begins with Les&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff! He's always abroad,&mdash;shows his sense. I'm going abroad too.
      No development for science in this horrid city,&mdash;full of prejudices,
      sir, and given up to the most barbarous allopathical and phlebotomical
      propensities. I am going to the land of Hahnemann, sir,&mdash;sold my
      good-will, lease, and furniture, and have bought in on the Rhine. Natural
      life there, sir,&mdash;homeeopathy needs nature: dine at one o'clock, get
      up at four, tea little known, and science appreciated. But I forget. Cott!
      what can I do for the orphan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," said Leonard, rising, "Heaven will give me strength to
      support her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked at the young man attentively. "And yet," said he, in a
      gentler voice, "you, young man, are, by your account, a perfect stranger
      to her, or were so when you undertook to bring her to London. You have a
      good heart, always keep it. Very healthy thing, sir, a good heart,&mdash;that
      is, when not carried to excess. But you have friends of your own in town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"Not yet, sir; I hope to make them."
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR.&mdash;"Pless me, you do? How?&mdash;I can't make any."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard coloured and hung his head. He longed to say, "Authors find
      friends in their readers,&mdash;I am going to be an author." But he felt
      that the reply would savour of presumption, and held his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor continued to examine him, and with friendly interest. "You say
      you walked up to London: was that from choice or economy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"Both, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR.&mdash;"Sit down again, and let us talk. I can give you a quarter
      of an hour, and I'll see if I can help either of you, provided you tell me
      all the symptoms,&mdash;I mean all the particulars."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with that peculiar adroitness which belongs to experience in the
      medical profession, Dr. Morgan, who was really an acute and able man,
      proceeded to put his questions, and soon extracted from Leonard the boy's
      history and hopes. But when the doctor, in admiration at a simplicity
      which contrasted so evident an intelligence, finally asked him his name
      and connections, and Leonard told them, the homoeopathist actually
      started. "Leonard Fairfield, grandson of my old friend, John Avenel of
      Lansmere! I must shake you by the hand. Brought up by Mrs. Fairfield!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, now I look, strong family likeness,&mdash;very strong"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears stood in the doctor's eyes. "Poor Nora!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora! Did you know my aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your aunt! Ah! ah! yes, yes! Poor Nora! she died almost in these arms,&mdash;so
      young, so beautiful. I remember it as if yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor brushed his hand across his eyes, and swallowed a globule; and
      before the boy knew what he was about, had, in his benevolence, thrust
      another between Leonard's quivering lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock was heard at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! that 's my great patient," cried the doctor, recovering his
      self-possession,&mdash;"must see him. A chronic case, excellent patient,&mdash;tic,
      sir, tic. Puzzling and interesting. If I could take that tic with me, I
      should ask nothing more from Heaven. Call again on Monday; I may have
      something to tell you then as to yourself. The little girl can't stay with
      you,&mdash;wrong and nonsensical! I will see after her. Leave me your
      address,&mdash;write it here. I think I know a lady who will take charge
      of her. Good-by. Monday next, ten o'clock." With this, the doctor thrust
      out Leonard, and ushered in his grand patient, whom he was very anxious to
      take with him to the banks of the Rhine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard had now only to discover the nobleman whose name had been so
      vaguely uttered by poor Captain Digby. He had again recourse to the "Court
      Guide;" and finding the address of two or three lords the first syllable
      of whose titles seemed similar to that repeated to him, and all living
      pretty near to each other, in the regions of Mayfair, he ascertained his
      way to that quarter, and, exercising his mother-wit, inquired at the
      neighbouring shops as to the personal appearance of these noblemen. Out of
      consideration for his rusticity, he got very civil and clear answers; but
      none of the lords in question corresponded with the description given by
      Helen. One was old, another was exceedingly corpulent, a third was
      bedridden,&mdash;none of them was known to keep a great dog. It is
      needless to say that the name of L'Estrange (no habitant of London) was
      not in the "Court Guide." And Dr. Morgan's assertion that that person was
      always abroad unluckily dismissed from Leonard's mind the name the
      homoeopathist had so casually mentioned. But Helen was not disappointed
      when her young protector returned late in the day, and told her of his
      ill-success. Poor child! she was so pleased in her heart not to be
      separated from her new brother; and Leonard was touched to see how she had
      contrived, in his absence, to give a certain comfort and cheerful grace to
      the bare room devoted to himself. She had arranged his few books and
      papers so neatly, near the window, in sight of the one green elm. She had
      coaxed the smiling landlady out of one or two extra articles of furniture,
      especially a walnut-tree bureau, and some odds and ends of ribbon, with
      which last she had looped up the curtains. Even the old rush-bottom chairs
      had a strange air of elegance, from the mode in which they were placed.
      The fairies had given sweet Helen the art that adorns a home, and brings
      out a smile from the dingiest corner of hut and attic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard wondered and praised. He kissed his blushing ministrant
      gratefully, and they sat down in joy to their abstemious meal; when
      suddenly his face was overclouded,&mdash;there shot through him the
      remembrance of Dr. Morgan's words, "The little girl can't stay with you,&mdash;wrong
      and nonsensical. I think I know a lady who will take charge of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," cried Leonard, sorrowfully, "how could I forget?" And he told Helen
      what grieved him. Helen at first exclaimed that she would not go. Leonard,
      rejoiced, then began to talk as usual of his great prospects; and, hastily
      finishing his meal, as if there were no time to lose, sat down at once to
      his papers. Then Helen contemplated him sadly, as he bent over his
      delightful work. And when, lifting his radiant eyes from his manuscripts,
      he exclaimed, "No, no, you shall not go. This must succeed,&mdash;and we
      shall live together in some pretty cottage, where we can see more than one
      tree,"&mdash;then Helen sighed, and did not answer this time, "No, I will
      not go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after she stole from the room, and into her own; and there,
      kneeling down, she prayed, and her prayer was somewhat this, "Guard me
      against my own selfish heart; may I never be a burden to him who has
      shielded me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps as the Creator looks down on this world, whose wondrous beauty
      beams on us more and more, in proportion as our science would take it from
      poetry into law,&mdash;perhaps He beholds nothing so beautiful as the pure
      heart of a simple loving child.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard went out the next day with his precious manuscripts. He had read
      sufficient of modern literature to know the names of the principal London
      publishers; and to these he took his way with a bold step, though a
      beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day he was out longer than the last; and when he returned, and came
      into the little room, Helen uttered a cry, for she scarcely recognized
      him,&mdash;there was on his face so deep, so silent, and so concentrated a
      despondency. He sat down listlessly, and did not kiss her this time, as
      she stole towards him. He felt so humbled. He was a king deposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He take charge of another life! He!
    </p>
    <p>
      She coaxed him at last into communicating his day's chronicle. The reader
      beforehand knows too well what it must be to need detailed repetition.
      Most of the publishers had absolutely refused to look at his manuscripts;
      one or two had good-naturedly glanced over and returned them at once with
      a civil word or two of flat rejection. One publisher alone&mdash;himself a
      man of letters, and who in youth had gone through the same bitter process
      of disillusion that now awaited the village genius&mdash;volunteered some
      kindly though stern explanation and counsel to the unhappy boy. This
      gentleman read a portion of Leonard's principal poem with attention, and
      even with frank admiration. He could appreciate the rare promise that it
      manifested. He sympathized with the boy's history, and even with his
      hopes; and then he said, in bidding him farewell,
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I publish this poem for you, speaking as a trader, I shall be a
      considerable loser. Did I publish all I admire, out of sympathy with the
      author, I should be a ruined man. But suppose that, impressed as I really
      am with the evidence of no common poetic gifts in this manuscript, I
      publish it, not as a trader, but a lover of literature, I shall in
      reality, I fear, render you a great disservice, and perhaps unfit your
      whole life for the exertions on which you must rely for independence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, sir?" cried Leonard. "Not that I would ask you to injure yourself
      for me," he added, with proud tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, my young friend? I will explain. There is enough talent in these
      verses to induce very flattering reviews in some of the literary journals.
      You will read these, find yourself proclaimed a poet, will cry 'I am on
      the road to fame.' You will come to me, 'And my poem, how does it sell?' I
      shall point to some groaning shelf, and say, 'Not twenty copies! The
      journals may praise, but the public will not buy it.' 'But you will have
      got a name,' you say. Yes, a name as a poet just sufficiently known to
      make every man in practical business disinclined to give fair trial to
      your talents in a single department of positive life; none like to employ
      poets;&mdash;a name that will not put a penny in your purse,&mdash;worse
      still, that will operate as a barrier against every escape into the ways
      whereby men get to fortune. But having once tasted praise, you will
      continue to sigh for it: you will perhaps never again get a publisher to
      bring forth a poem, but you will hanker round the purlieus of the Muses,
      scribble for periodicals, fall at last into a bookseller's drudge. Profits
      will be so precarious and uncertain, that to avoid debt may be impossible;
      then, you who now seem so ingenuous and so proud, will sink deeper still
      into the literary mendicant, begging, borrowing&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never! never! never!" cried Leonard, veiling his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such would have been my career," continued the publisher; "but I luckily
      had a rich relative, a trader, whose calling I despised as a boy, who
      kindly forgave my folly, bound me as an apprentice, and here I am; and now
      I can afford to write books as well as sell them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young man, you must have respectable relations,&mdash;go by their advice
      and counsel; cling fast to some positive calling. Be anything in this city
      rather than poet by profession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how, sir, have there ever been poets? Had they other callings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read their biography, and then&mdash;envy them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was silent a moment; but lifting his head, answered loud and
      quickly, "I have read their biography. True, their lot was poverty,&mdash;perhaps
      hunger. Sir, I&mdash;envy them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poverty and hunger are small evils," answered the bookseller, with a
      grave, kind smile. "There are worse,&mdash;debt and degradation, and&mdash;despair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, no, you exaggerate; these last are not the lot of all poets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, for most of our greatest poets had some private means of their
      own. And for others&mdash;why, all who have put into a lottery have not
      drawn blanks. But who could advise another man to set his whole hope of
      fortune on the chance of a prize in a lottery? And such a lottery!"
      groaned the publisher, glancing towards sheets and reams of dead authors,
      lying, like lead, upon his shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard clutched his manuscripts to his heart, and hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he muttered, as Helen clung to him, and tried to console,&mdash;"yes,
      you were right: London is very vast, very strong, and very cruel;" and his
      head sank lower and lower yet upon his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was flung widely open, and in, unannounced, walked Dr. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child turned to him, and at the sight of his face she remembered her
      father; and the tears that for Leonard's sake she had been trying to
      suppress found way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good doctor soon gained all the confidence of these two young hearts;
      and after listening to Leonard's story of his paradise lost in a day, he
      patted him on the shoulder and said, "Well, you will call on me on Monday,
      and we will see. Meanwhile, borrow these of me!"&mdash;and he tried to
      slip three sovereigns into the boy's hand. Leonard was indignant. The
      bookseller's warning flashed on him. Mendicancy! Oh, no, he had not yet
      come to that! He was almost rude and savage in his rejection; and the
      doctor did not like him the less for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an obstinate mule," said the homoeopathist, reluctantly putting
      up his sovereigns. "Will you work at something practical and prosy, and
      let the poetry rest a while?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Leonard, doggedly. "I will work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then. I know an honest bookseller, and he shall give you some
      employment; and meanwhile, at all events, you will be among books, and
      that will be some comfort."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard's eyes brightened. "A great comfort, sir." He pressed the hand he
      had before put aside to his grateful heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," resumed the doctor, seriously, "you really feel a strong
      predisposition to make verses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very bad symptom indeed, and must be stopped before a relapse! Here, I
      have cured three prophets and ten poets with this novel specific."
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus speaking he had got out his book and a globule. "Agaricus
      muscarius dissolved in a tumbler of distilled water,&mdash;teaspoonful
      whenever the fit comes on. Sir, it would have cured Milton himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now for you, my child," turning to Helen, "I have found a lady who
      will be very kind to you. Not a menial situation. She wants some one to
      read to her and tend on her; she is old and has no children. She wants a
      companion, and prefers a girl of your age to one older. Will this suit
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen got close to the doctor's ear, and whispered, "No, I cannot leave
      him now,&mdash;he is so sad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cott!" grunted the doctor, "you two must have been reading 'Paul and
      Virginia.' If I could but stay in England, I would try what ignatia would
      do in this case,&mdash;interesting experiment! Listen to me, little girl,
      and go out of the room, you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, averting his face, obeyed. Helen made an involuntary step after
      him; the doctor detained and drew her on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your Christian name?&mdash;I forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen, listen. In a year or two you will be a young woman, and it would
      be very wrong then to live alone with that young man. Meanwhile you have
      no right to cripple all his energies. He must not have you leaning on his
      right arm,&mdash;you would weigh it down. I am going away, and when I am
      gone there will be no one to help you, if you reject the friend I offer
      you. Do as I tell you, for a little girl so peculiarly susceptible (a
      thorough pulsatilla constitution) cannot be obstinate and egotistical."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see him cared for and happy, sir," said she, firmly, "and I will
      go where you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shall be so; and to-morrow, while he is out, I will come and fetch
      you. Nothing so painful as leave-taking, shakes the nervous system, and is
      a mere waste of the animal economy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen sobbed aloud; then, writhing from the doctor, she exclaimed, "But he
      may know where I am? We may see each other sometimes? Ah, sir, it was at
      my father's grave that we first met, and I think Heaven sent him to me. Do
      not part us forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have a heart of stone if I did," cried the doctor, vehemently;
      "and Miss Starke shall let him come and visit you once a week. I'll give
      her something to make her. She is naturally indifferent to others. I will
      alter her whole constitution, and melt her into sympathy&mdash;with
      rhododendron and arsenic!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before he went the doctor wrote a line to "Mr. Prickett, Bookseller,
      Holborn," and told Leonard to take it the next morning, as addressed. "I
      will call on Prickett myself tonight and prepare him for your visit. But I
      hope and trust you will only have to stay there a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then turned the conversation, to communicate his plans for Helen. Miss
      Starke lived at Highgate,&mdash;a worthy woman, stiff and prim, as old
      maids sometimes are; but just the place for a little girl like Helen, and
      Leonard should certainly be allowed to call and see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard listened and made no opposition,&mdash;now that his day-dream was
      dispelled, he had no right to pretend to be Helen's protector. He could
      have prayed her to share his wealth and his fame; his penury and his
      drudgery&mdash;no.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very sorrowful evening,&mdash;that between the adventurer and the
      child. They sat up late, till their candle had burned down to the socket;
      neither did they talk much; but his hand clasped hers all the time, and
      her head pillowed it self on his shoulder. I fear when they parted it was
      not for sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Leonard went forth the next morning, Helen stood at the street
      door watching him depart&mdash;slowly, slowly. No doubt, in that humble
      lane there were many sad hearts; but no heart so heavy as that of the
      still, quiet child, when the form she had watched was to be seen no more,
      and, still standing on the desolate threshold, she gazed into space, and
      all was vacant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Prickett was a believer in homeeopathy, and declared, to the
      indignation of all the apothecaries round Holborn, that he had been cured
      of a chronic rheumatism by Dr. Morgan. The good doctor had, as he
      promised, seen Mr. Prickett when he left Leonard, and asked him as a
      favour to find some light occupation for the boy, that would serve as an
      excuse for a modest weekly salary. "It will not be for long," said the
      doctor: "his relations are respectable and well off. I will write to his
      grandparents, and in a few days I hope to relieve you of the charge. Of
      course, if you don't want him, I will repay what he costs meanwhile."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prickett, thus prepared for Leonard, received him very graciously;
      and, after a few questions, said Leonard was just the person he wanted to
      assist him in cataloguing his books, and offered him most handsomely L1 a
      week for the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plunged at once into a world of books vaster than he had ever before won
      admission to, that old divine dream of knowledge, out of which poetry had
      sprung, returned to the village student at the very sight of the venerable
      volumes. The collection of Mr. Prickett was, however, in reality by no
      means large; but it comprised not only the ordinary standard works, but
      several curious and rare ones. And Leonard paused in making the catalogue,
      and took many a hasty snatch of the contents of each tome, as it passed
      through his hands. The bookseller, who was an enthusiast for old books,
      was pleased to see a kindred feeling (which his shop-boy had never
      exhibited) in his new assistant; and he talked about rare editions and
      scarce copies, and initiated Leonard into many of the mysteries of the
      bibliographist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more dark and dingy than the shop. There was a booth
      outside, containing cheap books and odd volumes, round which there was
      always an attentive group; within, a gas-lamp burned night and day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But time passed quickly to Leonard. He missed not the green fields, he
      forgot his disappointments, he ceased to remember even Helen. O strange
      passion of knowledge! nothing like thee for strength and devotion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prickett was a bachelor, and asked Leonard to dine with him on a cold
      shoulder of mutton. During dinner the shop-boy kept the shop, and Mr.
      Prickett was really pleasant, as well as loquacious. He took a liking to
      Leonard, and Leonard told him his adventures with the publishers, at which
      Mr. Prickett rubbed his hands and laughed, as at a capital joke. "Oh, give
      up poetry, and stick to a shop," cried he; "and to cure you forever of the
      mad whim to be author, I'll just lend you the 'Life and Works of
      Chatterton.' You may take it home with you and read before you go to bed.
      You'll come back quite a new man to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till night, when the shop was closed, did Leonard return to his
      lodging. And when he entered the room, he was struck to the soul by the
      silence, by the void. Helen was gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rose-tree in its pot on the table at which he wrote, and by it
      a scrap of paper, on which was written,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   DEAR, dear brother Leonard, God bless you. I will let you know when
   we can meet again. Take care of this rose, Brother, and don't
   forget poor

   HELEN.
</pre>
    <p>
      Over the word "forget" there was a big round blistered spot that nearly
      effaced the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard leaned his face on his hands, and for the first time in his life
      he felt what solitude really is. He could not stay long in the room. He
      walked out again, and wandered objectless to and fro the streets. He
      passed that stiller and humbler neighbourhood, he mixed with the throng
      that swarmed in the more populous thoroughfares. Hundreds and thousands
      passed him by, and still&mdash;still such solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back, lighted his candle, and resolutely drew forth the
      "Chatterton" which the bookseller had lent him. It was an old edition, in
      one thick volume. It had evidently belonged to some contemporary of the
      poet's,&mdash;apparently an inhabitant of Bristol,&mdash;some one who had
      gathered up many anecdotes respecting Chatterton's habits, and who
      appeared even to have seen him, nay, been in his company; for the book was
      interleaved, and the leaves covered with notes and remarks, in a stiff
      clear hand,&mdash;all evincing personal knowledge of the mournful immortal
      dead. At first, Leonard read with an effort; then the strange and fierce
      spell of that dread life seized upon him,&mdash;seized with pain and gloom
      and terror,&mdash;this boy dying by his own hand, about the age Leonard
      had attained himself. This wondrous boy, of a genius beyond all comparison
      the greatest that ever yet was developed and extinguished at the age of
      eighteen,&mdash;self-taught, self-struggling, self-immolated. Nothing in
      literature like that life and that death!
    </p>
    <p>
      With intense interest Leonard perused the tale of the brilliant imposture,
      which had been so harshly and so absurdly construed into the crime of a
      forgery, and which was (if not wholly innocent) so akin to the literary
      devices always in other cases viewed with indulgence, and exhibiting, in
      this, intellectual qualities in themselves so amazing,&mdash;such
      patience, such forethought, such labour, such courage, such ingenuity,&mdash;the
      qualities that, well directed, make men great, not only in books, but
      action. And, turning from the history of the imposture to the poems
      themselves, the young reader bent before their beauty, literally awed and
      breathless. How this strange Bristol boy tamed and mastered his rude and
      motley materials into a music that comprehended every tune and key, from
      the simplest to the sublimest! He turned back to the biography; he read
      on; he saw the proud, daring, mournful spirit alone in the Great City,
      like himself. He followed its dismal career, he saw it falling with
      bruised and soiled wings into the mire. He turned again to the later
      works, wrung forth as tasks for bread,&mdash;the satires without moral
      grandeur, the politics without honest faith. He shuddered and sickened as
      he read. True, even here his poet mind appreciated (what perhaps only
      poets can) the divine fire that burned fitfully through that meaner and
      more sordid fuel,&mdash;he still traced in those crude, hasty, bitter
      offerings to dire Necessity the hand of the young giant who had built up
      the stately verse of Rowley. But alas! how different from that "mighty
      line." How all serenity and joy had fled from these later exercises of art
      degraded into journey-work! Then rapidly came on the catastrophe,&mdash;the
      closed doors, the poison, the suicide, the manuscripts torn by the hands
      of despairing wrath, and strewed round the corpse upon the funereal
      floors. It was terrible! The spectre of the Titan boy (as described in the
      notes written on the margin), with his haughty brow, his cynic smile, his
      lustrous eyes, haunted all the night the baffled and solitary child of
      song.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It will often happen that what ought to turn the human mind from some
      peculiar tendency produces the opposite effect. One would think that the
      perusal in the newspaper of some crime and capital punishment would warn
      away all who had ever meditated the crime, or dreaded the chance of
      detection. Yet it is well known to us that many a criminal is made by
      pondering over the fate of some predecessor in guilt. There is a
      fascination in the Dark and Forbidden, which, strange to say, is only lost
      in fiction. No man is more inclined to murder his nephews, or stifle his
      wife, after reading "Richard the Third" or "Othello." It is the reality
      that is necessary to constitute the danger of contagion. Now, it was this
      reality in the fate and life and crowning suicide of Chatterton that
      forced itself upon Leonard's thoughts, and sat there like a visible evil
      thing, gathering evil like cloud around it. There was much in the dead
      poet's character, his trials, and his doom, that stood out to Leonard like
      a bold and colossal shadow of himself and his fate. Alas! the book seller,
      in one respect, had said truly. Leonard came back to him the next day a
      new man; and it seemed even to himself as if he had lost a good angel in
      losing Helen. "Oh, that she had been by my side!" thought he. "Oh, that I
      could have felt the touch of her confiding hand; that, looking up from the
      scathed and dreary ruin of this life, that had sublimely lifted itself
      from the plain, and sought to tower aloft from a deluge, her mild look had
      spoken to me of innocent, humble, unaspiring childhood! Ah! If indeed I
      were still necessary to her,&mdash;still the sole guardian and protector,&mdash;then
      could I say to myself; 'Thou must not despair and die! Thou hast her to
      live and to strive for.' But no, no! Only this vast and terrible London,&mdash;the
      solitude of the dreary garret, and those lustrous eyes, glaring alike
      through the throng and through the solitude."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the following Monday Dr. Morgan's shabby man-servant opened the door to
      a young man in whom he did not at first remember a former visitor. A few
      days before, embrowned with healthful travel, serene light in his eye,
      simple trust on his careless lip, Leonard Fairfield had stood at that
      threshold. Now again he stood there, pale and haggard, with a cheek
      already hollowed into those deep anxious lines that speak of working
      thoughts and sleepless nights; and a settled sullen gloom resting heavily
      on his whole aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I call by appointment," said the boy, testily, as the servant stood
      irresolute. The man gave way. "Master is just gone out to a patient:
      please to wait, sir;" and he showed him into the little parlour. In a few
      moments, two other patients were admitted. These were women, and they
      began talking very loud. They disturbed Leonard's unsocial thoughts. He
      saw that the door into the doctor's receiving-room was half open, and,
      ignorant of the etiquette which holds such penetralia as sacred, he walked
      in to escape from the gossips. He threw himself into the doctor's own
      wellworn chair, and muttered to himself, "Why did he tell me to come? What
      new can he think of for me? And if a favour, should I take it? He has
      given me the means of bread by work: that is all I have a right to ask
      from him, from any man,&mdash;all I should accept."
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus soliloquizing, his eye fell on a letter lying open on the
      table. He started. He recognized the handwriting,&mdash;the same as that
      of the letter which had inclosed. L50 to his mother,&mdash;the letter of
      his grandparents. He saw his own name: he saw something more,&mdash;words
      that made his heart stand still, and his blood seem like ice in his veins.
      As he thus stood aghast, a hand was laid on the letter, and a voice, in an
      angry growl, muttered, "How dare you come into my room, and pe reading my
      letters? Er-r-r!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard placed his own hand on the doctor's firmly, and said, in a fierce
      tone, "This letter relates to me, belongs to me, crushes me. I have seen
      enough to know that. I demand to read all,&mdash;learn all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked round, and seeing the door into the waiting-room still
      open, kicked it to with his foot, and then said, under his breath, "What
      have you read? Tell me the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two lines only, and I am called&mdash;I am called&mdash;" Leonard's frame
      shook from head to foot, and the veins on his forehead swelled like cords.
      He could not complete the sentence. It seemed as if an ocean was rolling
      up through his brain, and roaring in his ears. The doctor saw at a glance
      that there was physical danger in his state, and hastily and soothingly
      answered, "Sit down, sit down; calm yourself; you shall know all,&mdash;read
      all; drink this water;" and he poured into a tumbler of the pure liquid a
      drop or two from a tiny phial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard obeyed mechanically, for he was no longer able to stand. He closed
      his eyes, and for a minute or two life seemed to pass from him; then he
      recovered, and saw the good doctor's gaze fixed on him with great
      compassion. He silently stretched forth his hand towards the letter. "Wait
      a few moments," said the physician, judiciously, "and hear me meanwhile.
      It is very unfortunate you should have seen a letter never meant for your
      eye, and containing allusions to a secret you were never to have known.
      But if I tell you more, will you promise me, on your word of honour, that
      you will hold the confidence sacred from Mrs. Fairfield, the Avenels,&mdash;from
      all? I myself am pledged to conceal a secret, which I can only share with
      you on the same condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing," announced Leonard, indistinctly, and with a bitter
      smile on his lip,&mdash;"nothing, it seems, that I should be proud to
      boast of. Yes, I promise; the letter, the letter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor placed it in Leonard's right hand, and quietly slipped to the
      wrist of the left his forefinger and thumb, as physicians are said to do
      when a victim is stretched on the rack. "Pulse decreasing," he muttered;
      "wonderful thing, aconite!" Meanwhile Leonard read as follows, faults in
      spelling and all:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   DR. MORGAN

   SIR,&mdash;I received your favur duly, and am glad to hear that the pore
   boy is safe and Well. But he has been behaving ill, and ungrateful
   to my good son Richard, who is a credit to the whole Famuly and has
   made himself a Gentleman and Was very kind and good to the boy, not
   knowing who and What he is&mdash;God forbid! I don't want never to see
   him again&mdash;the boy. Pore John was ill and Restless for days
   afterwards. John is a pore cretur now, and has had paralyticks.
   And he Talked of nothing but Nora&mdash;the boy's eyes were so like his
   Mother's. I cannot, cannot see the Child of Shame. He can't cum
   here&mdash;for our Lord's sake, sir, don't ask it&mdash;he can't, so
   Respectable as we've always been!&mdash;and such disgrace! Base
   born! base born! Keep him where he is, bind him prentis, I'll pay
   anything for That. You says, sir, he's clever, and quick at
   learning; so did Parson Dale, and wanted him to go to Collidge and
   make a Figur,&mdash;then all would cum out. It would be my death, sir; I
   could not sleep in my grave, sir. Nora, that we were all so proud
   of. Sinful creturs that we are! Nora's good name that we've saved,
   now gone, gone. And Richard, who is so grand, and who was so fond
   of pore, pore Nora! He would not hold up his Head again. Don't let
   him make a Figur in the world; let him be a tradesman, as we were
   afore him,&mdash;any trade he takes to,&mdash;and not cross us no more while
   he lives. Then I shall pray for him, and wish him happy. And have
   not we had enuff of bringing up children to be above their birth?
   Nora, that I used to say was like the first lady o' the land-oh, but
   we were rightly punished! So now, sir, I leave all to you, and will
   Pay all you want for the boy. And be sure that the secret's kept.
   For we have never heard from the father, and, at leest, no one knows
   that Nora has a living son but I and my daughter Jane, and Parson
   Dale and you&mdash;and you Two are good Gentlemen&mdash;and Jane will keep her
   word, and I am old, and shall be in my grave Soon, but I hope it
   won't be while pore John needs me. What could he do without me?
   And if that got wind, it would kill me straght, sir. Pore John is a
   helpless cretur, God bless him. So no more from your servant in all
   dooty,

               M. AVENEL.

    <p>
      Leonard laid down this letter very calmly, and, except by a slight heaving
      at his breast, and a deathlike whiteness of his lips, the emotions he felt
      were undetected. And it is a proof how much exquisite goodness there was
      in his heart that the first words he spoke were, "Thank Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor did not expect that thanksgiving, and he was so startled that
      he exclaimed, "For what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to pity or excuse in the woman I knew and honoured as a
      mother. I am not her son&mdash;her-" He stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: but don't be hard on your true mother,&mdash;poor Nora!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard staggered, and then burst into a sudden paroxysm of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my own mother! my dead mother! Thou for whom I felt so mysterious a
      love,&mdash;thou from whom I took this poet soul! pardon me, pardon me!
      Hard on thee! Would that thou wert living yet, that I might comfort thee!
      What thou must have suffered!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were sobbed forth in broken gasps from the depth of his heart.
      Then he caught up the letter again, and his thoughts were changed as his
      eyes fell upon the writer's shame and fear, as it were, of his very
      existence. All his native haughtiness returned to him. His crest rose, his
      tears dried. "Tell her," he said, with astern, unfaltering voice, "tell
      Mrs. Avenel that she is obeyed; that I will never seek her roof, never
      cross her path, never disgrace her wealthy son. But tell her, also, that I
      will choose my own way in life,&mdash;that I will not take from her a
      bribe for concealment. Tell her that I am nameless, and will yet make a
      name."
    </p>
    <p>
      A name! Was this but an idle boast, or was it one of those flashes of
      conviction which are never belied, lighting up our future for one lurid
      instant, and then fading into darkness?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not doubt it, my prave poy," said Dr. Morgan, growing exceedingly
      Welsh in his excitement; "and perhaps you may find a father, who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father! who is he, what is he? He lives, then! But he has deserted me,&mdash;he
      must have betrayed her! I need him not. The law gives me no father."
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words were said with a return of bitter anguish: then, in a
      calmer tone, he resumed, "But I should know who he is&mdash;as another one
      whose path I may not cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morgan looked embarrassed, and paused in deliberation. "Nay," said he,
      at length, "as you know so much, it is surely best that you should know
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor then proceeded to detail, with some circumlocution, what we
      will here repeat from his account more succinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora Avenel, while yet very young, left her native village, or rather the
      house of Lady Lansinere, by whom she had been educated and brought up, in
      order to accept the place of companion to a lady in London. One evening
      she suddenly presented herself at her father's house, and at the first
      sight of her mother's face she fell down insensible. She was carried to
      bed. Dr. Morgan (then the chief medical practitioner of the town) was sent
      for. That night Leonard came into the world, and his mother died. She
      never recovered her senses, never spoke intelligibly from the time she
      entered the house. "And never, therefore, named your father," said Dr.
      Morgan. "We knew not who he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how," cried Leonard, fiercely,&mdash;"how have they dared to slander
      this dead mother? How knew they that I&mdash;was&mdash;was&mdash;was not
      the child of wedlock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no wedding-ring on Nora's finger, never any rumour of her
      marriage; her strange and sudden appearance at her father's house; her
      emotions on entrance, so unlike those natural to a wife returning to a
      parent's home,&mdash;these are all the evidence against her. But Mrs.
      Avenel deemed them strong, and so did I. You have a right to think we
      judged too harshly,&mdash;perhaps we did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no inquiries were ever made?" said Leonard, mournfully, and after a
      long silence,&mdash;"no inquiries to learn who was the father of the
      motherless child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inquiries! Mrs. Avenel would have died first. Your grandmother's nature
      is very rigid. Had she come from princes, from Cadwallader himself," said
      the Welshman, "she could not more have shrunk from the thought of
      dishonour. Even over her dead child, the child she had loved the best, she
      thought but how to save that child's name and memory from suspicion. There
      was luckily no servant in the house, only Mark Fairfield and his wife
      (Nora's sister): they had arrived the same day on a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Fairfield was nursing her own infant two or three months old; she
      took charge of you; Nora was buried and the secret kept. None out of the
      family knew of it but myself and the curate of the town,&mdash;Mr. Dale.
      The day after your birth, Mrs. Fairfield, to prevent discovery, moved to a
      village at some distance. There her child died; and when she returned to
      Hazeldean, where her husband was settled, you passed as the son she had
      lost. Mark, I know, was as a father to you, for he had loved Nora: they
      had been children together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she came to London,&mdash;London is strong and cruel," muttered
      Leonard. "She was friendless and deceived. I see all,&mdash;I desire to
      know no more. This father&mdash;he must in deed have been like those whom
      I have read of in books. To love, to wrong her,&mdash;that I can conceive;
      but then to leave, to abandon; no visit to her grave, no remorse, no
      search for his own child. Well, well; Mrs. Avenel was right. Let us think
      of him no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man-servant knocked at the door, and then put in his head. "Sir, the
      ladies are getting very impatient, and say they'll go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Leonard, with a strange calm return to the things about him,
      "I ask your pardon for taking up your time so long. I go now. I will never
      mention to my moth&mdash;I mean to Mrs. Fairfield&mdash;what I have
      learned, nor to any one. I will work my way somehow. If Mr. Prickett will
      keep me, I will stay with him at present; but I repeat, I cannot take Mrs.
      Avenel's money and be bound apprentice. Sir, you have been good and
      patient with me,&mdash;Heaven reward you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was too moved to answer. He wrung Leonard's hand, and in
      another minute the door closed upon the nameless boy. He stood alone in
      the streets of London; and the sun flashed on him, red and menacing, like
      the eye of a foe!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard did not appear at the shop of Mr. Prickett that day. Needless it
      is to say where he wandered, what he suffered, what thought, what felt.
      All within was storm. Late at night he returned to his solitary lodging.
      On his table, neglected since the morning, was Helen's rose-tree. It
      looked parched and fading. His heart smote him: he watered the poor plant,&mdash;perhaps
      with his tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Dr. Morgan, after some debate with himself whether or not to
      apprise Mrs. Avenel of Leonard's discovery and message, resolved to spare
      her an uneasiness and alarm that might be dangerous to her health, and
      unnecessary in itself. He replied shortly, that she need not fear
      Leonard's coming to her house; that he was disinclined to bind himself an
      apprentice, but that he was provided for at present; and in a few weeks,
      when Dr. Morgan heard more of him through the tradesman by whom he was
      employed, the doctor would write to her from Germany. He then went to Mr.
      Prickett's, told the willing bookseller to keep the young man for the
      present,&mdash;to be kind to him, watch over his habits and conduct, and
      report to the doctor in his new home, on the Rhine, what avocation he
      thought Leonard would be best suited for, and most inclined to adopt. The
      charitable Welshman divided with the bookseller the salary given to
      Leonard, and left a quarter of his moiety in advance. It is true that he
      knew he should be repaid on applying to Mrs. Avenel; but being a man of
      independent spirit himself, he so sympathized with Leonard's present
      feelings, that he felt as if he should degrade the boy did he maintain
      him, even secretly, out of Mrs. Avenel's money,&mdash;money intended not
      to raise, but keep him down in life. At the worst, it was a sum the doctor
      could afford, and he had brought the boy into the world. Having thus, as
      he thought, safely provided for his two young charges, Helen and Leonard,
      the doctor then gave himself up to his final preparations for departure.
      He left a short note for Leonard with Mr. Prickett, containing some brief
      advice, some kind cheering; a postscript to the effect that he had not
      communicated to Mrs. Avenel the information Leonard had acquired, and that
      it were best to leave her in that ignorance; and six small powders to be
      dissolved in water, and a teaspoonful every fourth hour,&mdash;"Sovereign
      against rage and sombre thoughts," wrote the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the evening of the next day Dr. Morgan, accompanied by his pet patient
      with the chronic tic, whom he had talked into exile, was on the steamboat
      on his way to Ostend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard resumed his life at Mr. Prickett's; but the change in him did not
      escape the bookseller. All his ingenuous simplicity had deserted him. He
      was very distant and very taciturn; he seemed to have grown much older. I
      shall not attempt to analyze metaphysically this change. By the help of
      such words as Leonard may himself occasionally let fall, the reader will
      dive into the boy's heart, and see how there the change had worked, and is
      working still. The happy, dreamy peasant-genius gazing on Glory with
      inebriate, undazzled eyes is no more. It is a man, suddenly cut off from
      the old household holy ties,&mdash;conscious of great powers, and
      confronted on all sides by barriers of iron, alone with hard Reality and
      scornful London; and if he catches a glimpse of the lost Helicon, he sees,
      where he saw the Muse, a pale melancholy spirit veiling its face in shame,&mdash;the
      ghost of the mournful mother, whose child has no name, not even the
      humblest, among the family of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second evening after Dr. Morgan's departure, as Leonard was just
      about to leave the shop, a customer stepped in with a book in his hand,
      which he had snatched from the shop-boy, who was removing the volumes for
      the night from the booth without.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Prickett, Mr. Prickett!" said the customer, "I am ashamed of you. You
      presume to put upon this work, in two volumes, the sum of eight
      shillings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prickett stepped forth from the Cimmerian gloom of some recess, and
      cried, "What! Mr. Burley, is that you? But for your voice, I should not
      have known you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man is like a book, Mr. Prickett; the commonalty only look to his
      binding. I am better bound, it is very true." Leonard glanced towards the
      speaker, who now stood under the gas-lamp, and thought he recognized his
      face. He looked again. Yes; it was the perch-fisher whom he had met on the
      banks of the Brent, and who had warned him of the lost fish and the broken
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. BURLEY (continuing).&mdash;"But the 'Art of Thinking'!&mdash;you
      charge eight shillings for the 'Art of Thinking.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. PRICKETT.&mdash;"Cheap enough, Mr. Burley. A very clean copy."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. BURLEY.&mdash;"Usurer! I sold it to you for three shillings. It is
      more than one hundred and fifty per cent you propose to gain from my 'Art
      of Thinking.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. PRICKETT (stuttering and taken aback).&mdash;"You sold it to me! Ah,
      now I remember. But it was more than three shillings I gave. You forget,&mdash;two
      glasses of brandy-and-water."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. BURLEY.&mdash;"Hospitality, sir, is not to be priced. If you sell your
      hospitality, you are not worthy to possess my 'Art of Thinking.' I resume
      it. There are three shillings, and a shilling more for interest. No; on
      second thoughts, instead of that shilling, I will return your hospitality:
      and the first time you come my way you shall have two glasses of
      brandy-and-water."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prickett did not look pleased, but he made no objection; and Mr.
      Burley put the book into his pocket, and turned to examine the shelves. He
      bought an old jest-book, a stray volume of the Comedies of Destouches,
      paid for them, put them also into his pocket, and was sauntering out, when
      he perceived Leonard, who was now standing at the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hem! who is that?" he asked, whispering Mr. Prickett. "A young assistant
      of mine, and very clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burley scanned Leonard from top to toe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have met before, sir. But you look as if you had returned to the
      Brent, and been fishing for my perch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly, sir," answered Leonard. "But my line is tough, and is not yet
      broken, though the fish drags it amongst the weeds, and buries itself in
      the mud."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hat, bowed slightly, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is clever," said Mr. Burley to the bookseller: "he understands
      allegory."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. PRICKETT.&mdash;"Poor youth! He came to town with the idea of turning
      author: you know what that is, Mr. Burley."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. BURLEY (with an air of superb dignity).&mdash;"Bibliopole, yes! An
      author is a being between gods and men, who ought to be lodged in a
      palace, and entertained at the public charge upon ortolans and Tokay. He
      should be kept lapped in down, and curtained with silken awnings from the
      cares of life, have nothing to do but to write books upon tables of cedar,
      and fish for perch from a gilded galley. And that 's what will come to
      pass when the ages lose their barbarism and know their benefactors.
      Meanwhile, sir, I invite you to my rooms, and will regale you upon
      brandy-and-water as long as I can pay for it; and when I cannot&mdash;you
      shall regale me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prickett muttered, "A very bad bargain indeed," as Mr. Burley, with
      his chin in the air, stepped into the street.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At first Leonard had always returned home through the crowded
      thoroughfares,&mdash;the contact of numbers had animated his spirits. But
      the last two days, since the discovery of his birth, he had taken his way
      down the comparatively unpeopled path of the New Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just gained that part of this outskirt in which the statuaries and
      tomb-makers exhibit their gloomy wares, furniture alike for gardens and
      for graves,&mdash;and, pausing, contemplated a column, on which was placed
      an urn, half covered with a funeral mantle, when his shoulder was lightly
      tapped, and, turning quickly, he saw Mr. Burley standing behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, sir, but you understand perch-fishing; and since we find
      ourselves on the same road, I should like to be better acquainted with
      you. I hear you once wished to be an author. I am one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard had never before, to his knowledge, seen an author, and a mournful
      smile passed his lips as he surveyed the perch-fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burley was indeed very differently attired since the first interview
      by the brooklet. He looked much less like an author,&mdash;but more
      perhaps like a perch-fisher. He had a new white hat, stuck on one side of
      his head, a new green overcoat, new gray trousers, and new boots. In his
      hand was a whalebone stick, with a silver handle. Nothing could be more
      vagrant, devil-me-Garish, and, to use a slang word, tigerish, than his
      whole air. Yet, vulgar as was his costume, he did not himself seem vulgar,
      but rather eccentric, lawless,&mdash;something out of the pale of
      convention. His face looked more pale and more puffed than before, the tip
      of his nose redder; but the spark in his eye was of a livelier light, and
      there was self-enjoyment in the corners of his sensual, humorous lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an author, sir," repeated Leonard. "Well; and what is your report
      of the calling? Yonder column props an urn. The column is tall, and the
      urn is graceful. But it looks out of place by the roadside: what say you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. BURLEY.&mdash;"It would look better in the churchyard."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"So I was thinking. And you are an author!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. BURLEY.&mdash;"Ah, I said you had a quick sense of allegory. And so
      you think an author looks better in a churchyard, when you see him but as
      a muffled urn under the moonshine, than standing beneath the gas-lamp in a
      white hat, and with a red tip to his nose. Abstractedly, you are right.
      But, with your leave, the author would rather be where he is. Let us walk
      on." The two men felt an interest in each other, and they walked some
      yards in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To return to the urn," said Mr. Burley,&mdash;"you think of fame and
      churchyards. Natural enough, before illusion dies; but I think of the
      moment, of existence,&mdash;and I laugh at fame. Fame, sir&mdash;not worth
      a glass of cold-without! And as for a glass of warm, with sugar&mdash;and
      five shillings in one's pocket to spend as one pleases&mdash;what is there
      in Westminster Abbey to compare with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talk on, sir,&mdash;I should like to hear you talk. Let me listen and
      hold my tongue." Leonard pulled his hat over his brows, and gave up his
      moody, questioning, turbulent mind to his new acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And John Burley talked on. A dangerous and fascinating talk it was,&mdash;the
      talk of a great intellect fallen; a serpent trailing its length on the
      ground, and showing bright, shifting, glorious hues, as it grovelled,&mdash;a
      serpent, yet without the serpent's guile. If John Burley deceived and
      tempted, he meant it not,&mdash;he crawled and glittered alike honestly.
      No dove could be more simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughing at fame, he yet dwelt with an eloquent enthusiasm on the joy of
      composition. "What do I care what men without are to say and think of the
      words that gush forth on my page?" cried he. "If you think of the public,
      of urns, and laurels, while you write, you are no genius; you are not fit
      to be an author. I write because it rejoices me, because it is my nature.
      Written, I care no more what becomes of it than the lark for the effect
      that the song has on the peasant it wakes to the plough. The poet, like
      the lark, sings 'from his watch-tower in the skies.' Is this true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, very true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can rob us of this joy? The bookseller will not buy; the public will
      not read. Let them sleep at the foot of the ladder of the angels,&mdash;we
      climb it all the same. And then one settles down into such good-tempered
      Lucianic contempt for men. One wants so little from them, when one knows
      what one's self is worth, and what they are. They are just worth the coin
      one can extract from them, in order to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our life&mdash;that is worth so much to us. And then their joys, so
      vulgar to them, we can make them golden and kingly. Do you suppose Burns
      drinking at the alehouse, with his boors around him, was drinking, like
      them, only beer and whiskey? No, he was drinking nectar; he was imbibing
      his own ambrosial thoughts,&mdash;shaking with the laughter of the gods.
      The coarse human liquid was just needed to unlock his spirit from the
      clay,&mdash;take it from jerkin and corduroys, and wrap it in the 'singing
      robes' that floated wide in the skies: the beer or the whiskey needed but
      for that, and then it changed at once into the drink of Hebe. But come,
      you have not known this life,&mdash;you have not seen it. Come, give me
      this night. I have moneys about me,&mdash;I will fling them abroad as
      liberally as Alexander himself, when he left to his share but hope. Come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whither?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To my throne. On that throne last sat Edmund Kean, mighty mime! I am his
      successor. We will see whether in truth these wild sons of genius, who are
      cited but 'to point a moral and adorn a tale,' were objects of compassion.
      Sober-suited tits to lament over a Savage or a Morland, a Porson and a
      Burns!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or a Chatterton," said Leonard, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chatterton was an impostor in all things; he feigned excesses that he
      never knew. He a bacchanalian, a royster! HE! No. We will talk of him.
      Come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard went.

      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Room! And the smoke-reek, and the gas glare of it! The whitewash of
      the walls, and the prints thereon of the actors in their mime-robes, and
      stage postures,&mdash;actors as far back as their own lost Augustan era,
      when the stage was a real living influence on the manners and the age!
      There was Betterton, in wig and gown,&mdash;as Cato, moralizing on the
      soul's eternity, and halting between Plato and the dagger. There was
      Woodward as "The Fine Gentleman," with the inimitable rake-hell in which
      the heroes of Wycherly and Congreve and Farquhar live again. There was
      jovial Quin as Falstaff, with round buckler and "fair round belly." There
      was Colley Cibber in brocade, taking snuff as with "his Lord," the thumb
      and forefinger raised in air, and looking at you for applause. There was
      Macklin as Shylock, with knife in hand: and Kemble in the solemn weeds of
      the Dane; and Kean in the place of honour over the chimneypiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we are suddenly taken from practical life, with its real workday men,
      and presented to the portraits of those sole heroes of a world Fantastic
      and Phantasmal, in the garments wherein they did "strut and fret their
      hour upon the stage," verily there is something in the sight that moves an
      inner sense within ourselves,&mdash;for all of us have an inner sense of
      some existence, apart from the one that wears away our days: an existence
      that, afar from St. James's and St. Giles's, the Law Courts and Exchange,
      goes its way in terror or mirth, in smiles or in tears, through a vague
      magic-land of the poets. There, see those actors&mdash;they are the men
      who lived it&mdash;to whom our world was the false one, to whom the
      Imaginary was the Actual! And did Shakspeare himself, in his life, ever
      hearken to such applause as thundered round the personators of his airy
      images? Vague children of the most transient of the arts, fleet shadows on
      running waters, though thrown down from the steadfast stars, were ye not
      happier than we who live in the Real? How strange you must feel in the
      great circuit that ye now take through eternity! No prompt-books, no
      lamps, no acting Congreve and Shakspeare there! For what parts in the
      skies have your studies on the earth fitted you? Your ultimate destinies
      are very puzzling. Hail to your effigies, and pass we on!
    </p>
    <p>
      There, too, on the whitewashed walls, were admitted the portraits of ruder
      rivals in the arena of fame,&mdash;yet they, too, had known an applause
      warmer than his age gave to Shakspeare; the Champions of the Ring,&mdash;Cribb
      and Molyneux and Dutch Sam. Interspersed with these was an old print of
      Newmarket in the early part of the last century, and sundry engravings
      from Hogarth. But poets, oh, they were there too! poets who might be
      supposed to have been sufficiently good fellows to be at home with such
      companions,&mdash;Shakspeare, of course, with his placid forehead; Ben
      Jonson, with his heavy scowl; Burns and Byron cheek by jowl. But the
      strangest of all these heterogeneous specimens of graphic art was a
      full-length print of William Pitt!&mdash;William Pitt, the austere and
      imperious. What the deuce did he do there amongst prize-fighters and
      actors and poets? It seemed an insult to his grand memory. Nevertheless
      there he was, very erect, and with a look of ineffable disgust in his
      upturned nostrils. The portraits on the sordid walls were very like the
      crambo in the minds of ordinary men,&mdash;very like the motley pictures
      of the FAMOUS hung up in your parlour, O my Public! Actors and
      prize-fighters, poets and statesmen, all without congruity and fitness,
      all whom you have been to see or to hear for a moment, and whose names
      have stared out in your newspapers, O my public!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the company? Indescribable! Comedians, from small theatres, out of
      employ; pale, haggard-looking boys, probably the sons of worthy traders,
      trying their best to break their fathers' hearts; here and there the
      marked features of a Jew. Now and then you might see the curious puzzled
      face of some greenhorn about town, or perhaps a Cantab; and men of grave
      age, and grayhaired, were there, and amongst them a wondrous proportion of
      carbuncled faces and bottle-noses. And when John Burley entered, there was
      a shout that made William Pitt shake in his frame. Such stamping and
      hallooing, and such hurrahs for "Burley John." And the gentleman who had
      filled the great high leathern chair in his absence gave it up to John
      Burley; and Leonard, with his grave, observant eye, and lip half sad and
      half scornful, placed himself by the side of his introducer. There was a
      nameless, expectant stir through the assembly, as there is in the pit of
      the opera when some great singer advances to the lamps, and begins, "Di
      tanti palpiti." Time flies. Look at the Dutch clock over the door.
      Half-an-hour. John Burley begins to warm. A yet quicker light begins to
      break from his Eye; his voice has a mellow luscious roll in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be grand to-night," whispered a thin man, who looked like a
      tailor, seated on the other side of Leonard. Time flies,&mdash;an hour.
      Look again at the Dutch clock. John Burley is grand, he is in his zenith,
      at his culminating point. What magnificent drollery! what luxuriant
      humour! How the Rabelais shakes in his easy-chair! Under the rush and the
      roar of this fun (what word else shall describe it?) the man's intellect
      is as clear as gold sand under a river. Such wit and such truth, and, at
      times, such a flood of quick eloquence! All now are listeners,&mdash;silent,
      save in applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Leonard listened too. Not, as he would some nights ago, in innocent
      unquestioning delight. No; his mind has passed through great sorrow, great
      passion, and it comes out unsettled, inquiring, eager, brooding over joy
      itself as over a problem. And the drink circulates, and faces change; and
      there are gabbling and babbling; and Burley's head sinks in his bosom, and
      he is silent. And up starts a wild, dissolute, bacchanalian glee for seven
      voices. And the smoke-reek grows denser and thicker, and the gaslight
      looks dizzy through the haze. And John Burley's eyes reel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look again at the Dutch clock. Two hours have gone. John Burley has broken
      out again from his silence, his voice thick and husky, and his laugh
      cracked; and he talks, O ye gods! such rubbish and ribaldry; and the
      listeners roar aloud, and think it finer than before. And Leonard, who had
      hitherto been measuring himself in his mind against the giant, and saying
      inly, "He soars out of my reach," finds the giant shrink smaller and
      smaller, and saith to himself, "He is but of man's common standard after
      all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Look again at the Dutch clock. Three hours have passed. Is John Burley now
      of man's common standard? Man himself seems to have vanished from the
      scene,&mdash;his soul stolen from him, his form gone away with the fumes
      of the smoke, and the nauseous steam from that fiery bowl. And Leonard
      looked round, and saw but the swine of Circe,&mdash;some on the floor,
      some staggering against the walls, some hugging each other on the tables,
      some fighting, some bawling, some weeping. The divine spark had fled from
      the human face; the Beast is everywhere growing more and more out of the
      thing that had been Man. And John Burley, still unconquered, but clean
      lost to his senses, fancies himself a preacher, and drawls forth the most
      lugubrious sermon upon the brevity of life that mortal ever beard,
      accompanied with unctuous sobs; and now and then in the midst of
      balderdash gleams out a gorgeous sentence, that Jeremy Taylor might have
      envied, drivelling away again into a cadence below the rhetoric of a
      Muggletonian. And the waiters choked up the doorway, listening and
      laughing, and prepared to call cabs and coaches; and suddenly some one
      turned off the gaslight, and all was dark as pitch,&mdash;howls and
      laughter, as of the damned, ringing through the Pandemonium. Out from the
      black atmosphere stepped the boy-poet; and the still stars rushed on his
      sight, as they looked over the grimy roof-tops.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well, Leonard, this is the first time thou hast shown that thou hast in
      thee the iron out of which true manhood is forged and shaped. Thou hast
      the power to resist. Forth, unebriate, unpolluted, he came from the orgy,
      as yon star above him came from the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a latch-key to his lodgings. He let himself in and walked
      noiselessly up the creaking wooden stair. It was dawn. He passed on to his
      window and threw it open. The green elm-tree from the carpenter's yard
      looked as fresh and fair as if rooted in solitude, leagues away from the
      smoke of Babylon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nature, Nature!" murmured Leonard, "I hear thy voice now. This stills,
      this strengthens. But the struggle is very dread. Here, despair of life,&mdash;there,
      faith in life. Nature thinks of neither, and lives serenely on."
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by a bird slid softly from the heart of the tree, and dropped on
      the ground below out of sight. But Leonard heard its carol. It awoke its
      companions; wings began to glance in the air, and the clouds grew red
      towards the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard sighed and left the window. On the table, near Helen's rose-tree,
      which he bent over wistfully, lay a letter. He had not observed it before.
      It was in Helen's hand. He took it to the light, and read it by the pure,
      healthful gleams of morn:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   IVY LODGE.

   Oh, my dear brother Leonard, will this find you well, and (more
   happy I dare not say, but) less sad than when we parted? I write
   kneeling, so that it seems to me as if I wrote and prayed at the
   same time. You may come and see me to-morrow evening, Leonard. Do
   come, do,&mdash;we shall walk together in this pretty garden; and there
   is an arbour all covered with jessamine and honeysuckle, from which
   we can look down on London. I have looked from it so many times,&mdash;
   so many&mdash;trying if I can guess the roofs in our poor little street,
   and fancying that I do see the dear elm-tree.

   Miss Starke is very kind to me; and I think after I have seen you,
   that I shall be happy here,&mdash;that is, if you are happy.

   Your own grateful sister,

   HELEN.

   P. S.&mdash;Any one will direct you to our house; it lies to the left
   near the top of the hill, a little way down a lane that is overhung
   on one side with chestnut-trees and lilacs. I shall be watching for
   you at the gate.
</pre>
    <p>
      Leonard's brow softened, he looked again like his former self. Up from the
      dark sea at his heart smiled the meek face of a child, and the waves lay
      still as at the charm of a spirit.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "And what is Mr. Burley, and what has he written?" asked Leonard of Mr.
      Prickett, when he returned to the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us reply to that question in our own words, for we know more about Mr.
      Burley than Mr. Prickett does.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Burley was the only son of a poor clergyman, in a village near
      Ealing, who had scraped and saved and pinched, to send his son to an
      excellent provincial school in a northern county, and thence to college.
      At the latter, during his first year, young Burley was remarked by the
      undergraduates for his thick shoes and coarse linen, and remarkable to the
      authorities for his assiduity and learning. The highest hopes were
      entertained of him by the tutors and examiners. At the beginning of the
      second year his high animal spirits, before kept down by study, broke out.
      Reading had become easy to him. He knocked off his tasks with a facile
      stroke, as it were. He gave up his leisure hours to Symposia by no means
      Socratical. He fell into an idle, hard-drinking set. He got into all kinds
      of scrapes. The authorities were at first kind and forbearing in their
      admonitions, for they respected his abilities, and still hoped he might
      become an honour to the University. But at last he went drunk into a
      formal examination, and sent in papers, after the manner of Aristophanes,
      containing capital jokes upon the Dons and Big-wigs themselves. The
      offence was the greater and seemed the more premeditated for being clothed
      in Greek. John Burley was expelled. He went home to his father's a
      miserable man, for, with all his follies, he had a good heart. Removed
      from ill example, his life for a year was blameless. He got admitted as
      usher into the school in which he had received instruction as a pupil.
      This school was in a large town. John Burley became member of a club
      formed among the tradesmen, and spent three evenings a week there. His
      astonishing convivial and conversational powers began to declare
      themselves. He grew the oracle of the club; and, from being the most
      sober, peaceful assembly in which grave fathers of a family ever smoked a
      pipe or sipped a glass, it grew under Mr. Burley's auspices the parent of
      revels as frolicking and frantic as those out of which the old Greek Goat
      Song ever tipsily rose. This would not do. There was a great riot in the
      streets one night, and the next morning the usher was dismissed.
      Fortunately for John Burley's conscience, his father had died before this
      happened,&mdash;died believing in the reform of his son. During his
      ushership Mr. Burley had scraped acquaintance with the editor of the
      county newspaper, and given him some capital political articles; for
      Burley was, like Parr and Porson, a notable politician. The editor
      furnished him with letters to the journalists in London, and John came to
      the metropolis and got employed on a very respectable newspaper. At
      college he had known Audley Egerton, though but slightly: that gentleman
      was then just rising into repute in parliament. Burley sympathized with
      some question on which Audley had distinguished himself, and wrote a very
      good article thereon,&mdash;an article so good that Egerton inquired into
      the authorship, found out Burley, and resolved in his own mind to provide
      for him whenever he himself came into office. But Burley was a man whom it
      was impossible to provide for. He soon lost his connection with the news
      paper. First, he was so irregular that he could never be depended upon.
      Secondly, he had strange, honest, eccentric twists of thinking, that could
      coalesce with the thoughts of no party in the long run. An article of his,
      inadvertently admitted, had horrified all the proprietors, staff, and
      readers of the paper. It was diametrically opposite to the principles the
      paper advocated, and compared its pet politician to Catiline. Then John
      Burley shut himself up and wrote books. He wrote two or three books, very
      clever, but not at all to the popular taste,&mdash;abstract and learned,
      full of whims that were caviare to the multitude, and larded with Greek.
      Nevertheless they obtained for him a little money, and among literary men
      some reputation. Now Audley Egerton came into power, and got him, though
      with great difficulty,&mdash;for there were many prejudices against this
      scampish, harum-scarum son of the Muses,&mdash;a place in a public office.
      He kept it about a month, and then voluntarily resigned it. "My crust of
      bread and liberty!" quoth John Burley, and he vanished into a garret. From
      that time to the present he lived&mdash;Heaven knows how! Literature is a
      business, like everything else; John Burley grew more and more incapable
      of business. "He could not do task-work," he said; he wrote when the whim
      seized him, or when the last penny was in his pouch, or when he was
      actually in the spunging-house or the Fleet,&mdash;migrations which
      occurred to him, on an average, twice a year. He could generally sell what
      he had actually written, but no one would engage him beforehand. Editors
      of magazines and other periodicals were very glad to have his articles, on
      the condition that they were anonymous; and his style was not necessarily
      detected, for he could vary it with the facility of a practised pen.
      Audley Egerton continued his best supporter, for there were certain
      questions on which no one wrote with such force as John Burley,&mdash;questions
      connected with the metaphysics of politics, such as law reform and
      economical science. And Audley Egerton was the only man John Burley put
      himself out of the way to serve, and for whom he would give up a drinking
      bout and do task-work; for John Burley was grateful by nature, and he felt
      that Egerton had really tried to befriend him. Indeed, it was true, as he
      had stated to Leonard by the Brent, that even after he had resigned his
      desk in the London office, he had had the offer of an appointment in
      Jamaica, and a place in India, from the minister. But probably there were
      other charms then than those exercised by the one-eyed perch that kept him
      to the neighbourhood of London. With all his grave faults of character and
      conduct, John Burley was not without the fine qualities of a large nature.
      He was most resolutely his own enemy, it is true, but he could hardly be
      said to be any one else's. Even when he criticised some more fortunate
      writer, he was good-humoured in his very satire: he had no bile, no envy.
      And as for freedom from malignant personalities, he might have been a
      model to all critics. I must except politics, however, for in these he
      could be rabid and savage. He had a passion for independence, which,
      though pushed to excess, was not without grandeur. No lick-platter, no
      parasite, no toad-eater, no literary beggar, no hunter after patronage and
      subscriptions; even in his dealings with Audley Egerton, he insisted on
      naming the price for his labours. He took a price, because, as the papers
      required by Audley demanded much reading and detail, which was not at all
      to his taste, he considered himself entitled fairly to something more than
      the editor of the journal wherein the papers appeared was in the habit of
      giving. But he assessed this extra price himself, and as he would have
      done to a bookseller. And when in debt and in prison, though he knew a
      line to Egerton would have extricated him, he never wrote that line. He
      would depend alone on his pen,&mdash;dipped it hastily in the ink, and
      scrawled himself free. The most debased point about him was certainly the
      incorrigible vice of drinking, and with it the usual concomitant of that
      vice,&mdash;the love of low company. To be King of the Bohemians, to
      dazzle by his wild humour, and sometimes to exalt by his fanciful
      eloquence, the rude, gross natures that gathered round him,&mdash;this was
      a royalty that repaid him for all sacrifice of solid dignity; a foolscap
      crown that he would not have changed for an emperor's diadem. Indeed, to
      appreciate rightly the talents of John Burley, it was necessary to hear
      him talk on such occasions. As a writer, after all, he was now only
      capable of unequal desultory efforts; but as a talker, in his own wild
      way, he was original and matchless. And the gift of talk is one of the
      most dangerous gifts a man can possess for his own sake,&mdash;the
      applause is so immediate, and gained with so little labour. Lower and
      lower and lower had sunk John Burley, not only in the opinion of all who
      knew his name, but in the habitual exercise of his talents. And this
      seemed wilfully&mdash;from choice. He would write for some unstamped
      journal of the populace, out of the pale of the law, for pence, when he
      could have got pounds from journals of high repute. He was very fond of
      scribbling off penny ballads, and then standing in the street to hear them
      sung. He actually once made himself the poet of an advertising tailor, and
      enjoyed it excessively. But that did not last long, for John Burley was a
      Pittite,&mdash;not a Tory, he used to say, but a Pittite. And if you had
      heard him talk of Pitt, you would never have known what to make of that
      great statesman. He treated him as the German commentators do Shakspeare,
      and invested him with all imaginary meanings and objects, that would have
      turned the grand practical man into a sibyl. Well, he was a Pittite; the
      tailor a fanatic for Thelwall and Cobbett. Mr. Burley wrote a poem wherein
      Britannia appeared to the tailor, complimented him highly on the art he
      exhibited in adorning the persons of her sons; and bestowing upon him a
      gigantic mantle, said that he, and he alone, might be enabled to fit it to
      the shoulders of living men. The rest of the poem was occupied in Mr.
      Snip's unavailing attempts to adjust this mantle to the eminent
      politicians of the day, when, just as he had sunk down in despair,
      Britannia reappeared to him, and consoled him with the information that he
      had done all mortal man could do, and that she had only desired to
      convince pigmies that no human art could adjust to THEIR proportions the
      mantle of William Pitt. Sic itur ad astra,&mdash;she went back to the
      stars, mantle and all! Mr. Snip was exceedingly indignant at this
      allegorical effusion, and with wrathful shears cut the tie between himself
      and his poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, then, the reader has, we trust, a pretty good idea of John Burley,&mdash;a
      specimen of his genus not very common in any age, and now happily almost
      extinct, since authors of all degrees share in the general improvement in
      order, economy, and sober decorum, which has obtained in the national
      manners. Mr. Prickett, though entering into less historical detail than we
      have done, conveyed to Leonard a tolerably accurate notion of the man,
      representing him as a person of great powers and learning, who had
      thoroughly thrown himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard did not, however, see how much Mr. Burley himself was to be blamed
      for his waste of life; he could not conceive a man of genius voluntarily
      seating himself at the lowest step in the social ladder. He rather
      supposed he had been thrust down there by Necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Mr. Prickett, concluding, said, "Well, I should think Burley
      would cure you of the desire to be an author even more than Chatterton,"
      the young man answered gloomily, "Perhaps," and turned to the
      book-shelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Mr. Prickett's consent, Leonard was released earlier than usual from
      his task, and a little before sunset he took his way to Highgate. He was
      fortunately directed to take the new road by the Regent's Park, and so on
      through a very green and smiling country. The walk, the freshness of the
      air, the songs of the birds, and, above all, when he had got half-way, the
      solitude of the road, served to rouse him from his stern and sombre
      meditations. And when he came into the lane overhung with chestnut-trees,
      and suddenly caught sight of Helen's watchful and then brightening face,
      as she stood by the wicket, and under the shadow of cool, murmurous
      boughs, the blood rushed gayly through his veins, and his heart beat loud
      and gratefully.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      She drew him into the garden with such true childlike joy. Now behold them
      seated in the arbour,&mdash;a perfect bower of sweets and blossoms; the
      wilderness of roof-tops and spires stretching below, broad and far; London
      seen dim and silent, as in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took his hat from his brows gently, and looked him in the face with
      tearful penetrating eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not say, "You are changed." She said, "Why, why did I leave you?"
      and then turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind me, Helen. I am man, and rudely born; speak of yourself. This
      lady is kind to you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she not let me see you? Oh, very kind,&mdash;and look here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen pointed to fruits and cakes set out on the table. "A feast,
      brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she began to press her hospitality with pretty winning ways, more
      playful than was usual to her, and talking very fast, and with forced, but
      silvery, laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees she stole him from his gloom and reserve; and though he could
      not reveal to her the cause of his bitterest sorrow, he owned that he had
      suffered much. He would not have owned that to another living being. And
      then, quickly turning from this brief confession, with assurances that the
      worst was over, he sought to amuse her by speaking of his new acquaintance
      with the perch-fisher. But when he spoke of this man with a kind of
      reluctant admiration, mixed with compassionate yet gloomy interest, and
      drew a grotesque, though subdued, sketch of the wild scene in which he had
      been spectator, Helen grew alarmed and grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, brother, do not go there again,&mdash;do not see more of this bad
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad!&mdash;no! Hopeless and unhappy, he has stooped to stimulants and
      oblivion&mdash;but you cannot understand these things, my pretty
      preacher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do, Leonard. What is the difference between being good and bad?
      The good do not yield to temptations, and the bad do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The definition was so simple and so wise that Leonard was more struck with
      it than he might have been by the most elaborate sermon by Parson Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have often murmured to myself since I lost you, 'Helen was my good
      angel; '&mdash;say on. For my heart is dark to myself, and while you speak
      light seems to dawn on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This praise so confused Helen that she was long before she could obey the
      command annexed to it. But, by little and little, words came to both more
      frankly. And then he told her the sad tale of Chatterton, and waited,
      anxious to hear her comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, seeing that she remained silent, "how can I hope, when
      this mighty genius laboured and despaired? What did he want, save birth
      and fortune and friends and human justice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he pray to God?" asked Helen, drying her tears. Again Leonard was
      startled. In reading the life of Chatterton he had not much noted the
      scepticism, assumed or real, of the ill-fated aspirer to earthly
      immortality. At Helen's question, that scepticism struck him forcibly.
      "Why do you ask that, Helen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, when we pray often, we grow so very, very patient," answered the
      child. "Perhaps, had he been patient a few months more, all would have
      been won by him, as it will be by you, brother, for you pray, and you will
      be patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard bowed his head in deep thought, and this time the thought was not
      gloomy. Then out from that awful life there glowed another passage, which
      before he had not heeded duly, but regarded rather as one of the darkest
      mysteries in the fate of Chatterton.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very time the despairing poet had locked himself up in his garret,
      to dismiss his soul from its earthly ordeal, his genius had just found its
      way into the light of renown. Good and learned and powerful men were
      preparing to serve and save him. Another year&mdash;nay, perchance another
      month&mdash;and he might have stood acknowledged sublime in the foremost
      ranks of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Helen!" cried Leonard, raising his brows, from which the cloud had
      passed, "why, indeed, did you leave me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen started in her turn as he repeated this regret, and in her turn grew
      thoughtful. At length she asked him if he had written for the box which
      had belonged to her father and been left at the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Leonard, though a little chafed at what he thought a childish
      interruption to themes of graver interest, owned, with self-reproach, that
      he had forgotten to do so. Should he not write now to order the box to be
      sent to her at Miss Starke's?
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; let it be sent to you. Take care of it. I should like to know that
      something of mine is with you; and perhaps I may not stay here long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not stay here? That you must, my dear Helen,&mdash;at least as long as
      Miss Starke will keep you, and is kind. By and by" (added Leonard, with
      something of his former sanguine tone) "I may yet make my way, and we
      shall have our cottage to ourselves. But&mdash;oh, Helen!&mdash;I forgot&mdash;you
      wounded me; you left your money with me. I only found it in my drawers the
      other day. Fie! I have brought it back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not mine,&mdash;it is yours. We were to share together,&mdash;you
      paid all; and how can I want it here, too?" But Leonard was obstinate; and
      as Helen mournfully received back all that of fortune her father had
      bequeathed to her, a tall female figure stood at the entrance of the
      arbour, and said, in a voice that scattered all sentiment to the winds,
      "Young man, it is time to go."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Already?" said Helen, with faltering accents, as she crept to Miss
      Starke's side while Leonard rose and bowed. "I am very grateful to you,
      madam," said he, with the grace that comes from all refinement of idea,
      "for allowing me to see Miss Helen. Do not let me abuse your kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Starke seemed struck with his look and manner, and made a stiff half
      courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A form more rigid than Miss Starke's it was hard to conceive. She was like
      the Grim White Woman in the nursery ballads. Yet, apparently, there was a
      good-nature in allowing the stranger to enter her trim garden, and
      providing for him and her little charge those fruits and cakes which
      belied her aspect. "May I go with him to the gate?" whispered Helen, as
      Leonard had already passed up the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may, child; but do not loiter. And then come back, and lock up the
      cakes and cherries, or Patty will get at them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen ran after Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Write to me, brother,&mdash;write to me; and do not, do not be friends
      with this man, who took you to that wicked, wicked place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Helen, I go from you strong enough to brave worse dangers than that,"
      said Leonard, almost gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kissed each other at the little wicket gate, and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard walked home under the summer moonlight, and on entering his
      chamber looked first at his rose-tree. The leaves of yesterday's flowers
      lay strewn around it; but the tree had put forth new buds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nature ever restores," said the young man. He paused a moment, and added,
      "Is it that Nature is very patient?" His sleep that night was not broken
      by the fearful dreams he had lately known. He rose refreshed, and went his
      way to his day's work,&mdash;not stealing along the less crowded paths,
      but with a firm step, through the throng of men. Be bold, adventurer,&mdash;thou
      hast more to suffer! Wilt thou sink? I look into thy heart, and I cannot
      answer.

    <h2>
      INITIAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. CAXTON UPON COURAGE AND PATIENCE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "What is courage?" said my uncle Roland, rousing himself from a revery
      into which he had fallen, after the Sixth Book in this history had been
      read to our family circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is courage?" he repeated more earnestly. "Is it insensibility to
      fear? That may be the mere accident of constitution; and if so, there is
      no more merit in being courageous than in being this table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad to hear you speak thus," observed Mr. Caxton, "for I
      should not like to consider myself a coward; yet I am very sensible to
      fear in all dangers, bodily and moral."
    </p>
    <p>
      "La, Austin, how can you say so?" cried my mother, firing up; "was it not
      only last week that you faced the great bull that was rushing after
      Blanche and the children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche at that recollection stole to my father's chair, and, hanging over
      his shoulder, kissed his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (sublimely unmoved by these flatteries).&mdash;"I don't deny
      that I faced the bull, but I assert that I was horribly frightened."
    </p>
    <p>
      ROLAND.&mdash;"The sense of honour which conquers fear is the true courage
      of chivalry: you could not run away when others were looking on,&mdash;no
      gentleman could."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Fiddledee! It was not on my gentility that I stood,
      Captain. I should have run fast enough, if it had done any good. I stood
      upon my understanding. As the bull could run faster than I could, the only
      chance of escape was to make the brute as frightened as myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      BLANCHE.&mdash;"Ah, you did not think of that; your only thought was to
      save me and the children."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Possibly, my dear, very possibly, I might have been
      afraid for you too; but I was very much afraid for myself. However,
      luckily I had the umbrella, and I sprang it up and spread it forth in the
      animal's stupid eyes, hurling at him simultaneously the biggest lines I
      could think of in the First Chorus of the 'Seven against Thebes.' I began
      with ELEDEMNAS PEDIOPLOKTUPOS; and when I came to the grand howl of [A
      line in Greek], the beast stood appalled as at the roar of a lion. I shall
      never forget his amazed snort at the Greek. Then he kicked up his hind
      legs, and went bolt through the gap in the hedge. Thus, armed with
      AEschylus and the umbrella, I remained master of the field; but"
      (continued Mr. Caxton ingenuously) "I should not like to go through that
      half-minute again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No man would," said the captain, kindly. "I should be very sorry to face
      a bull myself, even with a bigger umbrella than yours, and even though I
      had AEschylus, and Homer to boot, at my fingers' ends."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"You would not have minded if it had been a Frenchman
      with a sword in his hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN.&mdash;"Of course not. Rather liked it than otherwise," he added
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Yet many a Spanish matador, who does n't care a button
      for a bull, would take to his heels at the first lunge en carte from a
      Frenchman. Therefore, in fact, if courage be a matter of constitution, it
      is also a matter of custom. We face calmly the dangers we are habituated
      to, and recoil from those of which we have no familiar experience. I doubt
      if Marshal Turenue himself would have been quite at his ease on the
      tight-rope; and a rope-dancer, who seems disposed to scale the heavens
      with Titanic temerity, might possibly object to charge on a cannon."
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN ROLAND.&mdash;"Still, either this is not the courage I mean, or it
      is another kind of it. I mean by courage that which is the especial force
      and dignity of the human character, without which there is no reliance on
      principle, no constancy in virtue,&mdash;a something," continued my uncle,
      gallantly, and with a half bow towards my mother, "which your sex shares
      with our own. When the lover, for instance, clasps the hand of his
      betrothed, and says, 'Wilt thou be true to me, in spite of absence and
      time, in spite of hazard and fortune, though my foes malign me, though thy
      friends may dissuade thee, and our lot in life may be rough and rude?' and
      when the betrothed answers, 'I will be true,' does not the lover trust to
      her courage as well as her love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirably put, Roland," said my father. "But a propos of what do you
      puzzle us with these queries on courage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN ROLAND (with a slight blush).&mdash;"I was led to the inquiry
      (though perhaps it may be frivolous to take so much thought of what, no
      doubt, costs Pisistratus so little) by the last chapters in my nephew's
      story. I see this poor boy Leonard, alone with his fallen hopes (though
      very irrational they were) and his sense of shame. And I read his heart, I
      dare say, better than Pisistratus does, for I could feel like that boy if
      I had been in the same position; and conjecturing what he and thousands
      like him must go through, I asked myself, 'What can save him and them?' I
      answered, as a soldier would answer, 'Courage.' Very well. But pray;
      Austin, what is courage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (prudently backing out of a reply).&mdash;"Papae!' Brother,
      since you have just complimented the ladies on that quality, you had
      better address your question to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanche here leaned both hands on my father's chair, and said, looking
      down at first bashfully, but afterwards warming with the subject, "Do you
      not think, sir, that little Helen has already suggested, if not what is
      courage, what at least is the real essence of all courage that endures and
      conquers, that ennobles and hallows and redeems? Is it not PATIENCE,
      Father? And that is why we women have a courage of our own. Patience does
      not affect to be superior to fear, but at least it never admits despair."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Kiss me, my Blanche, for you have come near to the
      truth which perplexed the soldier and puzzled the sage."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (tartly).&mdash;"If you mean me by the sage, I was not puzzled
      at all. Heaven knows you do right to inculcate patience,&mdash;it is a
      virtue very much required&mdash;in your readers. Nevertheless," added my
      father, softening with the enjoyment of his joke,&mdash;"nevertheless
      Blanche and Helen are quite right. Patience is the courage of the
      conqueror; it is the virtue, par excellence, of Man against Destiny,&mdash;of
      the One against the World, and of the Soul against Matter. Therefore this
      is the courage of the Gospel; and its importance in a social view&mdash;its
      importance to races and institutions&mdash;cannot be too earnestly
      inculcated. What is it that distinguishes the Anglo-Saxon from all other
      branches of the human family,&mdash;peoples deserts with his children and
      consigns to them the heritage of rising worlds? What but his faculty to
      brave, to suffer, to endure,&mdash;the patience that resists firmly and
      innovates slowly? Compare him with the Frenchman. The Frenchman has plenty
      of valour,&mdash;that there is no denying; but as for fortitude, he has
      not enough to cover the point of a pin. He is ready to rush out of the
      world if he is bitten by a flea."
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN ROLAND.&mdash;"There was a case in the papers the other day,
      Austin, of a Frenchman who actually did destroy himself because he was so
      teased by the little creatures you speak of. He left a paper on his table,
      saying that 'life was not worth having at the price of such torments.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (solemnly).&mdash;"Sir, their whole political history, since
      the great meeting of the Tiers Etat, has been the history of men who would
      rather go to the devil than be bitten by a flea. It is the record of human
      impatience that seeks to force time, and expects to grow forests from the
      spawn of a mushroom. Wherefore, running through all extremes of
      constitutional experiment, when they are nearest to democracy they are
      next door to a despot; and all they have really done is to destroy
      whatever constitutes the foundation of every tolerable government. A
      constitutional monarchy cannot exist without aristocracy, nor a healthful
      republic endure with corruption of manners. The cry of equality is
      incompatible with civilization, which, of necessity, contrasts poverty
      with wealth; and, in short, whether it be an emperor or a mob I that is to
      rule, Force is the sole hope of order, and the government is but an army."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [Published more than a year before the date of the French empire
   under Louis Napoleon.]
</pre>
    <p>
      "Impress, O Pisistratus! impress the value of patience as regards man and
      men. You touch there on the kernel of the social system,&mdash;the secret
      that fortifies the individual and disciplines the million. I care not, for
      my part, if you are tedious so long as you are earnest. Be minute and
      detailed. Let the real Human Life, in its war with Circumstance, stand
      out. Never mind if one can read you but slowly,&mdash;better chance of
      being less quickly forgotten. Patience, patience! By the soul of
      Epictetus, your readers shall set you an example."

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard had written twice to Mrs. Fairfield, twice to Riccabocca, and once
      to Mr. Dale; and the poor proud boy could not bear to betray his
      humiliation. He wrote as with cheerful spirits,&mdash;as if perfectly
      satisfied with his prospects. He said that he was well employed, in the
      midst of books, and that he had found kind friends. Then he turned from
      himself to write about those whom he addressed, and the affairs and
      interests of the quiet world wherein they lived. He did not give his own
      address, nor that of Mr. Prickett. He dated his letters from a small
      coffee-house near the bookseller's, to which he occasionally went for his
      simple meals. He had a motive in this. He did not desire to be found out.
      Mr. Dale replied for himself and for Mrs. Fairfield, to the epistles
      addressed to these two. Riccabocca wrote also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more kind than the replies of both. They came to Leonard
      in a very dark period in his life, and they strengthened him in the
      noiseless battle with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be a good in the world that we do without knowing it, without
      conjecturing the effect it may have upon a human soul; it is when we show
      kindness to the young in the first barren footpath up the mountain of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard's face resumed its serenity in his intercourse with his employer;
      but he did not recover his boyish ingenuous frankness. The under-currents
      flowed again pure from the turbid soil and the splintered fragments uptorn
      from the deep; but they were still too strong and too rapid to allow
      transparency to the surface. And now he stood in the sublime world of
      books, still and earnest as a seer who invokes the dead; and thus, face to
      face with knowledge, hourly he discovered how little he knew. Mr. Prickett
      lent him such works as he selected and asked to take home with him. He
      spent whole nights in reading, and no longer desultorily. He read no more
      poetry, no more Lives of Poets. He read what poets must read if they
      desire to be great&mdash;Sapere principium et fons,&mdash;strict
      reasonings on the human mind; the relations between motive and conduct,
      thought and action; the grave and solemn truths of the past world;
      antiquities, history, philosophy. He was taken out of himself; he was
      carried along the ocean of the universe. In that ocean, O seeker, study
      the law of the tides; and seeing Chance nowhere, Thought presiding over
      all, Fate, that dread phantom, shall vanish from creation, and Providence
      alone be visible in heaven and on earth!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was to be a considerable book-sale at a country house one day's
      journey from London. Mr. Prickett meant to have attended it on his own
      behalf, and that of several gentlemen who had given him commissions for
      purchase; but on the morning fixed for his departure, he was seized with a
      severe return of his old foe the rheumatism. He requested Leonard to
      attend instead of himself. Leonard went, and was absent for the three days
      during which the sale lasted. He returned late in the evening, and went at
      once to Mr. Prickett's house. The shop was closed; he knocked at the
      private entrance; a strange person opened the door to him, and in reply to
      his question if Mr. Prickett was at home, said, with a long and funereal
      face, "Young man, Mr. Prickett senior is gone to his long home, but Mr.
      Richard Prickett will see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a very grave-looking man, with lank hair, looked forth from
      the side-door communicating between the shop and the passage, and then
      stepped forward. "Come in, sir; you are my late uncle's assistant, Mr.
      Fairfield, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your late uncle! Heavens, sir, do I understand aright, can Mr. Prickett
      be dead since I left London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Died, sir, suddenly, last night. It was an affection of the heart. The
      doctor thinks the rheumatism attacked that organ. He had small time to
      provide for his departure, and his account-books seem in sad disorder: I
      am his nephew and executor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard had now&mdash;followed the nephew into the shop. There still
      burned the gas-lamp. The place seemed more dingy and cavernous than
      before. Death always makes its presence felt in the house it visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was greatly affected,&mdash;and yet more, perhaps, by the utter
      want of feeling which the nephew exhibited. In fact the deceased had not
      been on friendly terms with this person, his nearest relative and
      heir-at-law, who was also a bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were engaged but by the week, I find, young man, on reference to my
      late uncle's papers. He gave you L1 a week,&mdash;a monstrous sum! I shall
      not require your services any further. I shall move these books to my own
      house. You will be good enough to send me a list of those you bought at
      the sale, and your account of travelling expenses, etc. What may be due to
      you shall be sent to your address. Good-evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard went home, shocked and saddened at the sudden death of his kind
      employer. He did not think much of himself that night; but when he rose
      the next day, he suddenly felt that the world of London lay before him,
      without a friend, without a calling, without an occupation for bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time it was no fancied sorrow, no poetic dream disappointed. Before
      him, gaunt and palpable, stood Famine. Escape!&mdash;yes. Back to the
      village: his mother's cottage; the exile's garden; the radishes and the
      fount. Why could he not escape? Ask why civilization cannot escape its
      ills, and fly back to the wild and the wigwam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard could not have returned to the cottage, even if the Famine that
      faced had already seized him with her skeleton hand. London releases not
      so readily her fated step-sons.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day three persons were standing before an old bookstall in a passage
      leading from Oxford Street into Tottenham Court Road. Two were gentlemen;
      the third, of the class and appearance of those who more habitually halt
      at old bookstalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look," said one of the gentlemen to the other, "I have discovered here
      what I have searched for in vain the last ten years,&mdash;the Horace of
      1580, the Horace of the Forty Commentators, a perfect treasury of
      learning, and marked only fourteen shillings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, Norreys," said the other, "and observe what is yet more worth your
      study;" and he pointed to the third bystander, whose face, sharp and
      attenuated, was bent with an absorbed, and, as it were, with a hungering
      attention over an old worm-eaten volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the book, my lord?" whispered Mr. Norreys. His companion smiled,
      and replied by another question, "What is the man who reads the book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Norreys moved a few paces, and looked over the student's shoulder.
      "Preston's translation of Boethius's 'The Consolations of Philosophy,'" he
      said, coming back to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks as if he wanted all the consolations Philosophy can give him,
      poor boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a fourth passenger paused at the bookstall, and,
      recognizing the pale student, placed his hand on his shoulder, and said,
      "Aha, young sir, we meet again. So poor Prickett is dead. But you are
      still haunted by associations. Books, books,&mdash;magnets to which all
      iron minds move insensibly. What is this? Boethius! Ah, a book written in
      prison, but a little time before the advent of the only philosopher who
      solves to the simplest understanding every mystery of life&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that philosopher?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is death!" said Mr. Burley. "How can you be dull enough to ask? Poor
      Boethius, rich, nobly born, a consul, his sons consuls, the world one
      smile to the Last Philosopher of Rome. Then suddenly, against this type of
      the old world's departing WISDOM stands frowning the new world's grim
      genius, FORCE,&mdash;Theodoric the Ostrogoth condemning Boethius the
      schoolman; and Boethius in his Pavian dungeon holding a dialogue with the
      shade of Athenian Philosophy. It is the finest picture upon which lingers
      the glimmering of the Western golden day, before night rushes over time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," said Mr. Norreys, abruptly, "Boethius comes back to us with the
      faint gleam of returning light, translated by Alfred the Great; and,
      again, as the sun of knowledge bursts forth in all its splendour by Queen
      Elizabeth. Boethius influences us as we stand in this passage; and that is
      the best of all the Consolations of Philosophy,&mdash;eh, Mr. Burley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burley turned and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other; you could not see a greater contrast,&mdash;Mr.
      Burley, his gay green dress already shabby and soiled, with a rent in the
      skirts and his face speaking of habitual night-cups; Mr. Norreys, neat and
      somewhat precise in dress, with firm, lean figure, and quiet, collected,
      vigorous energy in his eye and aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If," replied Mr. Burley, "a poor devil like me may argue with a gentleman
      who may command his own price with the booksellers, I should say it is no
      consolation at all, Mr. Norreys. And I should like to see any man of sense
      accept the condition of Boethius in his prison, with some strangler or
      headsman waiting behind the door, upon the promised proviso that he should
      be translated, centuries afterwards, by kings and queens, and help
      indirectly to influence the minds of Northern barbarians, babbling about
      him in an alley, jostled by passers-by who never heard the name of
      Boethius, and who don't care a fig for philosophy. Your servant, sir,
      young man, come and talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley hooked his arm within Leonard's, and led the boy passively away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a clever man," said Harley L'Estrange. "But I am sorry to see yon
      young student, with his bright earnest eyes, and his lip that has the
      quiver of passion and enthusiasm, leaning on the arm of a guide who seems
      disenchanted of all that gives purpose to learning, and links philosophy
      with use to the world. Who and what is this clever man whom you call
      Burley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who might have been famous, if he had condescended to be
      respectable! The boy listening to us both so attentively interested me
      too,&mdash;I should like to have the making of him. But I must buy this
      Horace."
    </p>
    <p>
      The shopman, lurking within his hole like a spider for flies, was now
      called out. And when Mr. Norreys had bought the Horace, and given an
      address where to send it, Harley asked the shopman if he knew the young
      man who had been reading Boethius.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only by sight. He has come here every day the last week, and spends hours
      at the stall. When once he fastens on a book, he reads it through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And never buys?" said Mr. Norreys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said the shopman, with a good-natured smile, "they who buy seldom
      read. The poor boy pays me twopence a day to read as long as he pleases. I
      would not take it, but he is proud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have known men amass great learning in that way," said Mr. Norreys.
      "Yes, I should like to have that boy in my hands. And now, my lord, I am
      at your service, and we will go to the studio of your artist."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen walked on towards one of the streets out of Fitzroy
      Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more Harley L'Estrange was in his element, seated
      carelessly on a deal table smoking his cigar, and discussing art with the
      gusto of a man who honestly loved, and the taste of a man who thoroughly
      understood it. The young artist, in his dressing robe, adding slow touch
      upon touch, paused often to listen the better. And Henry Norrey s,
      enjoying the brief respite from a life of great labour, was gladly
      reminded of idle hours under rosy skies; for these three men had formed
      their friendship in Italy, where the bands of friendship are woven by the
      hands of the Graces.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard and Mr. Burley walked on into the suburbs round the north road
      from London, and Mr. Burley offered to find literary employment for
      Leonard,&mdash;an offer eagerly accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went into a public-house by the wayside. Burley demanded a
      private room, called for pen, ink, and paper; and placing these implements
      before Leonard, said, "Write what you please, in prose, five sheets of
      letter-paper, twenty-two lines to a page,&mdash;neither more nor less."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot write so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut, 't is for bread."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy's face crimsoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must forget that," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is an arbour in the garden, under a weeping-ash," returned Burley.
      "Go there, and fancy yourself in Arcadia."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was too pleased to obey. He found out the little arbour at one end
      of a deserted bowling-green. All was still,&mdash;the hedgerow shut out
      the sight of the inn. The sun lay warm on the grass, and glinted
      pleasantly through the leaves of the ash. And Leonard there wrote the
      first essay from his hand as Author by profession. What was it that he
      wrote? His dreamy impressions of London, an anathema on its streets and
      its hearts of stone, murmurs against poverty, dark elegies on fate?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, no! little knowest thou true genius, if thou askest such questions, or
      thinkest that there under the weeping-ash the task-work for bread was
      remembered; or that the sunbeam glinted but over the practical world,
      which, vulgar and sordid, lay around. Leonard wrote a fairy tale,&mdash;one
      of the loveliest you can conceive, with a delicate touch of playful
      humour, in a style all flowered over with happy fancies. He smiled as he
      wrote the last word,&mdash;he was happy. In rather more than an hour Mr.
      Burley came to him, and found him with that smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burley had a glass of brandy-and-water in his hand; it was his third.
      He too smiled, he too looked happy. He read the paper aloud, and well. He
      was very complimentary. "You will do!" said he, clapping Leonard on the
      back. "Perhaps some day you will catch my one-eyed perch." Then he folded
      up the manuscript, scribbled off a note, put the whole in one envelope,
      and they returned to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Burley disappeared within a dingy office near Fleet Street, on which
      was inscribed, "Office of the 'Beehive,'" and soon came forth with a
      golden sovereign in his hand, Leonard's first-fruits. Leonard thought Peru
      lay before him. He accompanied Mr. Burley to that gentleman's lodging in
      Maida Hill. The walk had been very long; Leonard was not fatigued. He
      listened with a livelier attention than before to Burley's talk. And when
      they reached the apartments of the latter, and Mr. Burley sent to the
      cookshop, and their joint supper was taken out of the golden sovereign,
      Leonard felt proud, and for the first time for weeks he laughed the
      heart's laugh. The two writers grew more and more intimate and cordial.
      And there was a vast deal in Burley by which any young man might be made
      the wiser. There was no apparent evidence of poverty in the apartments,&mdash;clean,
      new, well-furnished; but all things in the most horrible litter,&mdash;all
      speaking of the huge literary sloven.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days Leonard almost lived in those rooms. He wrote
      continuously, save when Burley's conversation fascinated him into
      idleness. Nay, it was not idleness,&mdash;his knowledge grew larger as he
      listened; but the cynicism of the talker began slowly to work its way.
      That cynicism in which there was no faith, no hope, no vivifying breath
      from Glory, from Religion,&mdash;the cynicism of the Epicurean, more
      degraded in his sty than ever was Diogenes in his tub; and yet presented
      with such ease and such eloquence, with such art and such mirth, so
      adorned with illustration and anecdote, so unconscious of debasement!
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange and dread philosophy, that made it a maxim to squander the gifts
      of mind on the mere care for matter, and fit the soul to live but as from
      day to day, with its scornful cry, "A fig for immortality and laurels!" An
      author for bread! Oh, miserable calling! was there something grand and
      holy, after all, even in Chatterton's despair?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The villanous "Beehive"! Bread was worked out of it, certainly; but fame,
      but hope for the future,&mdash;certainly not. Milton's Paradise Lost would
      have perished without a sound had it appeared in the "Beehive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine things were there in a fragmentary crude state, composed by Burley
      himself. At the end of a week they were dead and forgotten,&mdash;never
      read by one man of education and taste; taken simultaneously and
      indifferently with shallow politics and wretched essays, yet selling,
      perhaps, twenty or thirty thousand copies,&mdash;an immense sale; and
      nothing got out of them but bread and brandy!
    </p>
    <p>
      "What more would you have?" cried John Burley. "Did not stern old Sam
      Johnson say he could never write but from want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might say it," answered Leonard; "but he never meant posterity to
      believe him. And he would have died of want, I suspect, rather than have
      written 'Rasselas' for the 'Beehive'! Want is a grand thing," continued
      the boy, thoughtfully,&mdash;"a parent of grand things. Necessity is
      strong, and should give us its own strength; but Want should shatter
      asunder, with its very writhings, the walls of our prison-house, and not
      sit contented with the allowance the jail gives us in exchange for our
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no prison-house to a man who calls upon Bacchus; stay, I will
      translate to you Schiller's Dithyramb. 'Then see I Bacchus; then up come
      Cupid and Phoebus, and all the Celestials are filling my dwelling.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Breaking into impromptu careless rhymes, Burley threw off a rude but
      spirited translation of that divine lyric. "O materialist!" cried the boy,
      with his bright eyes suffused. "Schiller calls on the gods to take him to
      their heaven with them; and you would debase the gods to a ginpalace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, ho!" cried Burley, with his giant laugh. "Drink, and you will
      understand the Dithyramb."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Suddenly one morning, as Leonard sat with Burley, a fashionable cabriolet,
      with a very handsome horse, stopped at the door. A loud knock, a quick
      step on the stairs, and Randal Leslie entered. Leonard recognized him, and
      started. Randal glanced at him in surprise, and then, with a tact that
      showed he had already learned to profit by London life, after shaking
      hands with Burley, approached, and said, with some successful attempt at
      ease, "Unless I am not mistaken, sir, we have met before. If you remember
      me, I hope all boyish quarrels are forgotten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard bowed, and his heart was still good enough to be softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where could you two ever have met?" asked Burley. "In a village green,
      and in single combat," answered Randal, smiling; and he told the story of
      the Battle of the Stocks, with a well-bred jest on himself. Burley laughed
      at the story. "But," said he, when this laugh was over, "my young friend
      had better have remained guardian of the village stocks than come to
      London in search of such fortune as lies at the bottom of an inkhorn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Randal, with the secret contempt which men elaborately
      cultivated are apt to feel for those who seek to educate themselves,&mdash;"ah,
      you make literature your calling, sir? At what school did you conceive a
      taste for letters? Not very common at our great public schools."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at school now for the first time," answered Leonard, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Experience is the best schoolmistress," said Burley; "and that was the
      maxim of Goethe, who had book-learning enough, in all conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal slightly shrugged his shoulders, and without wasting another
      thought on Leonard, peasant-born and self-taught, took his seat, and began
      to talk to Burley upon a political question, which made then the war-cry
      between the two great parliamentary parties. It was a subject in which
      Burley showed much general knowledge; and Randal, seeming to differ from
      him, drew forth alike his information and his argumentative powers. The
      conversation lasted more than an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't quite agree with you," said Randal, taking his leave; "but you
      must allow me to call again,&mdash;will the same hour tomorrow suit you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Burley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went the young man in his cabriolet. Leonard watched him from the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      For five days, consecutively, did Randal call and discuss the question in
      all its bearings; and Burley, after the second day, got interested in the
      matter, looked up his authorities, refreshed his memory, and even spent an
      hour or two in the Library of the British Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the fifth day, Burley had really exhausted all that could well be said
      on his side of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, during these colloquies, had sat apart seemingly absorbed in
      reading, and secretly stung by Randal's disregard of his presence. For
      indeed that young man, in his superb self-esteem, and in the absorption of
      his ambitious projects, scarce felt even curiosity as to Leonard's rise
      above his earlier station, and looked on him as a mere journeyman of
      Burley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the self-taught are keen and quick observers; and Leonard had remarked
      that Randal seemed more as one playing a part for some private purpose,
      than arguing in earnest; and that, when he rose, and said, "Mr. Burley,
      you have convinced me," it was not with the modesty of a sincere reasoner,
      but the triumph of one who has gained his end. But so struck, meanwhile,
      was our unheeded and silent listener with Burley's power of generalization
      and the wide surface over which his information extended, that when Randal
      left the room the boy looked at the slovenly, purposeless man, and said
      aloud, "True; knowledge is not power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Burley, dryly,&mdash;"the weakest thing in the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowledge is power," muttered Randal Leslie, as, with a smile on his lip,
      he drove from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many days after this last interview there appeared a short pamphlet;
      anonymous, but one which made a great impression on the town. It was on
      the subject discussed between Randal and Burley. It was quoted at great
      length in the newspapers. And Burley started to his feet one morning, and
      exclaimed, "My own thoughts! my very words! Who the devil is this
      pamphleteer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard took the newspaper from Burley's hand. The most flattering
      encomiums preceded the extracts, and the extracts were as stereotypes of
      Burley's talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you doubt the author?" cried Leonard, in deep disgust and ingenuous
      scorn. "The young man who came to steal your brains, and turn your
      knowledge&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Into power," interrupted Burley, with a laugh,&mdash;but it was a laugh
      of pain. "Well, this was very mean; I shall tell him so when he comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will come no more," said Leonard. Nor did Randal come again. But he
      sent Mr. Burley a copy of the pamphlet with a polite note, saying, with
      candid but careless acknowledgment, that he "had profited much by Mr.
      Burley's hints and remarks."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it was in all the papers that the pamphlet which had made so great
      a noise was by a very young man, Mr. Audley Egerton's relation. And high
      hopes were expressed of the future career of Mr. Randal Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley still attempted to laugh, and still his pain was visible. Leonard
      most cordially despised and hated Randal Leslie, and his heart moved to
      Burley with noble but perilous compassion. In his desire to soothe and
      comfort the man whom he deemed cheated out of fame, he forgot the caution
      he had hitherto imposed on himself, and yielded more and more to the charm
      of that wasted intellect. He accompanied Burley now to the haunts to which
      his friend went to spend his evenings; and more and more&mdash;though
      gradually, and with many a recoil and self-rebuke&mdash;there crept over
      him the cynic's contempt for glory, and miserable philosophy of debased
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal had risen into grave repute upon the strength of Burley's
      knowledge. But, had Burley written the pamphlet, would the same repute
      have attended him? Certainly not. Randal Leslie brought to that knowledge
      qualities all his own,&mdash;a style simple, strong, and logical; a
      certain tone of good society, and allusions to men and to parties that
      showed his connection with a Cabinet minister, and proved that he had
      profited no less by Egerton's talk than Burley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Burley written the pamphlet, it would have showed more genius, it
      would have had humour and wit, but have been so full of whims and quips,
      sins against taste, and defects in earnestness, that it would have failed
      to create any serious sensation. Here, then, there was something else be
      sides knowledge, by which knowledge became power. Knowledge must not smell
      of the brandy-bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie might be mean in his plagiarism, but he turned the useless
      into use. And so far he was original. But one's admiration, after all,
      rests where Leonard's rested,&mdash;with the poor, riotous, lawless, big,
      fallen man. Burley took himself off to the Brent, and fished again for the
      one-eyed perch. Leonard accompanied him. His feelings were indeed
      different from what they had been when he had reclined under the old tree,
      and talked with Helen of the future. But it was almost pathetic to see how
      Burley's nature seemed to alter, as he strayed along the banks of the
      rivulet, and discoursed of his own boyhood. The man then seemed restored
      to something of the innocence of the child. He cared, in truth, little for
      the perch, which continued intractable, but he enjoyed the air and the
      sky, the rustling grass and the murmuring waters. These excursions to the
      haunts of youth seemed to rebaptize him, and then his eloquence took a
      pastoral character, and Izaak Walton himself would have loved to hear him.
      But as he got back into the smoke of the metropolis, and the gas-lamps
      made him forget the ruddy sunset and the soft evening star, the gross
      habits reassumed their sway; and on he went with his swaggering, reckless
      step to the orgies in which his abused intellect flamed forth, and then
      sank into the socket quenched and rayless.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen was seized with profound and anxious sadness. Leonard had been three
      or four times to see her, and each time she saw a change in him that
      excited all her fears. He seemed, it is true, more shrewd, more
      worldly-wise, more fitted, it might be, for coarse daily life; but, on the
      other hand, the freshness and glory of his youth were waning slowly. His
      aspirings drooped earthward. He had not mastered the Practical, and
      moulded its uses with the strong hand of the Spiritual Architect, of the
      Ideal Builder; the Practical was overpowering himself. She grew pale when
      he talked of Burley, and shuddered, poor little Helen? when she found he
      was daily, and almost nightly, in a companionship which, with her native
      honest prudence, she saw so unsuited to strengthen him in his struggles,
      and aid him against temptation. She almost groaned when, pressing him as
      to his pecuniary means, she found his old terror of debt seemed fading
      away, and the solid healthful principles he had taken from his village
      were loosening fast. Under all, it is true, there was what a wiser and
      older person than Helen would have hailed as the redeeming promise. But
      that something was grief,&mdash;a sublime grief in his own sense of
      falling, in his own impotence against the Fate he had provoked and
      coveted. The Sublimity of that grief Helen could not detect; she saw only
      that it was grief, and she grieved with it, letting it excuse every fault,&mdash;making
      her more anxious to comfort, in order that she might save. Even from the
      first, when Leonard had exclaimed, "Ah, Helen, why did you ever leave me?"
      she had revolved the idea of return to him; and when in the boy's last
      visit he told her that Burley, persecuted by duns, was about to fly from
      his present lodgings, and take his abode with Leonard, in the room she had
      left vacant, all doubt was over. She resolved to sacrifice the safety and
      shelter of the home assured her. She resolved to come back and share
      Leonard's penury and struggles, and save the old room, wherein she had
      prayed for him, from the tempter's dangerous presence. Should she burden
      him? No; she had assisted her father by many little female arts in needle
      and fancy work. She had improved herself in these during her sojourn with
      Miss Starke. She could bring her share to the common stock. Possessed with
      this idea, she determined to realize it before the day on which Leonard
      had told her Burley was to move his quarters. Accordingly she rose very
      early one morning; she wrote a pretty and grateful note to Miss Starke,
      who was fast asleep, left it on the table, and before any one was astir,
      stole from the house, her little bundle on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lingered an instant at the garden-gate, with a remorseful sentiment,&mdash;a
      feeling that she had ill-repaid the cold and prim protection that Miss
      Starke had shown her. But sisterly love carried all before it. She closed
      the gate with a sigh, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived at the lodging-house before Leonard was up, took possession of
      her old chamber, and presenting herself to Leonard, as he was about to go
      forth, said (story-teller that she was), "I am sent away, brother, and I
      have come to you to take care of me. Do not let us part again. But you
      must be very cheerful and very happy, or I shall think that I am sadly in
      your way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard at first did look cheerful, and even happy; but then he thought of
      Burley, and then of his own means of supporting Helen, and was
      embarrassed, and began questioning her as to the possibility of
      reconciliation with Miss Starke. And Helen said gravely, "Impossible,&mdash;do
      not ask it, and do not go near her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Leonard thought she had been humbled and insulted, and remembered
      that she was a gentleman's child, and felt for her wounded pride, he was
      so proud himself. Yet still he was embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I keep the purse again, Leonard?" said Helen, coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" replied Leonard, "the purse is empty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very naughty in the purse," said Helen, "since you put so much
      into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did not you say that you made, at least, a guinea a week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but Burley takes the money; and then, poor fellow! as I owe all to
      him, I have not the heart to prevent him spending it as he likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, I wish you could settle the month's rent," said the landlady,
      suddenly showing herself. She said it civilly, but with firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard coloured. "It shall be paid to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he pressed his hat on his head, and putting Helen gently aside, went
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak to me in future, kind Mrs. Smedley," said Helen, with the air of a
      housewife. "He is always in study, and must not be disturbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady&mdash;a good woman, though she liked her rent&mdash;smiled
      benignly. She was fond of Helen, whom she had known of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad you are come back; and perhaps now the young man will not
      keep such late hours. I meant to give him warning, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he will be a great man one of these days, and you must bear with him
      now." And Helen kissed Mrs. Smedley, and sent her away half inclined to
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Helen busied herself in the rooms. She found her father's box, which
      had been duly forwarded. She re-examined its contents, and wept as she
      touched each humble and pious relic. But her father's memory itself thus
      seemed to give this home a sanction which the former had not; and she rose
      quietly and began mechanically to put things in order, sighing as she saw
      all so neglected, till she came to the rosetree, and that alone showed
      heed and care. "Dear Leonard!" she murmured, and the smile resettled on
      her lips.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing, perhaps, could have severed Leonard from Burley but Helen's
      return to his care. It was impossible for him, even had there been another
      room in the house vacant (which there was not), to install this noisy,
      riotous son of the Muse by Bacchus, talking at random and smelling of
      spirits, in the same dwelling with an innocent, delicate, timid, female
      child. And Leonard could not leave her alone all the twenty-four hours.
      She restored a home to him and imposed its duties. He therefore told Mr.
      Burley that in future he should write and study in his own room, and
      hinted, with many a blush, and as delicately as he could, that it seemed
      to him that whatever he obtained from his pen ought to be halved with
      Burley, to whose interest he owed the employment, and from whose books or
      whose knowledge he took what helped to maintain it; but that the other
      half, if his, he could no longer afford to spend upon feasts or libations.
      He had another life to provide for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley pooh-poohed the notion of taking half his coadjutor's earning with
      much grandeur, but spoke very fretfully of Leonard's sober appropriation
      of the other half; and though a good-natured, warm-hearted man, felt
      extremely indignant at the sudden interposition of poor Helen. However,
      Leonard was firm; and then Burley grew sullen, and so they parted. But the
      rent was still to be paid. How? Leonard for the first time thought of the
      pawnbroker. He had clothes to spare, and Riccabocca's watch. No; that last
      he shrank from applying to such base uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home at noon, and met Helen at the street-door. She too had been
      out, and her soft cheek was rosy red with unwonted exercise and the sense
      of joy. She had still preserved the few gold pieces which Leonard had
      taken back to her on his first visit to Miss Starke's. She had now gone
      out and bought wool and implements for work; and meanwhile she had paid
      the rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard did not object to the work, but he blushed deeply when he knew
      about the rent, and was very angry. He paid back to her that night what
      she had advanced; and Helen wept silently at his pride, and wept more when
      she saw the next day a woful hiatus in his wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Leonard now worked at home, and worked resolutely; and Helen sat by
      his side, working too; so that next day, and the next, slipped peacefully
      away, and in the evening of the second he asked her to walk out in the
      fields. She sprang up joyously at the invitation, when bang went the door,
      and in reeled John Burley,&mdash;drunk,&mdash;and so drunk!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0127" id="link2HCH0127">

    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And with Burley there reeled in another man,&mdash;a friend of his, a man
      who had been a wealthy trader and once well to do, but who, unluckily, had
      literary tastes, and was fond of hearing Burley talk. So, since he had
      known the wit, his business had fallen from him, and he had passed through
      the Bankrupt Court. A very shabby-looking dog he was, indeed, and his nose
      was redder than Burley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      John made a drunken dash at poor Helen. "So you are the Pentheus in
      petticoats who defies Bacchus," cried he; and therewith he roared out a
      verse from Euripides. Helen ran away, and Leonard interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For shame, Burley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's drunk," said Mr. Douce, the bankrupt trader, "very drunk; don't mind
      him. I say, sir, I hope we don't intrude. Sit still, Burley, sit still,
      and talk, do,&mdash;that's a good man. You should hear him&mdash;ta&mdash;ta&mdash;talk,
      sir." Leonard meanwhile had got Helen out of the room into her own, and
      begged her not to be alarmed, and keep the door locked. He then returned
      to Burley, who had seated himself on the bed, trying wondrous hard to keep
      himself upright; while Mr. Douce was striving to light a short pipe that
      he carried in his button-hole&mdash;without having filled it&mdash;and,
      naturally failing in that attempt, was now beginning to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard was deeply shocked and revolted for Helen's sake; but it was
      hopeless to make Burley listen to reason. And how could the boy turn out
      of his room the man to whom he was under obligations?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there smote upon Helen's shrinking ears loud jarring talk and
      maudlin laughter, and cracked attempts at jovial songs. Then she heard
      Mrs. Smedley in Leonard's room, remonstrating; and Burley's laugh was
      louder than before, and Mrs. Smedley, who was a meek woman, evidently got
      frightened, and was heard in precipitate retreat. Long and loud talk
      recommenced, Burley's great voice predominant, Mr. Douce chiming in with
      hiccoughy broken treble. Hour after hour this lasted, for want of the
      drink that would have brought it to a premature close. And Burley
      gradually began to talk himself somewhat sober. Then Mr. Douce was heard
      descending the stairs, and silence followed. At dawn, Leonard knocked at
      Helen's door. She opened it at once, for she had not gone to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen," said he, very sadly, "you cannot continue here. I must find out
      some proper home for you. This man has served me when all London was
      friendless, and he tells me that he has nowhere else to go,&mdash;that the
      bailiffs are after him. He has now fallen asleep. I will go and find you
      some lodging close at hand, for I cannot expel him who has protected me;
      and yet you cannot be under the same roof with him. My own good angel, I
      must lose you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait for her answer, but hurried down stairs. The morning
      looked through the shutterless panes in Leonard's garret, and the birds
      began to chirp from the elmtree, when Burley rose and shook himself, and
      stared round. He could not quite make out where he was. He got hold of the
      water-jug, which he emptied at three draughts, and felt greatly refreshed.
      He then began to reconnoitre the chamber,&mdash;looked at Leonard's
      manuscripts, peeped into the drawers, wondered where the devil Leonard
      himself had gone to, and finally amused himself by throwing down the
      fireirons, ringing the bell, and making all the noise he could, in the
      hopes of attracting the attention of somebody or other, and procuring
      himself his morning dram.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this charivari the door opened softly, but as if with a
      resolute hand, and the small quiet form of Helen stood before the
      threshold. Burley turned round, and the two looked at each other for some
      moments with silent scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLEY (composing his features into their most friendly expression).&mdash;"Come
      hither, my dear. So you are the little girl whom I saw with Leonard on the
      banks of the Brent, and you have come back to live with him,&mdash;and I
      have come to live with him too. You shall be our little housekeeper, and I
      will tell you the story of Prince Pettyman, and a great many others not to
      be found in 'Mother Goose.' Meanwhile, my dear little girl, here's
      sixpence,&mdash;just run out and change this for its worth in rum."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (coming slowly up to Mr. Burley, and still gazing earnestly into his
      face).&mdash;"Ah, sir, Leonard says you have a kind heart, and that you
      have served him; he cannot ask you to leave the house; and so I, who have
      never served him, am to go hence and live alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLEY (moved).&mdash;"You go, my little lady; and why? Can we not all
      live together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"No, sir. I left everything to come to Leonard, for we had
      met first at my father's grave; but you rob me of him, and I have no other
      friend on earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLEY (discomposed).&mdash;"Explain yourself. Why must you leave him
      because I come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked at Mr. Burley again, long and wistfully, but made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      BURLEY (with a gulp).&mdash;"Is it because he thinks I am not fit company
      for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen bowed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley winced, and after a moment's pause said, "He is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (obeying the impulse of her heart, springs forward and takes
      Burley's hand).&mdash;"Ah, sir," she cried, "before he knew you he was so
      different; then he was cheerful, then, even when his first disappointment
      came, I grieved and wept but I felt he would conquer still, for his heart
      was so good and pure. Oh, sir, don't think I reproach you; but what is to
      become of him if&mdash;if&mdash;No, it is not for myself I speak. I know
      that if I was here, that if he had me to care for, he would come home
      early, and work patiently, and&mdash;and&mdash;that I might save him. But
      now when I am gone, and you live with him,&mdash;you to whom he is
      grateful, you whom he would follow against his own conscience (you must
      see that, sir), what is to become of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen's voice died in sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley took three or four long strides through the room; he was greatly
      agitated. "I am a demon," he murmured. "I never saw it before; but it is
      true, I should be this boy's ruin." Tears stood in his eyes, he paused
      abruptly, made a clutch at his hat, and turned to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen stopped the way, and taking him gently by the arm, said, "Oh, sir,
      forgive me,&mdash;I have pained you;" and looked up at him with a
      compassionate expression, that indeed made the child's sweet face as that
      of an angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley bent down as if to kiss her, and then drew back, perhaps with a
      sentiment that his lips were not worthy to touch that innocent brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had had a sister,&mdash;a child like you, little one," he muttered,
      "perhaps I too might have been saved in time. Now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, now you may stay, sir; I don't fear you any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; you would fear me again ere night-time, and I might not be always
      in the right mood to listen to a voice like yours, child. Your Leonard has
      a noble heart and rare gifts. He should rise yet, and he shall. I will not
      drag him into the mire. Good-by,&mdash;you will see me no more." He broke
      from Helen, cleared the stairs with a bound, and was out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Leonard returned he was surprised to hear his unwelcome guest was
      gone,&mdash;but Helen did not venture to tell him of her interposition.
      She knew instinctively how such officiousness would mortify and offend the
      pride of man; but she never again spoke harshly of poor Burley. Leonard
      supposed that he should either see or hear of the humourist in the course
      of the day. Finding he did not, he went in search of him at his old
      haunts; but no trace. He inquired at the "Beehive" if they knew there of
      his new address, but no tidings of Burley could be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came home disappointed and anxious, for he felt uneasy as to the
      disappearance of his wild friend, Mrs. Smedley met him at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir, suit yourself with another lodging," said she. "I can have
      no such singings and shoutings going on at night in my house. And that
      poor little girl, too! you should be ashamed of yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard frowned, and passed by.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, on leaving Helen, Burley strode on; and, as if by some better
      instinct, for he was unconscious of his own steps, he took his way towards
      the still green haunts of his youth. When he paused at length, he was
      already before the door of a rural cottage, standing alone in the midst of
      fields, with a little farmyard at the back; and far through the trees in
      front was caught a glimpse of the winding Brent.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this cottage Burley was familiar; it was inhabited by a good old
      couple who had known him from a boy. There he habitually left his rods and
      fishing-tackle; there, for intervals in his turbid, riotous life, he had
      sojourned for two or three days together, fancying the first day that the
      country was a heaven, and convinced before the third that it was a
      purgatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old woman, of neat and tidy exterior, came forth to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Master John," said she, clasping his nerveless hand, "well, the
      fields be pleasant now; I hope you are come to stay a bit? Do; it will
      freshen you; you lose all the fine colour you had once, in Lunnon town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will stay with you, my kind friend," said Burley, with unusual
      meekness; "I can have the old room, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, come and look at it. I never let it now to any one but you,&mdash;never
      have let it since the dear beautiful lady with the angel's face went away.
      Poor thing, what could have become of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, while Burley listened not, the old woman drew him within
      the cottage, and led him up the stairs into a room that might have well
      become a better house, for it was furnished with taste, and even elegance.
      A small cabinet pianoforte stood opposite the fireplace, and the window
      looked upon pleasant meads and tangled hedgerows, and the narrow windings
      of the blue rivulet. Burley sank down exhausted, and gazed wistfully from
      the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not breakfasted?" said the hostess, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the eggs are fresh laid, and you would like a rasher of bacon,
      Master John? And if you will have brandy in your tea, I have some that you
      left long ago in your own bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley shook his head. "No brandy, Mrs. Goodyer; only fresh milk. I will
      see whether I can yet coax Nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Goodyer did not know what was meant by coaxing Nature, but she said,
      "Pray do, Master John," and vanished. That day Burley went out with his
      rod, and he fished hard for the one-eyed perch; but in vain. Then he roved
      along the stream with his hands in his pockets, whistling. He returned to
      the cottage at sunset, partook of the fare provided for him, abstained
      from the brandy, and felt dreadfully low.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called for pen, ink, and paper, and sought to write, but could not
      achieve two lines. He summoned Mrs. Goodyer. "Tell your husband to come
      and sit and talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Up came old Jacob Goodyer, and the great wit bade him tell him all the
      news of the village. Jacob obeyed willingly, and Burley at last fell
      asleep. The next day it was much the same, only at dinner he had up the
      brandy-bottle, and finished it; and he did not have up Jacob, but he
      contrived to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day it rained incessantly. "Have you no books, Mrs. Goodyer?"
      asked poor John Burley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, some that the dear lady left behind her; and perhaps you would
      like to look at some papers in her own writing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not the papers,&mdash;all women scribble, and all scribble the same
      things. Get me the books."
    </p>
    <p>
      The books were brought up,&mdash;poetry and essays&mdash;John knew them by
      heart. He looked out on the rain, and at evening the rain had ceased. He
      rushed to his hat and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nature, Nature!" he exclaimed, when he was out in the air and hurrying by
      the dripping hedgerows, "you are not to be coaxed by me! I have jilted you
      shamefully, I own it; you are a female, and unforgiving. I don't complain.
      You may be very pretty, but you are the stupidest and most tire some
      companion that ever I met with. Thank Heaven, I am not married to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus John Burley made his way into town, and paused at the first
      public-house. Out of that house he came with a jovial air, and on he
      strode towards the heart of London. Now he is in Leicester Square, and he
      gazes on the foreigners who stalk that region, and hums a tune; and now
      from yonder alley two forms emerge, and dog his careless footsteps; now
      through the maze of passages towards St. Martin's he threads his path,
      and, anticipating an orgy as he nears his favourite haunts, jingles the
      silver in his pockets; and now the two forms are at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hail to thee, O Freedom!" muttered John Burley, "thy dwelling is in
      cities, and thy palace is the tavern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the king's name," quoth a gruff voice; and John Burley feels the
      horrid and familiar tap on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two bailiffs who dogged have seized their prey. "At whose suit?" asked
      John Burley, falteringly. "Mr. Cox, the wine-merchant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cox! A man to whom I gave a check on my bankers not three months ago!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it war n't cashed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that signify?&mdash;the intention was the same. A good heart
      takes the will for the deed. Cox is a monster of ingratitude, and I
      withdraw my custom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sarve him right. Would your honour like a jarvey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather spend the money on something else," said John Burley.
      "Give me your arm, I am not proud. After all, thank Heaven, I shall not
      sleep in the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      And John Burley made a night of it in the Fleet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Miss Starke was one of those ladies who pass their lives in the direst of
      all civil strife,&mdash;war with their servants. She looked upon the
      members of that class as the unrelenting and sleepless enemies of the
      unfortunate householders condemned to employ them. She thought they ate
      and drank to their villanous utmost, in order to ruin their benefactors;
      that they lived in one constant conspiracy with one another and the
      tradesmen, the object of which was to cheat and pilfer. Miss Starke was a
      miserable woman. As she had no relations or friends who cared enough for
      her to share her solitary struggle against her domestic foes; and her
      income, though easy, was an annuity that died with herself, thereby
      reducing various nephews, nieces, or cousins to the strict bounds of a
      natural affection,&mdash;that did not exist; and as she felt the want of
      some friendly face amidst this world of distrust and hate,&mdash;so she
      had tried the resource of venal companions. But the venal companions had
      never stayed long, either they disliked Miss Starke, or Miss Starke
      disliked them. Therefore the poor woman had resolved upon bringing up some
      little girl, whose heart, as she said to herself, would be fresh and
      uncorrupted, and from whom she might expect gratitude. She had been
      contented, on the whole, with Helen, and had meant to keep that child in
      her house as long as she (Miss Starke) remained upon the earth,&mdash;perhaps
      some thirty years longer; and then, having carefully secluded her from
      marriage and other friendship, to leave her nothing but the regret of
      having lost so kind a benefactress. Conformably with this notion, and in
      order to secure the affections of the child, Miss Starke had relaxed the
      frigid austerity natural to her manner and mode of thought, and been kind
      to Helen in an iron way. She had neither slapped nor pinched her, neither
      had she starved. She had allowed her to see Leonard, according to the
      agreement made with Dr. Morgan, and had laid out tenpence on cakes,
      besides contributing fruit from her garden for the first interview,&mdash;a
      hospitality she did not think it fit to renew on subsequent occasions. In
      return for this, she conceived she had purchased the right to Helen bodily
      and spiritually, and nothing could exceed her indignation when she rose
      one morning and found the child had gone. As it never had occurred to her
      to ask Leonard's address, though she suspected Helen had gone to him, she
      was at a loss what to do, and remained for twenty-four hours in a state of
      inane depression. But then she began to miss the child so much that her
      energies woke, and she persuaded herself that she was actuated by the
      purest benevolence in trying to reclaim this poor creature from the world
      into which Helen had thus rashly plunged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly she put an advertisement into the "Times," to the following
      effect, liberally imitated from one by which in former years she had
      recovered a favourite Blenheim:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              TWO GUINEAS' REWARD.

   STRAYED, from Ivy Cottage, Highgate, a Little Girl,&mdash;answers to the
   name of Helen; with blue eyes and brown hair; white muslin frock,
   and straw hat with blue ribbons. Whoever will bring the same to Ivy
   Cottage, shall receive the above Reward.

   N. B.&mdash;Nothing more will be offered.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that Mrs. Smedley had put an advertisement in the
      "Times" on her own account, relative to a niece of hers who was coming
      from the country, and for whom she desired to find a situation. So,
      contrary to her usual habit, she sent for the newspaper, and close by her
      own advertisement, she saw Miss Starke's.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible that she could mistake the description of Helen; and as
      this advertisement caught her eye the very day after the whole house had
      been disturbed and scandalized by Burley's noisy visit, and on which she
      had resolved to get rid of a lodger who received such visitors, the
      good-hearted woman was delighted to think that she could restore Helen to
      some safe home. While thus thinking, Helen herself entered the kitchen
      where Mrs. Smedley sat, and the landlady had the imprudence to point out
      the advertisement, and talk, as she called it, "seriously," to the little
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen in vain and with tears entreated her to take no step in reply to the
      advertisement. Mrs. Smedley felt that it was an affair of duty, and was
      obdurate, and shortly afterwards put on her bonnet and left the house.
      Helen conjectured that she was on her way to Miss Starke's, and her whole
      soul was bent on flight. Leonard had gone to the office of the "Beehive"
      with his manuscripts; but she packed up all their joint effects, and just
      as she had done so, he returned. She communicated the news of the
      advertisement, and said she should be so miserable if compelled to go back
      to Miss Starke's, and implored him so pathetically to save her from such
      sorrow, that he at once assented to her proposal of flight. Luckily,
      little was owing to the landlady,&mdash;that little was left with the
      maid-servant; and, profiting by Mrs. Smedley's absence, they escaped
      without scene or conflict. Their effects were taken by Leonard to a stand
      of hackney vehicles, and then left at a coach-office while they went in
      search of lodgings. It was wise to choose an entirely new and remote
      district; and before night they were settled in an attic in Lambeth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the reader will expect, no trace of Burley could Leonard find: the
      humourist had ceased to communicate with the "Beehive." But Leonard
      grieved for Burley's sake; and, indeed, he missed the intercourse of the
      large, wrong mind. But he settled down by degrees to the simple, loving
      society of his child companion, and in that presence grew more tranquil.
      The hours in the daytime that he did not pass at work, he spent as before,
      picking up knowledge at book-stalls; and at dusk he and Helen would stroll
      out,&mdash;sometimes striving to escape from the long suburb into fresh
      rural air; more often wandering to and fro the bridge that led to glorious
      Westminster&mdash;London's classic land&mdash;and watching the vague lamps
      reflected on the river. This haunt suited the musing, melancholy boy. He
      would stand long and with wistful silence by the balustrade, seating Helen
      thereon, that she too might look along the dark mournful waters, which,
      dark though they be, still have their charm of mysterious repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the river flowed between the world of roofs, and the roar of human
      passions on either side, so in those two hearts flowed Thought&mdash;and
      all they knew of London was its shadow.

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There appeared in the "Beehive" certain very truculent political papers,&mdash;papers
      very like the tracts in the tinker's bag. Leonard did not heed them much,
      but they made far more sensation in the public that read the "Beehive"
      than Leonard's papers, full of rare promise though the last were. They
      greatly increased the sale of the periodical in the manufacturing towns,
      and began to awake the drowsy vigilance of the Home Office. Suddenly a
      descent was made upon the "Beehive" and all its papers and plant. The
      editor saw himself threatened with a criminal prosecution, and the
      certainty of two years' imprisonment: he did not like the prospect, and
      disappeared. One evening, when Leonard, unconscious of these mischances,
      arrived at the door of the office, he found it closed. An agitated mob was
      before it, and a voice that was not new to his ear was haranguing the
      bystanders, with many imprecations against "tyrants." He looked, and, to
      his amaze, recognized in the orator Mr. Sprott the Tinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The police came in numbers to disperse the crowd, and Mr. Sprott prudently
      vanished. Leonard learned, then, what had befallen, and again saw himself
      without employment and the means of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he walked back. "O knowledge, knowledge!&mdash;powerless, indeed!"
      he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he thus spoke, a handbill in large capitals met his eyes on a dead
      wall, "Wanted, a few smart young men for India."
    </p>
    <p>
      A crimp accosted him. "You would make a fine soldier, my man. You have
      stout limbs of your own." Leonard moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has come back then to this,&mdash;brute physical force after all! O
      Mind, despair! O Peasant, be a machine again!" He entered his attic
      noiselessly, and gazed upon Helen as she sat at work, straining her eyes
      by the open window&mdash;with tender and deep compassion. She had not
      heard him enter, nor was she aware of his presence. Patient and still she
      sat, and the small fingers plied busily. He gazed, and saw that her cheek
      was pale and hollow, and the hands looked so thin! His heart was deeply
      touched, and at that moment he had not one memory of the baffled Poet, one
      thought that proclaimed the Egotist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached her gently, laid his hand on her shoulder, "Helen, put on
      your shawl and bonnet, and walk out,&mdash;I have much to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments she was ready, and they took their way to their favourite
      haunt upon the bridge. Pausing in one of the recesses, or nooks, Leonard
      then began, "Helen, we must part!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Part?&mdash;Oh, brother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen. All work that depends on mind is over for me, nothing remains but
      the labour of thews and sinews. I cannot go back to my village and say to
      all, 'My hopes were self-conceit, and my intellect a delusion!' I cannot.
      Neither in this sordid city can I turn menial or porter. I might be born
      to that drudgery, but my mind has, it may be unhappily, raised me above my
      birth. What, then, shall I do? I know not yet,&mdash;serve as a soldier,
      or push my way to some wilderness afar, as an emigrant, perhaps. But
      whatever my choice, I must henceforth be alone; I have a home no more. But
      there is a home for you, Helen, a very humble one (for you too, so well
      born), but very safe,&mdash;the roof of&mdash;of&mdash;my peasant mother.
      She will love you for my sake, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen clung to him trembling, and sobbed out, "Anything, anything you
      will. But I can work; I can make money, Leonard. I do, indeed, make money,&mdash;you
      do not know how much, but enough for us both till better times come to
      you. Do not let us part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I&mdash;a man, and born to labour&mdash;to be maintained by the work
      of an infant! No, Helen, do not so degrade me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back as she looked on his flushed brow, bowed her head
      submissively, and murmured, "Pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Helen, after a pause, "if now we could but find my poor
      father's friend! I never so much cared for it before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he would surely provide for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me!" repeated Helen, in a tone of soft, deep reproach, and she turned
      away her head to conceal her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sure you would remember him, if we met him by chance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. He was so different from all we see in this terrible city, and
      his eyes were like yonder stars, so clear and so bright; yet the light
      seemed to come from afar off, as the light does in yours, when your
      thoughts are away from all things round you. And then, too, his dog, whom
      he called Nero&mdash;I could not forget that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But his dog may not be always with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the bright clear eyes are! Ah, now you look up to heaven, and yours
      seem to dream like his."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard did not answer, for his thoughts were indeed less on earth than
      struggling to pierce into that remote and mysterious heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were silent long; the crowd passed them by unheedingly. Night
      deepened over the river, but the reflection of the lamp-lights on its
      waves was more visible than that of the stars. The beams showed the
      darkness of the strong current; and the craft that lay eastward on the
      tide, with sail-less spectral masts and black dismal hulks, looked
      death-like in their stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard looked down, and the thought of Chatterton's grim suicide came
      back to his soul; and a pale, scornful face, with luminous haunting eyes,
      seemed to look up from the stream, and murmur from livid lips, "Struggle
      no more against the tides on the surface,&mdash;all is calm and rest
      within the deep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in terror from the gloom of his revery, the boy began to talk
      fast to Helen, and tried to soothe her with descriptions of the lowly home
      which he had offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of the light cares which she would participate with his mother
      (for by that name he still called the widow), and dwelt, with an eloquence
      that the contrast round him made sincere and strong, on the happy rural
      life, the shadowy woodlands, the rippling cornfields, the solemn, lone
      churchspire soaring from the tranquil landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flatteringly he painted the flowery terraces of the Italian exile, and the
      playful fountain that, even as he spoke, was flinging up its spray to the
      stars, through serene air untroubled by the smoke of cities, and untainted
      by the sinful sighs of men. He promised her the love and protection of
      natures akin to the happy scene: the simple, affectionate mother, the
      gentle pastor, the exile wise and kind, Violante, with dark eyes full of
      the mystic thoughts that solitude calls from childhood,&mdash;Violante
      should be her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, oh!" cried Helen, "if life be thus happy there, return with me,
      return! return!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" murmured the boy, "if the hammer once strike the spark from the
      anvil, the spark must fly upward; it cannot fall back to earth until light
      has left it. Upward still, Helen,&mdash;let me go upward still!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Helen was very ill,&mdash;so ill that, shortly after
      rising, she was forced to creep back to bed. Her frame shivered, her eyes
      were heavy, her hand burned like fire. Fever had set in. Perhaps she might
      have caught cold on the bridge, perhaps her emotions had proved too much
      for her frame. Leonard, in great alarm, called in the nearest apothecary.
      The apothecary looked grave, and said there was danger. And danger soon
      declared itself,&mdash;Helen became delirious. For several days she lay in
      this state, be tween life and death. Leonard then felt that all the
      sorrows of earth are light, compared with the fear of losing what we love.
      How valueless the envied laurel seemed beside the dying rose!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks, perhaps, more to his heed and tending than to medical skill, she
      recovered sense at last. Immediate peril was over; but she was very weak
      and reduced, her ultimate recovery doubtful, convalescence, at best,
      likely to be very slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she learned how long she had been thus ill, she looked anxiously
      at Leonard's face as he bent over her, and faltered forth, "Give me my
      work; I am strong enough for that now,&mdash;it would amuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! he had no work himself; all their joint money had melted away. The
      apothecary was not like good Dr. Morgan; the medicines were to be paid
      for, and the rent. Two days before, Leonard had pawned Riccabocca's watch;
      and when the last shilling thus raised was gone, how should he support
      Helen? Nevertheless he conquered his tears, and assured her that he had
      employment; and that so earnestly that she believed him, and sank into
      soft sleep. He listened to her breathing, kissed her forehead, and left
      the room. He turned into his own neighbouring garret, and leaning his face
      on his hands, collected all his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must be a beggar at last. He must write to Mr. Dale for money,&mdash;Mr.
      Dale, too, who knew the secret of his birth. He would rather have begged
      of a stranger; it seemed to add a new dishonour to his mother's memory for
      the child to beg of one who was acquainted with her shame. Had he himself
      been the only one to want and to starve, he would have sunk inch by inch
      into the grave of famine, before he would have so subdued his pride. But
      Helen, there on that bed,&mdash;Helen needing, for weeks perhaps, all
      support, and illness making luxuries themselves like necessaries! Beg he
      must. And when he so resolved, had you but seen the proud, bitter soul he
      conquered, you would have said, "This, which he thinks is degradation,&mdash;this
      is heroism." Oh, strange human heart! no epic ever written achieves the
      Sublime and the Beautiful which are graven, unread by human eye, in thy
      secret leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of whom else should he beg? His mother had nothing, Riccabocca was poor,
      and the stately Violante, who had exclaimed, "Would that I were a man! "&mdash;he
      could not endure the thought that she should pity him and despise. The
      Avenels! No,&mdash;thrice No. He drew towards him hastily ink and paper,
      and wrote rapid lines that were wrung from him as from the bleeding
      strings of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hour for the post had passed, the letter must wait till the next
      day; and three days at least would elapse before he could receive an
      answer. He left the letter on the table, and, stifling as for air, went
      forth. He crossed the bridge, he passed on mechanically, and was borne
      along by a crowd pressing towards the doors of parliament. A debate that
      excited popular interest was fixed for that evening, and many bystanders
      collected in the street to see the members pass to and fro, or hear what
      speakers had yet risen to take part in the debate, or try to get orders
      for the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He halted amidst these loiterers, with no interest, indeed, in common with
      them, but looking over their heads abstractedly towards the tall Funeral
      Abbey,&mdash;imperial Golgotha of Poets and Chiefs and Kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his attention was diverted to those around by the sound of a
      name, displeasingly known to him. "How are you, Randal Leslie? coming to
      hear the debate?" said a member, who was passing through the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; Mr. Egerton promised to get me under the gallery. He is to speak
      himself to-night, and I have never heard him. As you are going into the
      House, will you remind him of his promise to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't now, for he is speaking already,&mdash;and well too. I hurried
      from the Athenaeum, where I was dining, on purpose to be in time, as I
      heard that his speech was making a great effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very unlucky," said Randal. "I had no idea he would speak so
      early."
    </p>
    <p>
      "C&mdash;&mdash;- brought him up by a direct personal attack. But follow
      me; perhaps I can get you into the House; and a man like you, Leslie, from
      whom we expect great things some day, I can tell you, should not miss any
      such opportunity of knowing what this House of ours is on a field-night.
      Come on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The member hurried towards the door; and as Randal followed him, a
      bystander cried, "That is the young man who wrote the famous pamphlet,&mdash;Egerton's
      relation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed!" said another. "Clever man, Egerton,&mdash;I am waiting for
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you are not a constituent, as I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but he has been very kind to my nephew, and I must thank him. You are
      a constituent&mdash;he is an honour to your town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he is: enlightened man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so generous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brings forward really good measures," quoth the politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And clever young men," said the uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewith one or two others joined in the praise of Audley Egerton, and
      many anecdotes of his liberality were told. Leonard listened at first
      listlessly, at last with thoughtful attention. He had heard Burley, too,
      speak highly of this generous statesman, who, without pretending to genius
      himself, appreciated it in others. He suddenly remembered, too, that
      Egerton was half-brother to the squire. Vague notions of some appeal to
      this eminent person, not for charity, but employment to his mind, gleamed
      across him,&mdash;inexperienced boy that he yet was! And while thus
      meditating, the door of the House opened and out came Audley Egerton
      himself. A partial cheering, followed by a general murmur, apprised
      Leonard of the presence of the popular statesman. Egerton was caught hold
      of by some five or six persons in succession; a shake of the hand, a nod,
      a brief whispered word or two, sufficed the practised member for graceful
      escape; and soon, free from the crowd, his tall, erect figure passed on,
      and turned towards the bridge. He paused at the angle and took out his
      watch, looking at it by the lamp-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley will be here soon," he muttered,&mdash;"he is always punctual; and
      now that I have spoken, I can give him an hour or so. That is well."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he replaced his watch in his pocket and re-buttoned his coat over his
      firm, broad chest, he lifted his eyes, and saw a young man standing before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want me?" asked the statesman, with the direct brevity of his
      practical character.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Egerton," said the young man, with a voice that slightly trembled and
      yet was manly amidst emotion, "you have a great name, and great power; I
      stand here in these streets of London without a friend, and without
      employment. I believe that I have it in me to do some nobler work than
      that of bodily labour, had I but one friend,&mdash;one opening for my
      thoughts. And now I have said this, I scarcely know how, or why, but from
      despair, and the sudden impulse which that despair took from the praise
      that follows your success, I have nothing more to add."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley Egerton was silent for a moment, struck by the tone and address of
      the stranger; but the consummate and wary man of the world, accustomed to
      all manner of strange applications and all varieties of imposture, quickly
      recovered from a passing and slight effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a native of?" (naming the town which the statesman represented).
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, young man, I am very sorry for you; but the good sense you must
      possess (for I judge of that by the education you have evidently received)
      must tell you that a public man, whatever be his patronage, has it too
      fully absorbed by claimants who have a right to demand it, to be able to
      listen to strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, and as Leonard stood silent, added with more kindness
      than most public men so accosted would have shown,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say you are friendless,&mdash;poor fellow! In early life that happens
      to many of us, who find friends enough before the close. Be honest, and
      well-conducted: lean on yourself, not on strangers; work with the body if
      you can't with the mind; and, believe me, that advice is all I can give
      you, unless this trifle"&mdash;and the minister held out a crown-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard bowed, shook his head sadly, and walked away. Egerton looked after
      him with a slight pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" said he to himself, "there must be thousands in the same state in
      these streets of London. I cannot redress the necessities of civilization.
      Well educated! It is not from ignorance henceforth that society will
      suffer,&mdash;it is from over-educating the hungry thousands who, thus
      unfitted for manual toil, and with no career for mental, will some day or
      other stand like that boy in our streets, and puzzle wiser ministers than
      I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Egerton thus mused, and passed on to the bridge, a bugle-horn rang
      merrily from the box of a gay four-in-hand. A drag-coach with superb
      blood-horses rattled over the causeway, and in the driver Egerton
      recognized his nephew, Frank Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Guardsman was returning with a lively party of men from dining
      at Greenwich, and the careless laughter of these children of pleasure
      floated far over the still river; it vexed the ear of the careworn
      statesman,&mdash;sad, perhaps, with all his greatness, lonely amidst all
      his crowd of friends. It reminded him, perhaps, of his own youth, when
      such parties and companionships were familiar to him, though through them
      all he had borne an ambitious, aspiring soul. "Le jeu vaut-il la
      chandelle?" said he, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach rolled rapidly past Leonard, as he stood leaning against the
      corner of the bridge, and the mire of the kennel splashed over him from
      the hoofs of the fiery horses. The laughter smote on his ear more
      discordantly than on the minister's, but it begot no envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life is a dark riddle," said he, smiting his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he walked slowly on, gained the recess where he had stood several
      nights before with Helen, and, dizzy with want of food, and worn out for
      want of sleep, he sank down into the dark corner; while the river that
      rolled under the arch of stone muttered dirge-like in his ear,&mdash;as
      under the social key-stone wails and rolls on forever the mystery of Human
      Discontent. Take comfort, O Thinker by the stream! 'T is the river that
      founded and gave pomp to the city; and, without the discontent, where were
      progress, what were Man? Take comfort, O THINKER! wherever the stream over
      which thou bendest, or beside which thou sinkest, weary and desolate,
      frets the arch that supports thee, never dream that, by destroying the
      bridge, thou canst silence the moan of the wave!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before a table, in the apartments appropriated to him in his father's
      house at Knightsbridge, sat Lord L'Estrange, sorting or destroying letters
      and papers,&mdash;an ordinary symptom of change of residence. There are
      certain trifles by which a shrewd observer may judge of a man's
      disposition. Thus, ranged on the table, with some elegance, but with
      soldier-like precision, were sundry little relics of former days, hallowed
      by some sentiment of memory, or perhaps endeared solely by custom; which,
      whether he was in Egypt, Italy, or England, always made part of the
      furniture of Harley's room. Even the small, old-fashioned, and somewhat
      inconvenient inkstand into which he dipped the pen as he labelled the
      letters he put aside, belonged to the writing-desk which had been his
      pride as a schoolboy. Even the books that lay scattered round were not new
      works, not those to which we turn to satisfy the curiosity of an hour, or
      to distract our graver thoughts; they were chiefly either Latin or Italian
      poets, with many a pencil-mark on the margin; or books which, making
      severe demand on thought, require slow and frequent perusal, and become
      companions. Somehow or other, in remarking that even in dumb, inanimate
      things the man was averse to change, and had the habit of attaching
      himself to whatever was connected with old associations, you might guess
      that he clung with pertinacity to affections more important, and you could
      better comprehend the freshness of his friendship for one so dissimilar in
      pursuits and character as Audley Egerton. An affection once admitted into
      the heart of Harley L'Estrange seemed never to be questioned or reasoned
      with; it became tacitly fixed, as it were, into his own nature, and little
      less than a revolution of his whole system could dislodge or disturb it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange's hand rested now upon a letter in a stiff, legible
      Italian character, and instead of disposing of it at once as he had done
      with the rest, he spread it before him, and re-read the contents. It was a
      letter from Riccabocca, received a few weeks since, and ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      LETTER FROM SIGNOR RICCABOCCA TO LORD L'ESTRANGE.
</pre>
    <p>
      I thank you, my noble friend, for judging of me with faith in my honour,
      and respect for my reverses.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, and thrice no, to all concessions, all overtures, all treaty with
      Giulio Franzini. I write the name, and my emotions choke me. I must pause,
      and cool back into disdain. It is over. Pass from that subject. But you
      have alarmed me. This sister! I have not seen her since her childhood; but
      she was brought up under his influence,
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;she can but work as his agent. She wish to learn my residence! It
      can be but for some hostile and malignant purpose. I may trust in you,&mdash;I
      know that. You say I may trust equally in the discretion of your friend.
      Pardon me,&mdash;my confidence is not so elastic. A word may give the clew
      to my retreat. But, if discovered, what harm can ensue? An English roof
      protects me from Austrian despotism: true; but not the brazen tower of
      Danae could protect me from Italian craft. And, were there nothing worse,
      it would be intolerable to me to live under the eyes of a relentless spy.
      Truly saith our proverb, 'He sleeps ill for whom the enemy wakes.' Look
      you, my friend, I have done with my old life,&mdash;I wish to cast it from
      me as a snake its skin. I have denied myself all that exiles deem
      consolation. No pity for misfortune, no messages from sympathizing
      friendship, no news from a lost and bereaved country follow me to my
      hearth under the skies of the stranger. From all these I have voluntarily
      cut thyself off. I am as dead to the life I once lived as if the Styx
      rolled between it and me. With that sternness which is admissible only to
      the afflicted, I have denied myself even the consolation of your visits. I
      have told you fairly and simply that your presence would unsettle all my
      enforced and infirm philosophy, and remind me only of the past, which I
      seek to blot from remembrance. You have complied on the one condition,
      that whenever I really want your aid I will ask it; and, meanwhile, you
      have generously sought to obtain me justice from the cabinets of ministers
      and in the courts of kings. I did not refuse your heart this luxury; for I
      have a child&mdash;Ah! I have taught that child already to revere your
      name, and in her prayers it is not forgotten. But now that you are
      convinced that even your zeal is unavailing, I ask you to discontinue
      attempts which may but bring the spy upon my track, and involve me in new
      misfortunes. Believe me, O brilliant Englishman, that I am satisfied and
      contented with my lot. I am sure it would not be for my happiness to
      change it, 'Chi non ha provato il male non conosce il bone.'
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   ["One does not know when one is well off till one has known
   misfortune."]
</pre>
    <p>
      You ask me how I live,&mdash;I answer, alla giornata,&mdash;[To the day]&mdash;not
      for the morrow, as I did once. I have accustomed myself to the calm
      existence of a village. I take interest in its details. There is my wife,
      good creature, sitting opposite to me, never asking what I write, or to
      whom, but ready to throw aside her work and talk the moment the pen is out
      of my hand. Talk&mdash;and what about? Heaven knows! But I would rather
      hear that talk, though on the affairs of a hamlet, than babble again with
      recreant nobles and blundering professors about commonwealths and
      constitutions. When I want to see how little those last influence the
      happiness of wise men, have I not Machiavelli and Thucydides? Then, by and
      by, the parson will drop in, and we argue. He never knows when he is
      beaten, so the argument is everlasting. On fine days I ramble out by a
      winding rill with my Violante, or stroll to my friend the squire's, and
      see how healthful a thing is true pleasure; and on wet days I shut myself
      up, and mope, perhaps till, hark! a gentle tap at the door, and in comes
      Violante, with her dark eyes, that shine out through reproachful tears,&mdash;reproachful
      that I should mourn alone, while she is under my roof; so she puts her
      arms round me, and in five minutes all is sunshine within. What care we
      for your English gray clouds without?
    </p>
    <p>
      Leave me, my dear Lord,&mdash;leave me to this quiet happy passage towards
      old age, serener than the youth that I wasted so wildly; and guard well
      the secret on which my happiness depends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to yourself, before I close. Of that same yourself you speak too
      little, as of me too much. But I so well comprehend the profound
      melancholy that lies underneath the wild and fanciful humour with which
      you but suggest, as in sport, what you feel so in earnest. The laborious
      solitude of cities weighs on you. You are flying back to the dolce far
      niente,&mdash;to friends few, but intimate; to life monotonous, but
      unrestrained; and even there the sense of loneliness will again seize upon
      you; and you do not seek, as I do, the annihilation of memory,&mdash;your
      dead passions are turned to ghosts that haunt you, and unfit you for the
      living world. I see it all,&mdash;I see it still, in your hurried
      fantastic lines, as I saw it when we two sat amidst the pines and beheld
      the blue lake stretched below, I troubled by the shadow of the Future, you
      disturbed by that of the Past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, but you say, half seriously, half in jest, "I will escape from this
      prison-house of memory; I will form new ties, like other men, and before
      it be too late; I will marry. Ay, but I must love,&mdash;there is the
      difficulty." Difficulty,&mdash;yes, and Heaven be thanked for it! Recall
      all the unhappy marriages that have come to your knowledge: pray, have not
      eighteen out of twenty been marriages for Love? It always has been so, and
      it always will; because, whenever we love deeply, we exact so much and
      forgive so little. Be content to find some one with whom your hearth and
      your honour are safe. You will grow to love what never wounds your heart,
      you will soon grow out of love with what must always disappoint your
      imagination. Cospetto! I wish my Jemima had a younger sister for you. Yet
      it was with a deep groan that I settled myself to a&mdash;Jemima.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I have written you a long letter, to prove how little I need of your
      compassion or your zeal. Once more let there be long silence between us.
      It is not easy for me to correspond with a man of your rank, and not incur
      the curious gossip of my still little pool of a world which the splash of
      a pebble can break into circles. I must take this over to a post-town some
      ten miles off, and drop it into the box by stealth. Adieu, dear and noble
      friend, gentlest heart and subtlest fancy that I have met in my walk
      through life. Adieu. Write me word when you have abandoned a day-dream and
      found a Jemima.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    ALPHONSO.
</pre>
    <p>
      P. S.&mdash;For Heaven's sake, caution and recaution your friend the
      minister not to drop a word to this woman that may betray my hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he really happy?" murmured Harley, as he closed the letter; and he
      sank for a few moments into a revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This life in a village, this wife in a lady who puts down her work to
      talk about villagers&mdash;what a contrast to Audley's full existence! And
      I cannot envy nor comprehend either! yet my own existence&mdash;what is
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and moved towards the window, from which a rustic stair descended
      to a green lawn, studded with larger trees than are often found in the
      grounds of a suburban residence. There were calm and coolness in the
      sight, and one could scarcely have supposed that London lay so near.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened softly, and a lady past middle age entered, and
      approaching Harley, as he still stood musing by the window, laid her hand
      on his shoulder. What character there is in a hand! Hers was a hand that
      Titian would have painted with elaborate care! Thin, white, and delicate,
      with the blue veins raised from the surface. Yet there was something more
      than mere patrician elegance in the form and texture. A true physiologist
      would have said at once, "There are intellect and pride in that hand,
      which seems to fix a hold where it rests; and lying so lightly, yet will
      not be as lightly shaken off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley," said the lady&mdash;and Harley turned&mdash;"you do not deceive
      me by that smile," she continued sadly; "you were not smiling when I
      entered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rarely that we smile to ourselves, my dear mother; and I have done
      nothing lately so foolish as to cause me to smile at myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son," said Lady Lansmere, somewhat abruptly, but with great
      earnestness, "you come from a line of illustrious ancestors; and methinks
      they ask from their tombs why the last of their race has no aim and no
      object, no interest, no home, in the land which they served, and which
      rewarded them with its honours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said the soldier, simply, "when the land was in danger I served
      it as my forefathers served,&mdash;and my answer would be the scars on my
      breast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it only in danger that a country is served, only in war that duty is
      fulfilled? Do you think that your father, in his plain, manly life of
      country gentleman, does not fulfil, though perhaps too obscurely, the
      objects for which aristocracy is created, and wealth is bestowed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless he does, ma'am,&mdash;and better than his vagrant son ever
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet his vagrant son has received such gifts from nature, his youth was so
      rich in promise, his boyhood so glowed at the dream of glory!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said Harley, very softly, "it is possible,&mdash;and all to be
      buried in a single grave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess started, and withdrew her hand from Harley's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lansmere's countenance was not one that much varied in expression.
      She had in this, as in her cast of feature, little resemblance to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her features were slightly aquiline,&mdash;the eyebrows of that arch which
      gives a certain majesty to the aspect; the lines round the mouth were
      habitually rigid and compressed. Her face was that of one who had gone
      through great emotion and subdued it. There was something formal, and even
      ascetic, in the character of her beauty, which was still considerable, in
      her air and in her dress. She might have suggested to you the idea of some
      Gothic baroness of old, half chatelaine, half-abbess; you would see at a
      glance that she did not live in the light world around her, and disdained
      its fashion and its mode of thought; yet with all this rigidity it was
      still the face of the woman who has known human ties and human affections.
      And now, as she gazed long on Harley's quiet, saddened brow, it was the
      face of a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A single grave," she said, after a long pause. "And you were then but a
      boy, Harley! Can such a memory influence you even to this day? It is
      scarcely possible: it does not seem to me within the realities of man's
      life,&mdash;though it might be of woman's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe," said Harley, half soliloquizing, "that I have a great deal of
      the woman in me. Perhaps men who live much alone, and care not for men's
      objects, do grow tenacious of impressions, as your sex does. But oh," he
      cried, aloud, and with a sudden change of countenance, "oh, the hardest
      and the coldest man would have felt as I do, had he known HER, had he
      loved HER. She was like no other woman I have ever met. Bright and
      glorious creature of another sphere! She descended on this earth and
      darkened it when she passed away. It is no use striving. Mother, I have as
      much courage as our steel-clad fathers ever had. I have dared in battle
      and in deserts, against man and the wild beast, against the storm and the
      ocean, against the rude powers of Nature,&mdash;dangers as dread as ever
      pilgrim or Crusader rejoiced to brave. But courage against that one
      memory! no, I have none!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley, Harley, you break my heart!" cried the countess, clasping her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is astonishing," continued her son, so rapt in his own thoughts that
      he did not, perhaps, hear her outcry. "Yea, verily, it is astonishing,
      that considering the thousands of women I have seen and spoken with, I
      never see a face like hers,&mdash;never hear a voice so sweet. And all
      this universe of life cannot afford me one look and one tone that can
      restore me to man's privilege,&mdash;love. Well, well, well, life has
      other things yet; Poetry and Art live still; still smiles the heaven and
      still wave the trees. Leave me to happiness in my own way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess was about to reply, when the door was thrown hastily open,
      and Lord Lansmere walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl was some years older than the countess, but his placid face
      showed less wear and tear,&mdash;a benevolent, kindly face, without any
      evidence of commanding intellect, but with no lack of sense in its
      pleasant lines; his form not tall, but upright and with an air of
      consequence,&mdash;a little pompous, but good-humouredly so,&mdash;the
      pomposity of the Grand Seigneur who has lived much in provinces, whose
      will has been rarely disputed, and whose importance has been so felt and
      acknowledged as to react insensibly on himself;&mdash;an excellent man;
      but when you glanced towards the high brow and dark eye of the countess,
      you marvelled a little how the two had come together, and, according to
      common report, lived so happily in the union.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, ho! my dear Harley," cried Lord Lansmere, rubbing his hands with an
      appearance of much satisfaction, "I have just been paying a visit to the
      duchess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What duchess, my dear father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, your mother's first cousin, to be sure,&mdash;the Duchess of
      Knaresborough, whom, to oblige me, you condescended to call upon; and
      delighted I am to hear that you admire Lady Mary&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is very high bred, and rather&mdash;high-nosed," answered Harley.
      Then, observing that his mother looked pained, and his father
      disconcerted, he added seriously, "But handsome certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Harley," said the earl, recovering himself, "the duchess, taking
      advantage of our connection to speak freely, has intimated to me that Lady
      Mary has been no less struck with yourself; and to come to the point,
      since you allow that it is time you should think of marrying, I do not
      know a more desirable alliance. What do you say, Katherine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The duke is of a family that ranks in history before the Wars of the
      Roses," said Lady Lansmere, with an air of deference to her husband; "and
      there has never been one scandal in its annals, nor one blot on its
      scutcheon. But I am sure my dear Lord must think that the duchess should
      not have made the first overture,&mdash;even to a friend and a kinsman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, we are old-fashioned people," said the earl, rather embarrassed,
      "and the duchess is a woman of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hope," said the countess, mildly, "that her daughter is not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not marry Lady Mary, if all the rest of the female sex were
      turned into apes," said Lord L'Estrange, with deliberate fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" cried the earl, "what extraordinary language is this? And
      pray why, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"I can't say; there is no why in these cases. But, my dear
      father, you are not keeping faith with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD LANSMERE.&mdash;"HOW?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"You and my Lady, here, entreat me to marry; I promise to do
      my best to obey you, but on one condition, that I choose for myself, and
      take my time about it. Agreed on both sides. Whereon, off goes your
      Lordship&mdash;actually before noon, at an hour when no lady, without a
      shudder, could think of cold blonde and damp orange flowers&mdash;off goes
      your Lordship, I say, and commits poor Lady Mary and your unworthy son to
      a mutual admiration,&mdash;which neither of us ever felt. Pardon me, my
      father, but this is grave. Again let me claim your promise,&mdash;full
      choice for myself, and no reference to the Wars of the Roses. What War of
      the Roses like that between Modesty and Love upon the cheek of the
      virgin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY LANSMERE.&mdash;"Full choice for yourself, Harley: so be it. But we,
      too, named a condition,&mdash;did we not, Lansmere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE EARL (puzzled).&mdash;"Eh, did we? Certainly we did."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY LANSMERE.&mdash;"The son of Lord Lansmere can only marry the daughter
      of a gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE EARL.&mdash;"Of course, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed over Harley's fair face, and then as suddenly left it
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked away to the window; his mother followed him, and again laid her
      hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were cruel," said he, gently, and in a whisper, as he winced under
      the touch of the hand. Then turning to the earl, who was gazing at him in
      blank surprise,&mdash;it never occurred to Lord Lansmere that there could
      be a doubt of his son's marrying beneath the rank modestly stated by the
      countess,&mdash;Harley stretched forth his hand, and said, in his soft
      winning tone, "You have ever been most gracious to me, and most
      forbearing; it is but just that I should sacrifice the habits of an
      egotist, to gratify a wish which you so warmly entertain. I agree with
      you, too, that our race should not close in me,&mdash;Noblesse oblige. But
      you know I was ever romantic; and I must love where I marry; or, if not
      love, I must feel that my wife is worthy of all the love I could once have
      bestowed. Now, as to the vague word 'gentleman' that my mother employs&mdash;word
      that means so differently on different lips&mdash;I confess that I have a
      prejudice against young ladies brought up in the 'excellent foppery of the
      world,' as the daughters of gentlemen of our rank mostly are. I crave,
      therefore, the most liberal interpretation of this word 'gentleman.' And
      so long as there be nothing mean or sordid in the birth, habits, and
      education of the father of this bride to be, I trust you will both agree
      to demand nothing more,&mdash;neither titles nor pedigree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Titles, no, assuredly," said Lady Lansmere; "they do not make gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said the earl; "many of our best families are untitled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Titles&mdash;no," repeated Lady Lansmere; "but ancestors yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my mother," said Harley, with his most sad and quiet smile, "it is
      fated that we shall never agree. The first of our race is ever the one we
      are most proud of; and pray, what ancestors had he? Beauty, virtue,
      modesty, intellect,&mdash;if these are not nobility enough for a man, he
      is a slave to the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words Harley took up his hat and made towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said yourself, 'Noblesse oblige,'" said the countess, following him
      to the threshold; "we have nothing more to add."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley slightly shrugged his shoulders, kissed his mother's hand; whistled
      to Nero, who started up from a doze by the window, and went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he really go abroad next week?" said the earl. "So he says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid there is no chance for Lady Mary," resumed Lord Lansmere,
      with a slight but melancholy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has not intellect enough to charm him. She is not worthy of Harley,"
      said the proud mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Between you and me," rejoined the earl, rather timidly, "I don't see what
      good his intellect does him. He could not be more unsettled and useless if
      he were the merest dunce in the three kingdoms. And so ambitious as he was
      when a boy! Katherine, I sometimes fancy that you know what changed him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! Nay, my dear Lord, it is a common change enough with the young, when
      of such fortunes, who find, when they enter life, that there is really
      little left for them to strive for. Had Harley been a poor man's son, it
      might have been different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was born to the same fortunes as Harley," said the earl, shrewdly, "and
      yet I flatter myself I am of some use to old England."
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess seized upon the occasion, complimented her Lord, and turned
      the subject.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harley spent his day in his usual desultory, lounging manner,&mdash;dined
      in his quiet corner at his favourite club. Nero, not admitted into the
      club, patiently waited for him outside the door. The dinner over, dog and
      man, equally indifferent to the crowd, sauntered down that thoroughfare
      which, to the few who can comprehend the Poetry of London, has
      associations of glory and of woe sublime as any that the ruins of the dead
      elder world can furnish,&mdash;thoroughfare that traverses what was once
      the courtyard of Whitehall, having to its left the site of the palace that
      lodged the royalty of Scotland; gains, through a narrow strait, that old
      isle of Thorney, in which Edward the Confessor received the ominous visit
      of the Conqueror; and, widening once more by the Abbey and the Hall of
      Westminster, then loses itself, like all memories of earthly grandeur,
      amidst humble passages and mean defiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus thought Harley L'Estrange&mdash;ever less amidst the actual world
      around him than the images invoked by his own solitary soul-as he gained
      the bridge, and saw the dull, lifeless craft sleeping on the "Silent Way,"
      once loud and glittering with the gilded barks of the antique Seignorie of
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on that bridge that Audley Egerton had appointed to meet
      L'Estrange, at an hour when he calculated he could best steal a respite
      from debate. For Harley, with his fastidious dislike to all the resorts of
      his equals, had declined to seek his friend in the crowded regions of
      Bellamy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley's eye, as he passed along the bridge, was attracted by a still
      form, seated on the stones in one of the nooks, with its face covered by
      its hands. "If I were a sculptor," said he to himself, "I should remember
      that image whenever I wished to convey the idea of Despondency!" He lifted
      his looks and saw, a little before him in the midst of the causeway, the
      firm, erect figure of Audley Egerton. The moonlight was full on the
      bronzed countenance of the strong public man, with its lines of thought
      and care, and its vigorous but cold expression of intense self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And looking yonder," continued Harley's soliloquy, "I should remember
      that form, when I wished to hew out from the granite the idea of
      Endurance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are come, and punctually," said Egerton, linking his arm in
      Harley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY&mdash;"Punctually, of course, for I respect your time, and I will
      not detain you long. I presume you will speak to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"I have spoken."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (with interest).&mdash;"And well, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"With effect, I suppose, for I have been loudly cheered,
      which does not always happen to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"And that gave you pleasure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (after a moment's thought).&mdash;"No, not the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"What, then, attaches you so much to this life,&mdash;constant
      drudgery, constant warfare, the more pleasurable faculties dormant, all
      the harsher ones aroused, if even its rewards (and I take the best of
      those to be applause) do not please you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"What? Custom."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Martyr."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"You say it: but turn to yourself; you have decided, then,
      to leave England next week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (moodily).&mdash;"Yes. This life in a capital, where all are so
      active, myself so objectless, preys on me like a low fever. Nothing here
      amuses me, nothing interests, nothing comforts and consoles. But I am
      resolved, before it be too late, to make one great struggle out of the
      Past, and into the natural world of men. In a word, I have resolved to
      marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (seriously).&mdash;"Upon my life, my dear fellow, you are a great
      philosopher. You have hit the exact question. You see I cannot marry a
      dream; and where, out of dreams, shall I find this 'whom'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"You do not search for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY. "Do we ever search for love? Does it not flash upon us when we
      least expect it? Is it not like the inspiration to the muse? What poet
      sits down and says, 'I will write a poem'? What man looks out and says, 'I
      will fall in love'? No! Happiness, as the great German tells us, 'falls
      suddenly from the bosom of the gods;' so does love."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"You remember the old line in Horace: 'The tide flows away
      while the boor sits on the margin and waits for the ford.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEV.&mdash;"An idea which incidentally dropped from you some weeks ago,
      and which I have before half-meditated, has since haunted me. If I could
      but find some child with sweet dispositions and fair intellect not yet
      formed, and train her up according to my ideal. I am still young enough to
      wait a few years. And meanwhile I shall have gained what I so sadly want,&mdash;an
      object in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"You are ever the child of romance. But what&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the minister was interrupted by a messenger from the House of
      Commons, whom Audley had instructed to seek him on the bridge should his
      presence be required. "Sir, the Opposition are taking advantage of the
      thinness of the House to call for a division. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;- is put
      up to speak for time, but they won't hear him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton turned hastily to Lord L'Estrange. "You see, you must excuse me
      now. To-morrow I must go to Windsor for two days: but we shall meet on my
      return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not matter," answered Harley; "I stand out of the pale of your
      advice, O practical man of sense. And if," added Harley, with affectionate
      and mournful sweetness,&mdash;"if I weary you with complaints which you
      cannot understand, it is only because of old schoolboy habits. I can have
      no trouble that I do not confide to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton's hand trembled as it pressed his friend's, and without a word, he
      hurried away abruptly. Harley remained motionless for some seconds, in
      deep and quiet revery; then he called to his dog, and turned back towards
      Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed the nook in which had sat the still figure of Despondency; but
      the figure had now risen, and was leaning against the balustrade. The dog,
      who preceded his master, passed by the solitary form and sniffed it
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nero, sir, come here," said Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nero,"&mdash;that was the name by which Helen had said that her father's
      friend had called his dog; and the sound startled Leonard as he leaned,
      sick at heart, against the stone. He lifted his head and looked wistfully,
      eagerly into Harley's face. Those eyes, bright, clear, yet so strangely
      deep and absent, which Helen had described, met his own, and chained them.
      For L'Estrange halted also; the boy's countenance was not unfamiliar to
      him. He returned the inquiring look fixed on his own, and recognized the
      student by the bookstall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dog is quite harmless, sir," said L'Estrange, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you call him 'Nero'?" said Leonard, still gazing on the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley mistook the drift of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nero, sir; but he is free from the sanguinary propensities of his Roman
      namesake." Harley was about to pass on, when Leonard said falteringly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, but can it be possible that you are one whom I have sought in
      vain on behalf of the child of Captain Digby?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley stopped short. "Digby!" he exclaimed, "where is he? He should have
      found me easily. I gave him an address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Heaven be thanked!" cried Leonard. "Helen is saved&mdash;she will not
      die," and he burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few moments and a very few words sufficed to explain to Harley the
      state of his old fellow-soldier's orphan. And Harley himself soon stood in
      the young sufferer's room, supporting her burning temples on his breast,
      and whispering into ears that heard him as in a happy dream, "Comfort,
      comfort; your father yet lives in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Helen, raising her eyes, said, "But Leonard is my brother&mdash;more
      than brother-and he needs a father's care more than I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, hush, Helen. I need no one, nothing now!" cried Leonard, and his
      tears gushed over the little hand that clasped his own.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harley L'Estrange was a man whom all things that belong to the romantic
      and poetic side of our human life deeply impressed. When he came to learn
      the ties between these two Children of Nature, standing side by side,
      alone amidst the storms of fate, his heart was more deeply moved than it
      had been for many years. In those dreary attics, overshadowed by the smoke
      and reek of the humble suburb, the workday world in its harshest and
      tritest forms below and around them, he recognized that divine poem which
      comes out from all union between the mind and the heart. Here, on the
      rough deal table (the ink scarcely dry), lay the writings of the young
      wrestler for fame and bread; there, on the other side of the partition, on
      that mean pallet, lay the boy's sole comforter, the all that warmed his
      heart with living mortal affection. On one side the wall, the world of
      imagination; on the other, this world of grief and of love. And in both, a
      spirit equally sublime,&mdash;unselfish devotion,&mdash;"the something
      afar from the sphere of our sorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the room into which he had followed Leonard, on quitting
      Helen's bedside. He noted the manuscripts on the table, and pointing to
      them, said gently, "And these are the labours by which you supported the
      soldier's orphan?&mdash;soldier yourself in a hard battle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The battle was lost,&mdash;I could not support her," replied Leonard,
      mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you did not desert her. When Pandora's box was opened, they say Hope
      lingered last&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "False, false," said Leonard; "a heathen's notion. There are deities that
      linger behind Hope,&mdash;Gratitude, Love, and Duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours is no common nature," exclaimed Harley, admiringly, "but I must
      sound it more deeply hereafter: at present I hasten for the physician; I
      shall return with him. We must move that poor child from this low close
      air as soon as possible. Meanwhile, let me qualify your rejection of the
      old fable. Wherever Gratitude, Love, and Duty remain to man, believe me
      that Hope is there too, though she may be often invisible, hidden behind
      the sheltering wings of the nobler deities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley said this with that wondrous smile of his, which cast a brightness
      over the whole room, and went away. Leonard stole softly towards the grimy
      window; and looking up towards the stars that shone pale over the
      roof-tops, he murmured, "O Thou, the All-seeing and All-merciful! how it
      comforts me now to think that, though my dreams of knowledge may have
      sometimes obscured the heavens, I never doubted that Thou wert there! as
      luminous and everlasting, though behind the cloud!" So, for a few minutes,
      he prayed silently, then passed into Helen's room, and sat beside her
      motionless, for she slept. She woke just as Harley returned with a
      physician; and then Leonard, returning to his own room, saw amongst his
      papers the letter he had written to Mr. Dale, and muttering, "I need not
      disgrace my calling,&mdash;I need not be the mendicant now"&mdash;held the
      letter to the flame of the candle. And while he said this, and as the
      burning tinder dropped on the floor, the sharp hunger, unfelt during his
      late anxious emotions, gnawed at his entrails. Still, even hunger could
      not reach that noble pride which had yielded to a sentiment nobler than
      itself, and he smiled as he repeated, "No mendicant!&mdash;the life that I
      was sworn to guard is saved. I can raise against Fate the front of Man
      once more."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days afterwards, and Helen, removed to a pure air, and under the
      advice of the first physicians, was out of all danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pretty detached cottage, with its windows looking over the wild
      heaths of Norwood, to which Harley rode daily to watch the convalescence
      of his young charge: an object in life was already found. As she grew
      better and stronger, he coaxed her easily into talking, and listened to
      her with pleased surprise. The heart so infantine and the sense so womanly
      struck him much by its rare contrast and combination. Leonard, whom he had
      insisted on placing also in the cottage, had stayed there willingly till
      Helen's recovery was beyond question. Then he came to Lord L'Estrange, as
      the latter was about one day to leave the cottage, and said quietly, "Now,
      my Lord, that Helen is safe, and now that she will need me no more, I can
      no longer be a pensioner on your bounty. I return to London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are my visitor, not my pensioner, foolish boy," said Harley, who had
      already noticed the pride which spoke in that farewell; "come into the
      garden and let us talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley seated himself on a bench on the little lawn; Nero crouched at his
      feet; Leonard stood beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," said Lord L'Estrange, "you would return to London? What to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fulfil my fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot guess. Fate is the Isis whose veil no mortal can ever raise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should be born for great things," said Harley, abruptly. "I am sure
      that you write well. I have seen that you study with passion. Better than
      writing and better than study, you have a noble heart, and the proud
      desire of independence. Let me see your manuscripts, or any copies of what
      you have already printed. Do not hesitate,&mdash;I ask but to be a reader.
      I don't pretend to be a patron: it is a word I hate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard's eyes sparkled through their sudden moisture. He brought out his
      portfolio, placed it on the bench beside Harley, and then went softly to
      the farther part of the garden. Nero looked after him, and then rose and
      followed him slowly. The boy seated himself on the turf, and Nero rested
      his dull head on the loud heart of the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley took up the various papers before him, and read them through
      leisurely. Certainly he was no critic. He was not accustomed to analyze
      what pleased or displeased him; but his perceptions were quick, and his
      taste exquisite. As he read, his countenance, always so genuinely
      expressive, exhibited now doubt and now admiration. He was soon struck by
      the contrast, in the boy's writings, between the pieces that sported with
      fancy and those that grappled with thought. In the first, the young poet
      seemed so unconscious of his own individuality. His imagination, afar and
      aloft from the scenes of his suffering, ran riot amidst a paradise of
      happy golden creations. But in the last, the THINKER stood out alone and
      mournful, questioning, in troubled sorrow, the hard world on which he
      gazed. All in the thought was unsettled, tumultuous; all in the fancy
      serene and peaceful. The genius seemed divided into twain shapes,&mdash;the
      one bathing its wings amidst the starry dews of heaven; the other
      wandering, "melancholy, slow," amidst desolate and boundless sands. Harley
      gently laid down the paper and mused a little while. Then he rose and
      walked to Leonard, gazing on his countenance as he neared the boy, with a
      new and a deeper interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have read your papers," he said, "and recognize in them two men,
      belonging to two worlds, essentially distinct." Leonard started, and
      murmured, "True, true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I apprehend," resumed Harley, "that one of these men must either destroy
      the other, or that the two must become fused and harmonized into a single
      existence. Get your hat, mount my groom's horse, and come with me to
      London; we will converse by the way. Look you, I believe you and I agree
      in this,&mdash;that the first object of every noble spirit is
      independence. It is towards this independence that I alone presume to
      assist you, and this is a service which the proudest man can receive
      without a blush."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard lifted his eyes towards Harley's, and those eyes swam with
      grateful tears; but his heart was too full to answer. "I am not one of
      those," said Harley, when they were on the road, "who think that because a
      young man writes poetry he is fit for nothing else, and that he must be a
      poet or a pauper. I have said that in you there seems to me to be two men,&mdash;the
      man of the Actual world, the man of the Ideal. To each of these men I can
      offer a separate career. The first is perhaps the more tempting. It is the
      interest of the State to draw into its service all the talent and industry
      it can obtain; and under his native State every citizen of a free country
      should be proud to take service. I have a friend who is a minister, and
      who is known to encourage talent,&mdash;Audley Egerton. I have but to say
      to him, 'There is a young man who will repay the government whatever the
      government bestows on him;' and you will rise to-morrow independent in
      means, and with fair occasions to attain to fortune and distinction. This
      is one offer,&mdash;what say you to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard thought bitterly of his interview with Audley Egerton, and the
      minister's proffered crown-piece. He shook his head, and replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my Lord, how have I deserved such kindness? Do with me what you will;
      but if I have the option, I would rather follow my own calling. This is
      not the ambition that inflames me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, then, the other offer. I have a friend with whom I am less intimate
      than Egerton, and who has nothing in his gift to bestow. I speak of a man
      of letters,&mdash;Henry Norreys,&mdash;of whom you have doubtless heard,
      who, I should say, conceived an interest in you when he observed you
      reading at the bookstall. I have often heard him say that literature as a
      profession is misunderstood, and that rightly followed, with the same
      pains and the same prudence which are brought to bear on other
      professions, a competence at least can be always ultimately obtained. But
      the way may be long and tedious, and it leads to no power but over
      thought; it rarely attains to wealth; and though reputation may be
      certain, fame, such as poets dream of, is the lot of few. What say you to
      this course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, I decide," said Leonard, firmly; and then, his young face
      lighting up with enthusiasm, he exclaimed, "Yes, if, as you say, there be
      two men within me, I feel that were I condemned wholly to the mechanical
      and practical world, one would indeed destroy the other. And the conqueror
      would be the ruder and the coarser. Let me pursue those ideas that, though
      they have but flitted across me, vague and formless, have ever soared
      towards the sunlight. No matter whether or not they lead to fortune or to
      fame,&mdash;at least they will lead me upward! Knowledge for itself I
      desire; what care I if it be not power!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," said Harley, with a pleased smile at his young companion's
      outburst. "As you decide so shall it be settled. And now permit me, if not
      impertinent, to ask you a few questions. Your name is Leonard Fairfield?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy blushed deeply, and bowed his head as if in assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen says you are self-taught; for the rest she refers me to you,&mdash;thinking,
      perhaps, that I should esteem you less&mdash;rather than yet more highly&mdash;if
      she said you were, as I presume to conjecture, of humble birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My birth," said Leonard, slowly, "is very&mdash;very&mdash;humble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The name of Fairfield is not unknown to me. There was one of that name
      who married into a family in Lansmere, married an Avenel," continued
      Harley, and his voice quivered. "You change countenance. Oh, could your
      mother's name have been Avenel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Leonard, between his set teeth. Harley laid his hand on the
      boy's shoulder. "Then, indeed, I have a claim on you; then, indeed, we are
      friends. I have a right to serve any of that family."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard looked at him in surprise&mdash;"For," continued Harley,
      recovering himself, "they always served my family; and my recollections of
      Lansmere, though boyish, are indelible." He spurred on his horse as the
      words closed, and again there was a long pause; but from that time Harley
      always spoke to Leonard in a soft voice, and often gazed on him with
      earnest and kindly eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached a house in a central, though not fashionable street. A
      man-servant of a singularly grave and awful aspect opened the door,&mdash;a
      man who had lived all his life with authors. Poor fellow, he was indeed
      prematurely old! The care on his lip and the pomp on his brow&mdash;no
      mortal's pen can describe!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Norreys at home?" asked Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is at home&mdash;to his friends, my Lord," answered the man,
      majestically; and he stalked across the hall with the step of a Dangeau
      ushering some Montmorenci into the presence of Louis le Grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay; show this gentleman into another room. I will go first into the
      library; wait for me, Leonard." The man nodded, and conducted Leonard into
      the dining-room. Then pausing before the door of the library, and
      listening an instant, as if fearful to disturb some mood of inspiration,
      opened it very softly. To his ineffable disgust, Harley pushed before, and
      entered abruptly. It was a large room, lined with books from the floor to
      the ceiling. Books were on all the tables, books were on all the chairs.
      Harley seated himself on a folio of Raleigh's "History of the World," and
      cried, "I have brought you a treasure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" said Norreys, good-humouredly, looking up from his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mind!" echoed Norreys, vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! I have none,&mdash;I have only a heart and a fancy. Listen. You
      remember the boy we saw reading at the book stall. I have caught him for
      you, and you shall train him into a man. I have the warmest interest in
      his future, for I know some of his family, and one of that family was very
      dear to me. As for money, he has not a shilling, and not a shilling would
      he accept gratis from you or me either. But he comes with bold heart to
      work,&mdash;and work you must find him." Harley then rapidly told his
      friend of the two offers he had made to Leonard, and Leonard's choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This promises very well; for letters a man must have a strong vocation,
      as he should have for law. I will do all that you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley rose with alertness, shook Norreys cordially by the hand, hurried
      out of the room, and returned with Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Norreys eyed the young man with attention. He was naturally rather
      severe than cordial in his manner to strangers,&mdash;contrasting in this,
      as in most things, the poor vagabond Burley; but he was a good judge of
      the human countenance, and he liked Leonard's. After a pause he held out
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said he, "Lord L'Estrange tells me that you wish to enter
      literature as a calling, and no doubt to study it as an art. I may help
      you in this, and you meanwhile can help me. I want an amanuensis,&mdash;I
      offer you that place. The salary will be proportioned to the services you
      will render me. I have a room in my house at your disposal. When I first
      came up to London, I made the same choice that I hear you have done. I
      have no cause, even in a worldly point of view, to repent my choice. It
      gave me an income larger than my wants. I trace my success to these
      maxims, which are applicable to all professions: 1st, Never to trust to
      genius for what can be obtained by labour; 2dly, Never to profess to teach
      what we have not studied to understand; 3dly, Never to engage our word to
      what we do not our best to execute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With these rules, literature&mdash;provided a man does not mistake his
      vocation for it, and will, under good advice, go through the preliminary
      discipline of natural powers, which all vocations require&mdash;is as good
      a calling as any other. Without them, a shoeblack's is infinitely better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly enough," muttered Harley; "but there have been great writers who
      observed none of your maxims."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great writers, probably, but very unenviable men. My Lord, my Lord, don't
      corrupt the pupil you bring to me." Harley smiled, and took his departure,
      and left Genius at school with Common-Sense and Experience.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Leonard Fairfield had been obscurely wrestling against poverty,
      neglect, hunger, and dread temptation, bright had been the opening day and
      smooth the upward path of Randal Leslie. Certainly no young man, able and
      ambitious, could enter life under fairer auspices; the connection and
      avowed favourite of a popular and energetic statesman, the brilliant
      writer of a political work that had lifted him at once into a station of
      his own, received and courted in those highest circles, to which neither
      rank nor fortune alone suffices for a familiar passport,&mdash;the circles
      above fashion itself the circles of POWER,&mdash;with every facility of
      augmenting information, and learning the world betimes through the talk of
      its acknowledged masters,&mdash;Randal had but to move straight onward,
      and success was sure. But his tortuous spirit delighted in scheme and
      intrigue for their own sake. In scheme and intrigue he saw shorter paths
      to fortune, if not to fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      His besetting sin was also his besetting weakness. He did not aspire,&mdash;he
      coveted. Though in a far higher social position than Frank Hazeldean,
      despite the worldly prospects of his old schoolfellow, he coveted the very
      things that kept Frank Hazeldean below him,&mdash;coveted his idle
      gayeties, his careless pleasures, his very waste of youth. Thus, also,
      Randal less aspired to Audley Egerton's repute than he coveted Audley
      Egerton's wealth and pomp, his princely expenditure, and his Castle
      Rackrent in Grosvenor Square. It was the misfortune of his birth to be so
      near to both these fortunes,&mdash;near to that of Leslie, as the future
      head of that fallen House; near even to that of Hazeldean, since, as we
      have seen before, if the squire had had no son, Randal's descent from the
      Hazeldeans suggested himself as the one on whom these broad lands should
      devolve. Most young men brought into intimate contact with Audley Egerton
      would have felt for that personage a certain loyal and admiring, if not
      very affectionate, respect. For there was something grand in Egerton,&mdash;something
      that commands and fascinates the young. His determined courage, his
      energetic will, his almost regal liberality, contrasting a simplicity in
      personal tastes and habits that was almost austere, his rare and seemingly
      unconscious power of charming even the women most wearied of homage, and
      persuading even the men most obdurate to counsel,&mdash;all served to
      invest the practical man with those spells which are usually confined to
      the ideal one. But, indeed, Audley Egerton was an Ideal,&mdash;the ideal
      of the Practical. Not the mere vulgar, plodding, red-tape machine of petty
      business, but the man of strong sense, inspired by inflexible energy and
      guided to definite earthly objects. In a dissolute and corrupt form of
      government, under a decrepit monarchy or a vitiated republic, Audley
      Egerton might have been a most dangerous citizen: for his ambition was so
      resolute, and his sight to its ends was so clear. But there is something
      in public life in England which compels the really ambitious man to
      honour, unless his eyes are jaundiced and oblique, like Randal Leslie's.
      It is so necessary in England to be a gentleman. And thus Egerton was
      emphatically considered a gentleman. Without the least pride in other
      matters, with little apparent sensitiveness, touch him on the point of
      gentleman, and no one so sensitive and so proud. As Randal saw more of
      him, and watched his moods with the lynx-eyes of the household spy, he
      could perceive that this hard mechanical man was subject to fits of
      melancholy, even of gloom; and though they did not last long, there was
      even in his habitual coldness an evidence of something compressed, latent,
      painful, lying deep within his memory. This would have interested the
      kindly feelings of a grateful heart; but Randal detected and watched it
      only as a clew to some secret it might profit him to gain. For Randal
      Leslie hated Egerton; and hated him the more because, with all his
      book-knowledge and his conceit in his own talents, he could not despise
      his patron; because he had not yet succeeded in making his patron the mere
      tool or stepping-stone; because he thought that Egerton's keen eye saw
      through his wily heart, even while, as if in profound disdain, the
      minister helped the protege. But this last suspicion was unsound. Egerton
      had not detected Leslie's corrupt and treacherous nature. He might have
      other reasons for keeping him at a certain distance, but he inquired too
      little into Randal's feelings towards himself to question the attachment,
      or doubt the sincerity, of one who owed to him so much. But that which
      more than all embittered Randal's feelings towards Egerton was the careful
      and deliberate frankness with which the latter had, more than once,
      repeated and enforced the odious announcement, that Randal had nothing to
      expect from the minister's WILL, nothing to expect from that wealth which
      glared in the hungry eyes of the pauper heir to the Leslies of Rood. To
      whom, then, could Egerton mean to devise his fortune? To whom but Frank
      Hazeldean? Yet Audley took so little notice of his nephew, seemed so
      indifferent to him, that that supposition, however natural, was exposed to
      doubt. The astuteness of Randal was perplexed. Meanwhile, however, the
      less he himself could rely upon Egerton for fortune, the more he revolved
      the possible chances of ousting Frank from the inheritance of Hazeldean,&mdash;in
      part, at least, if not wholly. To one less scheming, crafty, and
      remorseless than Randal Leslie, such a project would have seemed the
      wildest delusion. But there was something fearful in the manner in which
      this young man sought to turn knowledge into power, and make the study of
      all weakness in others subservient to his own ends. He wormed himself
      thoroughly into Frank's confidence. He learned, through Frank, all the
      squire's peculiarities of thought and temper, and pondered over each word
      in the father's letters, which the son gradually got into the habit of
      showing to the perfidious eyes of his friend. Randal saw that the squire
      had two characteristics, which are very common amongst proprietors, and
      which might be invoked as antagonists to his warm fatherly love. First,
      the squire was as fond of his estate as if it were a living thing, and
      part of his own flesh and blood; and in his lectures to Frank upon the sin
      of extravagance, the squire always let out this foible,&mdash;"What was to
      become of the estate if it fell into the hands of a spendthrift? No man
      should make ducks and drakes of Hazeldean; let Frank beware of that," etc.
      Secondly, the squire was not only fond of his lands, but he was jealous of
      them,&mdash;that jealousy which even the tenderest fathers sometimes
      entertain towards their natural heirs. He could not bear the notion that
      Frank should count on his death; and he seldom closed an admonitory letter
      without repeating the information that Hazeldean was not entailed; that it
      was his to do with as he pleased through life and in death. Indirect
      menace of this nature rather wounded and galled than intimidated Frank;
      for the young man was extremely generous and high-spirited by nature, and
      was always more disposed to some indiscretion after such warnings to his
      self-interest, as if to show that those were the last kinds of appeal
      likely to influence him. By the help of such insights into the character
      of father and son, Randal thought he saw gleams of daylight illumining his
      own chance to the lands of Hazeldean. Meanwhile, it appeared to him
      obvious that, come what might of it, his own interests could not lose, and
      might most probably gain, by whatever could alienate the squire from his
      natural heir. Accordingly, though with consummate tact, he instigated
      Frank towards the very excesses most calculated to irritate the squire,
      all the while appearing rather to give the counter advice, and never
      sharing in any of the follies to which he conducted his thoughtless
      friend. In this he worked chiefly through others, introducing Frank to
      every acquaintance most dangerous to youth, either from the wit that
      laughs at prudence, or the spurious magnificence that subsists so
      handsomely upon bills endorsed by friends of "great expectations."
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister and his protege were seated at breakfast, the first reading
      the newspaper, the last glancing over his letters; for Randal had arrived
      to the dignity of receiving many letters,&mdash;ay, and notes, too,
      three-cornered and fantastically embossed. Egerton uttered an exclamation,
      and laid down the newspaper. Randal looked up from his correspondence. The
      minister had sunk into one of his absent reveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long silence, observing that Egerton did not return to the
      newspaper, Randal said, "Ahem, sir, I have a note from Frank Hazeldean,
      who wants much to see me; his father has arrived in town unexpectedly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What brings him here?" asked Egerton, still abstractedly. "Why, it seems
      that he has heard some vague reports of poor Frank's extravagance, and
      Frank is rather afraid or ashamed to meet him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, a very great fault, extravagance in the young!&mdash;destroys
      independence; ruins or enslaves the future. Great fault,&mdash;very! And
      what does youth want that it should be extravagant? Has it not everything
      in itself, merely because it is? Youth is youth&mdash;what needs it more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton rose as he said this, and retired to his writing-table, and in his
      turn opened his correspondence. Randal took up the newspaper, and
      endeavoured, but in vain, to conjecture what had excited the minister's
      exclamations and the revery that succeeded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton suddenly and sharply turned round in his chair&mdash;"If you have
      done with the 'Times,' have the goodness to place it here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal had just obeyed, when a knock at the street-door was heard, and
      presently Lord L'Estrange came into the room, with somewhat a quicker step
      and somewhat a gayer mien than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley's hand, as if mechanically, fell upon the newspaper,&mdash;fell
      upon that part of the columns devoted to births, deaths, and marriages.
      Randal stood by, and noted; then, bowing to L'Estrange, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Audley," said L'Estrange, "I have had an adventure since I saw you,&mdash;an
      adventure that reopened the Past, and may influence my future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, I have met with a relation of&mdash;of&mdash;the
      Avenels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Whom,&mdash;Richard Avenel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard&mdash;Richard&mdash;who is he? Oh, I remember, the wild lad who
      went off to America; but that was when I was a mere child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Richard Avenel is now a rich, thriving trader, and his marriage is
      in this newspaper,&mdash;married to an Honourable Mrs. M'Catchley. Well,
      in this country who should plume himself on birth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did not say so always, Egerton," replied Harley, with a tone of
      mournful reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I say so now pertinently to a Mrs. M'Catchley, not to the heir of the
      L'Estranges. But no more of these&mdash;these Avenels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, more of them. I tell you I have met a relation of theirs&mdash;a
      nephew of&mdash;of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of Richard Avenel's?" interrupted Egerton; and then added in the slow,
      deliberate, argumentative tone in which he was wont to speak in public,
      "Richard Avenel the trader! I saw him once,&mdash;a presuming and
      intolerable man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The nephew has not those sins. He is full of promise, of modesty, yet of
      pride. And his countenance&mdash;oh, Egerton, he has her eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton made no answer, and Harley resumed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had thought of placing him under your care. I knew you would provide
      for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will. Bring him hither," cried Egerton, eagerly. "All that I can do to
      prove my&mdash;regard for a wish of yours." Harley pressed his friend's
      hand warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you from my heart; the Audley of my boyhood speaks now. But the
      young man has decided otherwise; and I do not blame him. Nay, I rejoice
      that he chooses a career in which, if he find hardship, he may escape
      dependence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that career is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Letters! Literature!" exclaimed the statesman. "Beggary! No, no, Harley,
      this is your absurd romance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will not be beggary, and it is not my romance: it is the boy's. Leave
      him alone, he is my care and my charge henceforth. He is of her blood, and
      I said that he had HER eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are going abroad; let me know where he is; I will watch over
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And unsettle a right ambition for a wrong one? No, you shall know nothing
      of him till he can proclaim himself. I think that day will come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley mused a moment, and then said, "Well, perhaps you are right. After
      all, as you say, independence is a great blessing, and my ambition has not
      rendered myself the better or the happier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, my poor Audley, you ask me to be ambitious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only wish you to be consoled," cried Egerton, with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try to be so; and by the help of a milder remedy than yours. I
      said that my adventure might influence my future; it brought me acquainted
      not only with the young man I speak of, but the most winning, affectionate
      child,&mdash;a girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this child an Avenel too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she is of gentle blood,&mdash;a soldier's daughter; the daughter of
      that Captain Digby on whose behalf I was a petitioner to your patronage.
      He is dead, and in dying, my name was on his lips. He meant me, doubtless,
      to be the guardian to his orphan. I shall be so. I have at last an object
      in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you seriously mean to take this child with you abroad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seriously, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And lodge her in your own house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a year or so, while she is yet a child. Then, as she approaches
      youth, I shall place her elsewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may grow to love her. Is it clear that she will love you,&mdash;not
      mistake gratitude for love? It is a very hazardous experiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So was William the Norman's,&mdash;still he was William the Conqueror.
      Thou biddest me move on from the Past, and be consoled, yet thou wouldst
      make me as inapt to progress as the mule in Slawkenbergius's tale, with
      thy cursed interlocutions, 'Stumbling, by Saint Nicholas, every step. Why,
      at this rate, we shall be all night in getting into'&mdash;HAPPINESS!
      Listen," continued Harley, setting off, full pelt, into one of his wild
      whimsical humours. "One of the sons of the prophets in Israel felling wood
      near the river Jordan, his hatchet forsook the helve, and fell to the
      bottom of the river; so he prayed to have it again (it was but a small
      request, mark you); and having a strong faith, he did not throw the
      hatchet after the helve, but the helve after the hatchet. Presently two
      great miracles were seen. Up springs the hatchet from the bottom of the
      water, and fixes itself to its old acquaintance, the helve. Now, had he
      wished to coach it up to heaven in a fiery chariot like Elias, be as rich
      as Job, strong as Samson, and beautiful as Absalom, would he have obtained
      the wish, do you think? In truth, my friend, I question it very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't comprehend what you mean. Sad stuff you are talking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot help that; 'Rabelais is to be blamed for it. I am quoting him,
      and it is to be found in his Prologue to the Chapters on the 'Moderation
      of Wishes.' And a propos of 'moderate wishes in point of hatchet,' I want
      you to understand that I ask but little from Heaven. I fling but the helve
      after the hatchet that has sunk into the silent stream. I want the other
      half of the weapon that is buried fathom deep, and for want of which the
      thick woods darken round me by the Sacred River, and I can catch not a
      glimpse of the stars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In plain English," said Audley Egerton, "you want&mdash;" he stopped
      short, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want my purpose and my will, and my old character, and the nature God
      gave me. I want the half of my soul which has fallen from me. I want such
      love as may replace to me the vanished affections. Reason not,&mdash;I
      throw the helve after the hatchet."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie, on leaving Audley, repaired to Frank's lodgings, and after
      being closeted with the young Guardsman an hour or so, took his way to
      Limmer's hotel, and asked for Mr. Hazeldean. He was shown into the
      coffee-room, while the waiter went up-stairs with his card, to see if the
      squire was within, and disengaged. The "Times" newspaper lay sprawling on
      one of the tables, and Randal, leaning over it, looked with attention into
      the column containing births, deaths, and marriages. But in that long and
      miscellaneous list he could not conjecture the name which had so excited
      Mr. Egerton's interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vexatious!" he muttered; "there is no knowledge which has power more
      useful than that of the secrets of men."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned as the waiter entered and said that Mr. Hazeldean would be glad
      to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Randal entered the drawing-room, the squire, shaking hands with him,
      looked towards the door as if expecting some one else; and his honest face
      assumed a blank expression of disappointment, when the door closed, and he
      found that Randal was unaccompanied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, bluntly, "I thought your old schoolfellow, Frank, might
      have been with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you not seen him yet, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I came to town this morning; travelled outside the mail; sent to his
      barracks, but the young gentleman does not sleep there, has an apartment
      of his own; he never told me that. We are a plain family, the Hazeldeans,
      young sir; and I hate being kept in the dark,&mdash;by my own son, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal made no answer, but looked sorrowful. The squire, who had never
      before seen his kinsman, had a vague idea that it was not polite to
      entertain a stranger, though a connection to himself, with his family
      troubles, and so resumed good-naturedly, "I am very glad to make your
      acquaintance at last, Mr. Leslie. You know, I hope, that you have good
      Hazeldean blood in your veins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (smiling).&mdash;"I am not likely to forget that; it is the boast
      of our pedigree."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (heartily).&mdash;"Shake hands again on it, my boy. You don't want
      a friend, since my grandee of a half-brother has taken you up; but if ever
      you should, Hazeldean is not very far from Rood. Can't get on with your
      father at all, my lad,&mdash;more 's the pity, for I think I could have
      given him a hint or two as to the improvement of his property. If he would
      plant those ugly commons&mdash;larch and fir soon come into profit, sir;
      and there are some low lands about Rood that would take mighty kindly to
      draining."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"My poor father lives a life so retired&mdash;and you cannot
      wonder at it. Fallen trees lie still, and so do fallen families."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Fallen families can get up again, which fallen trees
      can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Ah, sir, it often takes the energy of generations to repair
      the thriftlessness and extravagance of a single owner."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (his brow lowering).&mdash;"That's very true. Frank is d&mdash;-d
      extravagant; treats me very coolly, too&mdash;not coming; near three
      o'clock. By the by, I suppose he told you where I was, otherwise how did
      you find me out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (reluctantly).&mdash;"Sir, he did; and to speak frankly, I am not
      surprised that he has not yet appeared."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Eh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"We have grown very intimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"So he writes me word,&mdash;and I am glad of it. Our
      member, Sir John, tells me you are a very clever fellow, and a very steady
      one. And Frank says that he wishes he had your prudence, if he can't have
      your talent. He has a good heart, Frank," added the father, relentingly.
      "But zounds, sir, you say you are not surprised he has not come to welcome
      his own father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir," said Randal, "you wrote word to Frank that you had heard
      from Sir John and others of his goings-on, and that you were not satisfied
      with his replies to your letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then you suddenly come up to town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well. And Frank is ashamed to meet you. For, as you say, he has been
      extravagant, and he has exceeded his allowance; and knowing my respect for
      you and my great affection for himself, he has asked me to prepare you to
      receive his confession and forgive him. I know I am taking a great
      liberty. I have no right to interfere between father and son; but pray&mdash;pray
      think I mean for the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said the squire, recovering himself very slowly, and showing
      evident pain, "I knew already that Frank had spent more than he ought; but
      I think he should not have employed a third person to prepare me to
      forgive him. (Excuse me,&mdash;no offence.) And if he wanted a third
      person, was not there his own mother? What the devil! [firing up] am I a
      tyrant, a bashaw, that my own son is afraid to speak to me? 'Gad, I'll
      give it him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, sir," said Randal, assuming at once that air of authority
      which superior intellect so well carries off and excuses, "but I strongly
      advise you not to express any anger at Frank's confidence in me. At
      present I have influence over him. Whatever you may think of his
      extravagance, I have saved him from many an indiscretion, and many a debt,&mdash;a
      young man will listen to one of his own age so much more readily than even
      to the kindest friend of graver years. Indeed, sir, I speak for your sake
      as well as for Frank's. Let me keep this influence over him; and don't
      reproach him for the confidence placed in me. Nay, let him rather think
      that I have softened any displeasure you might otherwise have felt."
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed so much good sense in what Randal said, and the kindness of
      it seemed so disinterested, that the squire's native shrewdness was
      deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a fine young fellow," said he, "and I am very much obliged to
      you. Well, I suppose there is no putting old heads upon young shoulders;
      and I promise you I'll not say an angry word to Frank. I dare say, poor
      boy, he is very much afflicted, and I long to shake hands with him. So,
      set his mind at ease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir," said Randal, with much apparent emotion, "your son may well
      love you: and it seems to be a hard matter for so kind a heart as yours to
      preserve the proper firmness with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I can be firm enough," quoth the squire,&mdash;"especially when I
      don't see him,&mdash;handsome dog that he is: very like his mother&mdash;don't
      you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw his mother, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Gad! Not seen my Harry? No more you have; you must come and pay us a
      visit. I suppose my half-brother will let you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, sir. Will you not call on him while you are in town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I. He would think I expected to get something from the Government.
      Tell him the ministers must go on a little better, if they want my vote
      for their member. But go, I see you are impatient to tell Frank that all
      's forgot and forgiven. Come and dine with him here at six, and let him
      bring his bills in his pocket. Oh, I sha'n't scold him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, as to that," said Randal, smiling, "I think (forgive me still) that
      you should not take it too easily; just as I think that you had better not
      blame him for his very natural and praiseworthy shame in approaching you,
      so I think, also, that you should do nothing that would tend to diminish
      that shame,&mdash;it is such a check on him. And therefore, if you can
      contrive to affect to be angry with him for his extravagance, it will do
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak like a book, and I'll try my best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you threaten, for instance, to take him out of the army, and settle
      him in the country, it would have a very good effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! would he think it so great a punishment to come home and live with
      his parents?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't say that; but he is naturally so fond of London. At his age, and
      with his large inheritance, that is natural."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inheritance!" said the squire, moodily,&mdash;"inheritance! he is not
      thinking of that, I trust? Zounds, sir, I have as good a life as his own.
      Inheritance!&mdash;to be sure the Casino property is entailed on him; but
      as for the rest, sir, I am no tenant for life. I could leave the Hazeldean
      lands to my ploughman, if I chose it. Inheritance; indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, I did not mean to imply that Frank would entertain the
      unnatural and monstrous idea of calculating on your death; and all we have
      to do is to get him to sow his wild oats as soon as possible,&mdash;marry
      and settle down into the country. For it would be a thousand pities if his
      town habits and tastes grew permanent,&mdash;a bad thing for the Hazeldean
      property, that! And," added Randal, laughing, "I feel an interest in the
      old place, since my grandmother comes of the stock. So, just force
      yourself to seem angry, and grumble a little when you pay the bills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah, trust me," said the squire, doggedly, and with a very altered
      air. "I am much obliged to you for these hints, my young kinsman." And his
      stout hand trembled a little as he extended it to Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Limmer's, Randal hastened to Frank's rooms in St. James's Street.
      "My dear fellow," said he, when he entered, "it is very fortunate that I
      persuaded you to let me break matters to your father. You might well say
      he was rather passionate; but I have contrived to soothe him. You need not
      fear that he will not pay your debts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never feared that," said Frank, changing colour; "I only feared his
      anger. But, indeed, I fear his kindness still more. What a reckless hound
      I have been! However, it shall be a lesson to me. And my debts once paid,
      I will turn as economical as yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, Frank. And, indeed, I am a little afraid that, when your
      father knows the total, he may execute a threat that would be very
      unpleasant to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make you sell out, and give up London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil!" exclaimed Frank, with fervent emphasis; "that would be
      treating me like a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it would make you seem rather ridiculous to your set, which is not a
      very rural one. And you, who like London so much, and are so much the
      fashion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk of it," cried Frank, walking to and fro the room in great
      disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, on the whole, it might be well not to say all you owe, at once.
      If you named half the sum, your father would let you off with a lecture;
      and really I tremble at the effect of the total."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how shall I pay the other half?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you must save from your allowance; it is a very liberal one; and the
      tradesmen are not pressing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but the cursed bill-brokers&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always renew to a young man of your expectations. And if I get into an
      office, I can always help you, my dear Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Randal, I am not so bad as to take advantage of your friendship,"
      said Frank, warmly. "But it seems to me mean after all, and a sort of a
      lie, indeed, disguising the real state of my affairs. I should not have
      listened to the idea from any one else; but you are such a sensible, kind,
      honourable fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After epithets so flattering, I shrink from the responsibility of advice.
      But apart from your own interests, I should be glad to save your father
      the pain he would feel at knowing the whole extent of the scrape you have
      got into. And if it entailed on you the necessity to lay by&mdash;and give
      up hazard, and not be security for other men&mdash;why, it would be the
      best thing that could happen. Really, too, it seems hard upon Mr.
      Hazeldean that he should be the only sufferer, and quite just that you
      should bear half your own burdens."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is, Randal; that did not strike me before. I will take your
      counsel; and now I will go at once to Limmer's. My dear father! I hope he
      is looking well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very. Such a contrast to the sallow Londoners! But I think you had
      better not go till dinner. He has asked me to meet you at six. I will call
      for you a little before, and we can go together. This will prevent a good
      deal of gene and constraint. Good-by till then. Ha! by the way, I think if
      I were you, I would not take the matter too seriously and penitentially.
      You see the best of fathers like to keep their sons under their thumb, as
      the saying is. And if you want at your age to preserve your independence,
      and not be hurried off and buried in the country, like a schoolboy in
      disgrace, a little manliness of bearing would not be amiss. You can think
      over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner at Limmer's went off very differently from what it ought to
      have done. Randal's words had sunk deep, and rankled sorely in the
      squire's mind; and that impression imparted a certain coldness to his
      manner which belied the hearty, forgiving, generous impulse with which he
      had come up to London, and which even Randal had not yet altogether
      whispered away. On the other hand, Frank, embarrassed both by the sense of
      disingenuousness, and a desire "not to take the thing too seriously,"
      seemed to the squire ungracious and thankless.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner the squire began to hum and haw, and Frank to colour up and
      shrink. Both felt discomposed by the presence of a third person; till,
      with an art and address worthy of a better cause, Randal himself broke the
      ice, and so contrived to remove the restraint he had before imposed, that
      at length each was heartily glad to have matters made clear and brief by
      his dexterity and tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank's debts were not in reality large; and when he named the half of
      them, looking down in shame, the squire, agreeably surprised, was about to
      express himself with a liberal heartiness that would have opened his son's
      excellent heart at once to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a warning look from Randal checked the impulse; and the squire thought
      it right, as he had promised, to affect an anger he did not feel, and let
      fall the unlucky threat, "that it was all very well once in a way to
      exceed his allowance; but if Frank did not, in future, show more sense
      than to be led away by a set of London sharks and coxcombs, he must cut
      the army, come home, and take to farming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank imprudently exclaimed, "Oh, sir, I have no taste for farming. And
      after London, at my age, the country would be so horribly dull."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha!" said the squire, very grimly&mdash;and he thrust back into his
      pocket-book some extra bank-notes which his fingers had itched to add to
      those he had already counted out. "The country is terribly dull, is it?
      Money goes there not upon follies and vices, but upon employing honest
      labourers, and increasing the wealth of the nation. It does not please you
      to spend money in that way: it is a pity you should ever be plagued with
      such duties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear father&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your tongue, you puppy. Oh, I dare say, if you were in my shoes, you
      would cut down the oaks, and mortgage the property; sell it, for what I
      know,&mdash;all go on a cast of the dice! Aha, sir&mdash;very well, very
      well&mdash;the country is horribly dull, is it? Pray stay in town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Hazeldean," said Randal, blandly, and as if with the wish to
      turn off into a joke what threatened to be serious, "you must not
      interpret a hasty expression so literally. Why, you would make Frank as
      bad as Lord A&mdash;&mdash;-, who wrote word to his steward to cut down
      more timber; and when the steward replied, 'There are only three
      sign-posts left on the whole estate,' wrote back, 'They've done growing at
      all events,&mdash;down with them!' You ought to know Lord A&mdash;&mdash;-,
      sir; so witty; and&mdash;Frank's particular friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your particular friend, Master Frank? Pretty friends!" and the squire
      buttoned up the pocket to which he had transferred his note-book, with a
      determined air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm his friend, too," said Randal, kindly; "and I preach to him
      properly, I can tell you." Then, as if delicately anxious to change the
      subject, he began to ask questions upon crops and the experiment of bone manure.
      He spoke earnestly, and with gusto, yet with the deference of one
      listening to a great practical authority. Randal had spent the afternoon
      in cramming the subject from agricultural journals and parliamentary
      reports; and like all practised readers, had really learned in a few hours
      more than many a man, unaccustomed to study, could gain from books in a
      year. The squire was surprised and pleased at the young scholar's
      information and taste for such subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, to be sure," quoth he, with an angry look at poor Frank, "you have
      good Hazeldean blood in you, and know a bean from a turnip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, sir," said Randal, ingenuously, "I am training myself for public
      life; and what is a public man worth if he do not study the agriculture of
      his country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right&mdash;what is he worth? Put that question, with my compliments, to
      my half-brother. What stuff he did talk, the other night, on the malt-tax,
      to be sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Egerton has had so many other things to think of, that we must excuse
      his want of information upon one topic, however important. With his strong
      sense he must acquire that information, sooner or later; for he is fond of
      power; and, sir, knowledge is power!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true,&mdash;very fine saying," quoth the poor squire,
      unsuspiciously, as Randal's eye rested on Mr. Hazeldean's open face, and
      then glanced towards Frank, who looked sad and bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," repeated Randal, "knowledge is power;" and he shook his head
      wisely, as he passed the bottle to his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, when the squire, who meant to return to the Hall next morning, took
      leave of Frank, his heart warmed to his son; and still more for Frank's
      dejected looks. It was not Randal's policy to push estrangement too far at
      first, and in his own presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak to poor Frank,&mdash;kindly now, sir&mdash;do;" whispered be,
      observing the squire's watery eyes, as he moved to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, rejoiced to obey, thrust out his hand to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," said he, "there, don't fret&mdash;pshaw!&mdash;it was but a
      trifle after all. Think no more of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank took the hand, and suddenly threw his arm round his father's broad
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, you are too good,&mdash;too good." His voice trembled so that
      Randal took alarm, passed by him, and touched him meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire pressed his son to his heart,&mdash;heart so large, that it
      seemed to fill the whole width under his broadcloth. "My dear Frank," said
      he, half blubbering, "it is not the money; but, you see, it so vexes your
      poor mother; you must be careful in future; and, zounds, boy, it will be
      all yours one day; only don't calculate on it; I could not bear that, I
      could not, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Calculate!" cried Frank. "Oh, sir, can you think it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so delighted that I had some slight hand in your complete
      reconciliation with Mr. Hazeldean," said Randal, as the young men walked
      from the hotel. "I saw that you were disheartened, and I told him to speak
      to you kindly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you? Ah&mdash;I am sorry he needed telling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know his character so well already," said Randal, "that I flatter
      myself I can always keep things between you as they ought to be. What an
      excellent man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The best man in the world," cried Frank, heartily; and then, as his
      accents drooped, "yet I have deceived him. I have a great mind to go back&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And tell him to give you twice as much money as you had asked for? He
      would think you had only seemed so affectionate in order to take him in.
      No, no, Frank! save, lay by, economize; and then tell him that you have
      paid half your own debts. Something high-minded in that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there is. Your heart is as good as your head. Goodnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going home so early? Have you no engagements!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None that I shall keep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted, and Randal walked into one of the fashionable clubs. He
      neared a table where three or four young men (younger sons, who lived in
      the most splendid style, Heaven knew how) were still over their wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie had little in common with these gentlemen, but he forced his nature
      to be agreeable to them, in consequence of a very excellent piece of
      worldly advice given to him by Audley Egerton. "Never let the dandies call
      you a prig," said the statesman. "Many a clever fellow fails through life,
      because the silly fellows, whom half a word well spoken could make his
      claqueurs, turn him into ridicule. Whatever you are, avoid the fault of
      most reading men: in a word, don't be a prig!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just left Hazeldean," said Randal. "What a good fellow he is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital!" said the Honourable George Borrowell. "Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he is gone to his rooms. He has had a little scene with his father,
      a thorough, rough country squire. It would be an act of charity if you
      would go and keep him company, or take him with you to some place a little
      more lively than his own lodgings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! the old gentleman has been teasing him!&mdash;a horrid shame! Why,
      Frank is not extravagant, and he will be very rich, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An immense property," said Randal, "and not a mortgage on it: an only
      son," he added, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these young gentlemen there was a kindly and most benevolent
      whisper, and presently they all rose, and walked away towards Frank's
      lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wedge is in the tree," said Randal to himself, "and there is a gap
      already between the bark and the wood."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harley L'Estrange is seated beside Helen at the lattice-window in the
      cottage at Norwood. The bloom of reviving health is on the child's face,
      and she is listening with a smile, for Harley is speaking of Leonard with
      praise, and of Leonard's future with hope. "And thus," he continued,
      "secure from his former trials, happy in his occupation, and pursuing the
      career he has chosen, we must be content, my dear child, to leave him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave him!" exclaimed Helen, and the rose on her cheek faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was not displeased to see her emotion. He would have been
      disappointed in her heart if it had been less susceptible to affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is hard on you, Helen," said he, "to be separated from one who has
      been to you as a brother. Do not hate me for doing so. But I consider
      myself your guardian, and your home as yet must be mine. We are going from
      this land of cloud and mist, going as into the world of summer. Well, that
      does not content you. You weep, my child; you mourn your own friend, but
      do not forget your father's. I am alone, and often sad, Helen; will you
      not comfort me? You press my hand, but you must learn to smile on me also.
      You are born to be the comforter. Comforters are not egotists; they are
      always cheerful when they console."
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Harley was so sweet and his words went so home to the child's
      heart, that she looked up and smiled in his face as he kissed her
      ingenuous brow. But then she thought of Leonard, and felt so solitary, so
      bereft, that tears burst forth again. Before these were dried, Leonard
      himself entered, and, obeying an irresistible impulse, she sprang to his
      arms, and leaning her head on his shoulder, sobbed out,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going from you, brother; do not grieve, do not miss me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was much moved: he folded his arms, and contemplated them both
      silently,&mdash;and his own eyes were moist. "This heart," thought he,
      "will be worth the winning!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew aside Leonard, and whispered, "Soothe, but encourage and support
      her. I leave you together; come to me in the garden later."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly an hour before Leonard joined Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was not weeping when you left her?" asked L'Estrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; she has more fortitude than we might suppose. Heaven knows how that
      fortitude has supported mine. I have promised to write to her often."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley took two strides across the lawn, and then, coming back to Leonard,
      said, "Keep your promise, and write often for the first year. I would then
      ask you to let the correspondence drop gradually."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drop! Ah, my Lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look you, my young friend, I wish to lead this fair mind wholly from the
      sorrows of the past. I wish Helen to enter, not abruptly, but step by
      step, into a new life. You love each other now, as do two children,&mdash;as
      brother and sister. But later, if encouraged, would the love be the same?
      And is it not better for both of you that youth should open upon the world
      with youth's natural affections free and unforestalled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True! And she is so above me," said Leonard, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one is above him who succeeds in your ambition, Leonard. It is not
      that, believe me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Harley, with a smile, "I rather feel that you are above
      me. For what vantage-ground is so high as youth? Perhaps I may become
      jealous of you. It is well that she should learn to like one who is to be
      henceforth her guardian and protector. Yet how can she like me as she
      ought, if her heart is to be full of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy bowed his head; and Harley hastened to change the subject, and
      speak of letters and of glory. His words were eloquent and his voice
      kindling; for he had been an enthusiast for fame in his boyhood, and in
      Leonard's his own seemed to him to revive. But the poet's heart gave back
      no echo,&mdash;suddenly it seemed void and desolate. Yet when Leonard
      walked back by the moonlight, he muttered to himself, "Strange, strange,
      so mere a child! this cannot be love! Still, what else to love is there
      left to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he paused upon the bridge where he had so often stood with Helen,
      and on which he had found the protector that had given to her a home, to
      himself a career. And life seemed very long, and fame but a dreary
      phantom. Courage still, Leonard! These are the sorrows of the heart that
      teach thee more than all the precepts of sage and critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day, and Helen had left the shores of England, with her fanciful
      and dreaming guardian. Years will pass before our tale re-opens. Life in
      all the forms we have seen it travels on. And the squire farms and hunts;
      and the parson preaches and chides and soothes; and Riccabocca reads his
      Machiavelli, and sighs and smiles as he moralizes on Men and States; and
      Violante's dark eyes grow deeper and more spiritual in their lustre, and
      her beauty takes thought from solitary dreams. And Mr. Richard Avenel has
      his house in London, and the Honourable Mrs. Avenel her opera-box; and
      hard and dire is their struggle into fashion, and hotly does the new man,
      scorning the aristocracy, pant to become aristocrat. And Audley Egerton
      goes from the office to the parliament, and drudges, and debates, and
      helps to govern the empire in which the sun never sets. Poor sun, how
      tired he must be&mdash;but not more tired than the Government! And Randal
      Leslie has an excellent place in the bureau of a minister, and is looking
      to the time when he shall resign it to come into parliament, and on that
      large arena turn knowledge into power. And meanwhile he is much where he
      was with Audley Egerton; but he has established intimacy with the squire,
      and visited Hazeldean twice, and examined the house and the map of the
      property, and very nearly fallen a second time into the ha-ha, and the
      squire believes that Randal Leslie alone can keep Frank out of mischief,
      and has spoken rough words to his Harry about Frank's continued
      extravagance. And Frank does continue to pursue pleasure, and is very
      miserable, and horribly in debt. And Madame di Negra has gone from London
      to Paris, and taken a tour into Switzerland, and come back to London
      again, and has grown very intimate with Randal Leslie; and Randal has
      introduced Frank to her; and Frank thinks her the loveliest woman in the
      world, and grossly slandered by certain evil tongues. And the brother of
      Madame di Negra is expected in England at last; and what with his repute
      for beauty and for wealth, people anticipate a sensation. And Leonard, and
      Harley, and Helen? Patience,&mdash;they will all re-appear.

    <h2>
      INITIAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ABUSE OF INTELLECT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is at present so vehement a flourish of trumpets, and so prodigious
      a roll of the drum, whenever we are called upon to throw up our hats, and
      cry "Huzza" to the "March of Enlightenment," that, out of that very spirit
      of contradiction natural to all rational animals, one is tempted to stop
      one's ears, and say, "Gently, gently; LIGHT is noiseless: how comes
      'Enlightenment' to make such a clatter? Meanwhile, if it be not
      impertinent, pray, where is Enlightenment marching to?" Ask that question
      of any six of the loudest bawlers in the procession, and I'll wager
      tenpence to California that you get six very unsatisfactory answers. One
      respectable gentleman, who, to our great astonishment, insists upon
      calling himself "a slave," but has a remarkably free way of expressing his
      opinions, will reply, "Enlightenment is marching towards the seven points
      of the Charter." Another, with his hair a la jeune France, who has taken a
      fancy to his friend's wife, and is rather embarrassed with his own,
      asserts that Enlightenment is proceeding towards the Rights of Women, the
      reign of Social Love, and the annihilation of Tyrannical Prejudice. A
      third, who has the air of a man well-to-do in the middle class, more
      modest in his hopes, because he neither wishes to have his head broken by
      his errand-boy, nor his wife carried off to an Agapemone by his
      apprentice, does not take Enlightenment a step farther than a siege on
      Debrett, and a cannonade on the Budget. Illiberal man! the march that he
      swells will soon trample him under foot. No one fares so ill in a crowd as
      the man who is wedged in the middle. A fourth, looking wild and dreamy, as
      if he had come out of the cave of Trophonius, and who is a mesmerizer and
      a mystic, thinks Enlightenment is in full career towards the good old days
      of alchemists and necromancers. A fifth, whom one might take for a Quaker,
      asserts that the march of Enlightenment is a crusade for universal
      philanthropy, vegetable diet, and the perpetuation of peace by means of
      speeches, which certainly do produce a very contrary effect from the
      Philippics of Demosthenes! The sixth&mdash;good fellow without a rag on
      his back&mdash;does not care a straw where the march goes. He can't be
      worse off than he is; and it is quite immaterial to him whether he goes to
      the dog-star above, or the bottomless pit below. I say nothing, however,
      against the march, while we take it altogether. Whatever happens, one is
      in good company; and though I am somewhat indolent by nature, and would
      rather stay at home with Locke and Burke (dull dogs though they were) than
      have my thoughts set off helter-skelter with those cursed trumpets and
      drums, blown and dub-a-dubbed by fellows whom I vow to heaven I would not
      trust with a five-pound note,&mdash;still, if I must march, I must; and so
      deuce take the hindmost! But when it comes to individual marchers upon
      their own account,&mdash;privateers and condottieri of Enlightenment,&mdash;who
      have filled their pockets with Lucifer matches, and have a sublime
      contempt for their neighbour's barns and hay-ricks, I don't see why I
      should throw myself into the seventh heaven of admiration and ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If those who are eternally rhapsodizing on the celestial blessings that
      are to follow Enlightenment, Universal Knowledge, and so forth, would just
      take their eyes out of their pockets, and look about them, I would
      respectfully inquire if they have never met any very knowing and
      enlightened gentleman, whose acquaintance is by no means desirable. If
      not, they are monstrous lucky. Every man must judge by his own experience;
      and the worst rogues I have ever encountered were amazingly well-informed
      clever fellows. From dunderheads and dunces we can protect ourselves, but
      from your sharpwitted gentleman, all enlightenment and no prejudice, we
      have but to cry, "Heaven defend us!" It is true, that the rogue (let him
      be ever so enlightened) usually comes to no good himself,&mdash;though not
      before he has done harm enough to his neighbours. But that only shows that
      the world wants something else in those it rewards besides intelligence
      per se and in the abstract; and is much too old a world to allow any Jack
      Horner to pick out its plums for his own personal gratification. Hence a
      man of very moderate intelligence, who believes in God, suffers his heart
      to beat with human sympathies, and keeps his eyes off your strongbox, will
      perhaps gain a vast deal more power than knowledge ever gives to a rogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherefore, though I anticipate an outcry against me on the part of the
      blockheads, who, strange to say, are the most credulous idolators of
      Enlightenment, and if knowledge were power, would rot on a dunghill, yet,
      nevertheless, I think all really enlightened men will agree with me, that
      when one falls in with detached sharpshooters from the general March of
      Enlightenment, it is no reason that we should make ourselves a target,
      because Enlightenment has furnished them with a gun. It has, doubtless,
      been already remarked by the judicious reader that of the numerous
      characters introduced into this work, the larger portion belong to that
      species which we call the INTELLECTUAL,&mdash;that through them are
      analyzed and developed human intellect, in various forms and directions.
      So that this History, rightly considered, is a kind of humble familiar
      Epic, or, if you prefer it, a long Serio-Comedy, upon the Varieties of
      English Life in this our Century, set in movement by the intelligences
      most prevalent. And where more ordinary and less refined types of the
      species round and complete the survey of our passing generation, they will
      often suggest, by contrast, the deficiencies which mere intellectual
      culture leaves in the human being. Certainly, I have no spite against
      intellect and enlightenment. Heaven forbid I should be such a Goth! I am
      only the advocate for common-sense and fair play. I don't think an able
      man necessarily an angel; but I think if his heart match his head, and
      both proceed in the Great March under the divine Oriflamine, he goes as
      near to the angel as humanity will permit: if not, if he has but a
      penn'orth of heart to a pound of brains, I say, "Bon jour, mon ange! I see
      not the starry upward wings, but the grovelling cloven-hoof." I 'd rather
      be obfuscated by the Squire of Hazeldean than en lightened by Randal
      Leslie. Every man to his taste. But intellect itself (not in the
      philosophical but the ordinary sense of the term) is rarely, if ever, one
      completed harmonious agency; it is not one faculty, but a compound of
      many, some of which are often at war with each other, and mar the concord
      of the whole. Few of us but have some predominant faculty, in itself a
      strength; but which, usurping unseasonably dominion over the rest, shares
      the lot of all tyranny, however brilliant, and leaves the empire weak
      against disaffection within, and invasion from without. Hence, intellect
      may be perverted in a man of evil disposition, and sometimes merely wasted
      in a man of excellent impulses, for want of the necessary discipline, or
      of a strong ruling motive. I doubt if there be one person in the world who
      has obtained a high reputation for talent, who has not met somebody much
      cleverer than himself, which said somebody has never obtained any
      reputation at all! Men like Audley Egerton are constantly seen in the
      great positions of life; while men like Harley L'Estrange, who could have
      beaten them hollow in anything equally striven for by both, float away
      down the stream, and, unless some sudden stimulant arouse their dreamy
      energies, vanish out of sight into silent graves. If Hamlet and Polonius
      were living now, Polonius would have a much better chance of being a
      Cabinet Minister, though Hamlet would unquestionably be a much more
      intellectual character. What would become of Hamlet? Heaven knows! Dr.
      Arnold said, from his experience of a school, that the difference between
      one man and another was not mere ability,&mdash;it was energy. There is a
      great deal of truth in that saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submitting these hints to the judgment and penetration of the sagacious, I
      enter on the fresh division of this work, and see already Randal Leslie
      gnawing his lips on the background. The German poet observes that the Cow
      of Isis is to some the divine symbol of knowledge, to others but the milch
      cow, only regarded for the pounds of butter she will yield. O tendency of
      our age, to look on Isis as the milch cow! O prostitution of the grandest
      desires to the basest uses! Gaze on the goddess, Randal Leslie, and get
      ready thy churn and thy scales. Let us see what the butter will fetch in
      the market.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A new Reign has commenced. There has been a general election; the
      unpopularity of the Administration has been apparent at the hustings.
      Audley Egerton, hitherto returned by vast majorities, has barely escaped
      defeat&mdash;thanks to a majority of five. The expenses of his election
      are said to have been prodigious. "But who can stand against such wealth
      as Egerton's,&mdash;no doubt backed, too, by the Treasury purse?" said the
      defeated candidate. It is towards the close of October; London is already
      full; parliament will meet in less than a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the principal apartments of that hotel in which foreigners may
      discover what is meant by English comfort, and the price which foreigners
      must pay for it, there sat two persons side by side, engaged in close
      conversation. The one was a female, in whose pale clear complexion and
      raven hair, in whose eyes, vivid with a power of expression rarely
      bestowed on the beauties of the North, we recognize Beatrice, Marchesa di
      Negra. Undeniably handsome as was the Italian lady, her companion, though
      a man, and far advanced into middle age, was yet more remarkable for
      personal advantages. There was a strong family likeness between the two;
      but there was also a striking contrast in air, manner, and all that stamps
      on the physiognomy the idiosyncrasies of character. There was something of
      gravity, of earnestness and passion, in Beatrice's countenance when
      carefully examined; her smile at times might be false, but it was rarely
      ironical, never cynical. Her gestures, though graceful, were unrestrained
      and frequent. You could see she was a daughter of the South. Her
      companion, on the contrary, preserved on the fair, smooth face, to which
      years had given scarcely a line or wrinkle, something that might have
      passed, at first glance, for the levity and thoughtlessness of a gay and
      youthful nature; but the smile, though exquisitely polished, took at times
      the derision of a sneer. In his manners he was as composed and as free
      from gesture as an Englishman. His hair was of that red brown with which
      the Italian painters produce such marvellous effects of colour; and if
      here and there a silver thread gleamed through the locks, it was lost at
      once amidst their luxuriance. His eyes were light, and his complexion,
      though without much colour, was singularly transparent. His beauty,
      indeed, would have been rather womanly than masculine, but for the height
      and sinewy spareness of a frame in which muscular strength was rather
      adorned than concealed by an admirable elegance of proportion. You would
      never have guessed this man to be an Italian; more likely you would have
      supposed him a Parisian. He conversed in French, his dress was of French
      fashion, his mode of thought seemed French. Not that he was like the
      Frenchman of the present day,&mdash;an animal, either rude or reserved;
      but your ideal of the marquis of the old regime, the roue of the Regency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Italian, however, he was, and of a race renowned in Italian history. But,
      as if ashamed of his country and his birth, he affected to be a citizen of
      the world. Heaven help the world if it hold only such citizens!
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Giulio," said Beatrice di Negra, speaking in Italian, "even granting
      that you discover this girl, can you suppose that her father will ever
      consent to your alliance? Surely you know too well the nature of your
      kinsman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tu to trompes, ma soeur," replied Giulio Franzini, Count di Peschiera, in
      French as usual,&mdash;"tu to trompes; I knew it before he had gone
      through exile and penury. How can I know it now? But comfort yourself, my
      too anxious Beatrice, I shall not care for his consent, till I 've made
      sure of his daughter's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how win that in despite of the father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, mordieu!" interrupted the count, with true French gayety; "what would
      become of all the comedies ever written, if marriages were not made in
      despite of the father? Look you," he resumed, with a very slight
      compression of his lip, and a still slighter movement in his chair,&mdash;"look
      you, this is no question of ifs and buts! it is a question of must and
      shall,&mdash;a question of existence to you and to me. When Danton was
      condemned to the guillotine, he said, flinging a pellet of bread at the
      nose of his respectable judge, 'Mon individu sera bientot dans le neant.'
      My patrimony is there already! I am loaded with debts. I see before me, on
      the one side, ruin or suicide; on the other side, wedlock and wealth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But from those vast possessions which you have been permitted to enjoy so
      long, have you really saved nothing against the time when they might be
      reclaimed at your hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sister," replied the count, "do I look like a man who saved? Besides,
      when the Austrian Emperor, unwilling to raze from his Lombard domains a
      name and a House so illustrious as our kinsman's, and desirous, while
      punishing that kinsman's rebellion, to reward my adherence, forbore the
      peremptory confiscation of those vast possessions at which my mouth waters
      while we speak, but, annexing them to the crown during pleasure, allowed
      me, as the next of male kin, to retain the revenues of one half for the
      same very indefinite period,&mdash;had I not every reason to suppose that
      before long I could so influence his Imperial Majesty, or his minister, as
      to obtain a decree that might transfer the whole, unconditionally and
      absolutely, to myself? And methinks I should have done so, but for this
      accursed, intermeddling English Milord, who has never ceased to besiege
      the court or the minister with alleged extenuations of our cousin's
      rebellion, and proofless assertions that I shared it in order to entangle
      my kinsman, and betrayed it in order to profit by his spoils. So that, at
      last, in return for all my services, and in answer to all my claims, I
      received from the minister himself this cold reply, Count of Peschiera,
      your aid was important, and your reward has been large. That reward it
      would not be for your honour to extend, and justify the ill opinion of
      your Italian countrymen by formally appropriating to yourself all that was
      forfeited by the treason you denounced. A name so noble as yours should be
      dearer to you than fortune itself.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah Giulio," cried Beatrice, her face lighting up, changed in its whole
      character, "those were words that might make the demon that tempts to
      avarice fly from your breast in shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      The count opened his eyes in great amaze; then he glanced round the room,
      and said quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody else hears you, my dear Beatrice; talk commonsense. Heroics sound
      well in mixed society; but there is nothing less suited to the tone of a
      family conversation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame di Negra bent down her head abashed, and that sudden change in the
      expression of her countenance which had seemed to betray susceptibility to
      generous emotion, faded as suddenly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But still," she said coldly, "you enjoy one half of those ample revenues:
      why talk, then, of suicide and ruin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I enjoy them at the pleasure of the crown; and what if it be the pleasure
      of the crown to recall our cousin, and reinstate him in his possessions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a probability, then, of that pardon? When you first employed me
      in your researches you only thought there was a possibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a great probability of it, and therefore I am here. I learned
      some little time since that the question of such recall had been suggested
      by the emperor, and discussed in Council. The danger to the State, which
      might arise from our cousin's wealth, his alleged abilities,&mdash;abilities!
      bah! and his popular name, deferred any decision on the point; and,
      indeed, the difficulty of dealing with myself must have embarrassed the
      minister. But it is a mere question of time. He cannot long remain
      excluded from the general amnesty already extended to the other refugees.
      The person who gave me this information is high in power, and friendly to
      myself; and he added a piece of advice on which I acted. 'It was
      intimated,' said he, 'by one of the partisans of your kinsman, that the
      exile could give a hostage for his loyalty in the person of his daughter
      and heiress; that she had arrived at marriageable age; that if she were to
      wed, with the emperor's consent, some one whose attachment to the Austrian
      crown was unquestionable, there would be a guarantee both for the faith of
      the father, and for the transmission of so important a heritage to safe
      and loyal hands. Why not' (continued my friend) 'apply to the emperor for
      his consent to that alliance for yourself,&mdash;you, on whom he can
      depend; you who, if the daughter should die, would be the legal heir to
      those lands?' On that hint I spoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw the emperor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And after combating the unjust prepossessions against me, I stated that
      so far from my cousin having any fair cause of resentment against me, when
      all was duly explained to him, I did not doubt that he would willingly
      give me the hand of his child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did!" cried the marchesa, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," continued the count, imperturbably, as he smoothed, with careless
      hand, the snowy plaits of his shirt front,&mdash;"and that I should thus
      have the happiness of becoming myself the guarantee of my kinsman's
      loyalty, the agent for the restoration of his honours, while, in the eyes
      of the envious and malignant, I should clear up my own name from all
      suspicion that I had wronged him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the emperor consented?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardieu, my dear sister, what else could his Majesty do? My proposition
      smoothed every obstacle, and reconciled policy with mercy. It remains,
      therefore, only to find out what has hitherto baffled all our researches,
      the retreat of our dear kinsfolk, and to make myself a welcome lover to
      the demoiselle. There is some disparity of years, I own; but&mdash;unless
      your sex and my glass flatter me overmuch&mdash;I am still a match for
      many a gallant of five-and-twenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      The count said this with so charming a smile, and looked so pre-eminently
      handsome, that he carried off the coxcombry of the words as gracefully as
      if they had been spoken by some dazzling hero of the grand old comedy of
      Parisian life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then interlacing his fingers and lightly leaning his hands, thus clasped,
      upon his sister's shoulder, he looked into her face, and said slowly, "And
      now, my sister, for some gentle but deserved reproach. Have you not sadly
      failed me in the task I imposed on your regard for my interests? Is it not
      some years since you first came to England on the mission of discovering
      these worthy relations of ours? Did I not entreat you to seduce into your
      toils the man whom I new to be my enemy, and who was indubitably
      acquainted with our cousin's retreat,&mdash;a secret he has hitherto
      locked within his bosom? Did you not tell me, that though he was then in
      England, you could find no occasion even to meet him, but that you had
      obtained the friendship of the statesman to whom I directed your
      attention, as his most intimate associate? And yet you, whose charms are
      usually so irresistible, learn nothing from the statesman, as you see
      nothing of Milord. Nay, baffled and misled, you actually suppose that the
      quarry has taken refuge in France. You go thither, you pretend to search
      the capital, the provinces, Switzerland, que sais je? All in vain,&mdash;though&mdash;foi
      de gentilhomme&mdash;your police cost me dearly. You return to England;
      the same chase, and the same result. Palsambleu, ma soeur, I do too much
      credit to your talents not to question your zeal. In a word, have you been
      in earnest,&mdash;or have you not had some womanly pleasure in amusing
      yourself and abusing my trust?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giulio," answered Beatrice, sadly, "you know the influence you have
      exercised over my character and my fate. Your reproaches are not just. I
      made such inquiries as were in my power, and I have now cause to believe
      that I know one who is possessed of this secret, and can guide us to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you do!" exclaimed the count. Beatrice did not heed the exclamation,
      and hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But grant that my heart shrunk from the task you imposed on me, would it
      not have been natural? When I first came to England, you informed me that
      your object in discovering the exiles was one which I could honestly aid.
      You naturally wished first to know if the daughter lived; if not, you were
      the heir. If she did, you assured me you desired to effect, through my
      mediation, some liberal compromise with Alphonso, by which you would have
      sought to obtain his restoration, provided he would leave you for life in
      possession of the grant you hold from the crown. While these were your
      objects, I did my best, ineffectual as it was, to obtain the information
      required."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what made me lose so important, though so ineffectual an ally?" asked
      the count, still smiling; but a gleam that belied the smile shot from his
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! when you bade me receive and co-operate with the miserable spies&mdash;the
      false Italians&mdash;whom you sent over, and seek to entangle this poor
      exile, when found, in some rash correspondence to be revealed to the
      court; when you sought to seduce the daughter of the Count of Peschiera,
      the descendant of those who had ruled in Italy, into the informer, the
      corrupter, and the traitress,&mdash;no, Giulio, then I recoiled; and then,
      fearful of your own sway over me, I retreated into France. I have answered
      you frankly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The count removed his hands from the shoulder on which they had reclined
      so cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this," said he, "is your wisdom, and this your gratitude! You, whose
      fortunes are bound up in mine; you, who subsist on my bounty; you, who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold," cried the marchesa, rising, and with a burst of emotion, as if
      stung to the utmost, and breaking into revolt from the tyranny of years,&mdash;"hold!
      Gratitude! bounty! Brother, brother! what, indeed, do I owe to you? The
      shame and the misery of a life. While yet a child, you condemned me to
      marry against my will, against my heart, against my prayers,&mdash;and
      laughed at my tears when I knelt to you for mercy. I was pure then,
      Giulio,&mdash;pure and innocent as the flowers in my virgin crown. And now&mdash;now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice stopped abruptly, and clasped her hands before her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you upbraid me," said the count, unruffled by her sudden passion,
      "because I gave you in marriage to a man young and noble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old in vices, and mean of soul! The marriage I forgave you. You had the
      right, according to the customs of our country, to dispose of my hand. But
      I forgave you not the consolations that you whispered in the ear of a
      wretched and insulted wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me the remark," replied the count, with a courtly bend of his
      head, "but those consolations were also conformable to the customs of our
      country, and I was not aware till now that you had wholly disdained them.
      And," continued the count, "you were not so long a wife that the gall of
      the chain should smart still. You were soon left a widow,&mdash;free,
      childless, young, beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And penniless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, Di Negra was a gambler, and very unlucky; no fault of mine. I could
      neither keep the cards from his hands, nor advise him how to play them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my own portion? O Giulio, I knew but at his death why you had
      condemned me to that renegade Genoese. He owed you money, and, against
      honour, and I believe against law, you had accepted my fortune in
      discharge of the debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had no other way to discharge it; a debt of honour must be paid,&mdash;old
      stories these. What matters? Since then my purse has been open to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, not as your sister, but your instrument, your spy! Yes, your purse
      has been open&mdash;with a niggard hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Un peu de conscience, ma chere,&mdash;you are so extravagant. But come,
      be plain. What would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would be free from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is, you would form some second marriage with one of these rich
      island lords. Ma foi, I respect your ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not so high. I aim but to escape from slavery,&mdash;to be placed
      beyond dishonourable temptation. I desire," cried Beatrice, with increased
      emotion,&mdash;"I desire to re-enter the life of woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eno'!" said the count, with a visible impatience; "is there anything in
      the attainment of your object that should render you indifferent to mine?
      You desire to marry, if I comprehend you right. And to marry as becomes
      you, you should bring to your husband not debts, but a dowry. Be it so. I
      will restore the portion that I saved from the spendthrift clutch of the
      Genoese,&mdash;the moment that it is mine to bestow, the moment that I am
      husband to my kinsman's heiress. And now, Beatrice, you imply that my
      former notions revolted your conscience; my present plan should content
      it, for by this marriage shall our kinsman regain his country, and
      repossess, at least, half his lands. And if I am not an excellent husband
      to the demoiselle, it will be her own fault. I have sown my wild oats. Je
      suis bon prince, when I have things a little my own way. It is my hope and
      my intention, and certainly it will be my interest, to become digne epoux
      et irreprochable pere de famille. I speak lightly,&mdash;'t is my way. I
      mean seriously. The little girl will be very happy with me, and I shall
      succeed in soothing all resentment her father may retain. Will you aid me
      then, yes or no? Aid me, and you shall indeed be free. The magician will
      release the fair spirit he has bound to his will. Aid me not, ma chere,
      and mark, I do not threaten&mdash;I do but warn&mdash;aid me not; grant
      that I become a beggar, and ask yourself what is to become of you,&mdash;still
      young, still beautiful, and still penniless? Nay, worse than penniless;
      you have done me the honour," and here the count, looking on the table,
      drew a letter from a portfolio emblazoned with his arms and coronet,&mdash;"you
      have done me the honour to consult me as to your debts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will restore my fortune?" said the marchesa, irresolutely,&mdash;and
      averting her head from an odious schedule of figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When my own, with your aid, is secured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do you not overrate the value of my aid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly," said the count, with a caressing suavity&mdash;and he kissed
      his sister's forehead. "Possibly; but, by my honour, I wish to repair to
      you any wrong, real or supposed, I may have done you in past times. I wish
      to find again my own dear sister. I may over-value your aid, but not the
      affection from which it comes. Let us be friends, cara Beatrice mia,"
      added the count, for the first time employing Italian words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchesa laid her head on his shoulder, and her tears flowed softly.
      Evidently this man had great influence over her,&mdash;and evidently,
      whatever her cause for complaint, her affection for him was still sisterly
      and strong. A nature with fine flashes of generosity, spirit, honour, and
      passion was hers; but uncultured, unguided, spoilt by the worst social
      examples, easily led into wrong, not always aware where the wrong was,
      letting affections good or bad whisper away her conscience or blind her
      reason. Such women are often far more dangerous when induced to wrong than
      those who are thoroughly abandoned,&mdash;such women are the accomplices
      men like the Count of Peschiera most desire to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Giulio," said Beatrice, after a pause, and looking up at him through
      her tears, "when you speak to me thus, you know you can do with me what
      you will. Fatherless and motherless, whom had my childhood to love and
      obey but you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Beatrice," murmured the count, tenderly, and he again kissed her
      forehead. "So," he continued, more carelessly,&mdash;"so the
      reconciliation is effected, and our interests and our hearts re-allied.
      Now, alas! to descend to business. You say that you know some one whom you
      believe to be acquainted with the lurking-place of my father-in-law&mdash;that
      is to be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so. You remind me that I have an appointment with him this day:
      it is near the hour,&mdash;I must leave you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To learn the secret?&mdash;Quick, quick. I have no fear of your success,
      if it is by his heart that you lead him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake; on his heart I have no hold. But he has a friend who loves
      me, and honourably, and whose cause he pleads. I think here that I have
      some means to control or persuade him. If not&mdash;ah, he is of a
      character that perplexes me in all but his worldly ambition; and how can
      we foreigners influence him through THAT?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he poor, or is he extravagant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not extravagant, and not positively poor, but dependent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we have him," said the count, composedly. "If his assistance be
      worth buying, we can bid high for it. Sur mon ame, I never yet knew money
      fail with any man who was both worldly and dependent. I put him and myself
      in your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, the count opened the door, and conducted his sister with
      formal politeness to her carriage. He then returned, reseated himself, and
      mused in silence. As he did so, the muscles of his countenance relaxed.
      The levity of the Frenchman fled from his visage, and in his eye, as it
      gazed abstractedly into space, there was that steady depth so remarkable
      in the old portraits of Florentine diplomatist or Venetian Oligarch. Thus
      seen, there was in that face, despite all its beauty, something that would
      have awed back even the fond gaze of love,&mdash;something hard,
      collected, inscrutable, remorseless. But this change of countenance did
      not last long. Evidently thought, though intense for the moment, was not
      habitual to the man; evidently he had lived the life which takes all
      things lightly,&mdash;so he rose with a look of fatigue, shook and
      stretched himself, as if to cast off, or grow out of, an unwelcome and
      irksome mood. An hour afterwards, the Count of Peschiera was charming all
      eyes, and pleasing all ears, in the saloon of a high-born beauty, whose
      acquaintance he had made at Vienna, and whose charms, according to that
      old and never-truth-speaking oracle, Polite Scandal, were now said to have
      attracted to London the brilliant foreigner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The marehesa regained her house, which was in Curzon Street, and withdrew
      to her own room, to readjust her dress, and remove from her countenance
      all trace of the tears she had shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards she was seated in her drawing-room, composed and
      calm; nor, seeing her then, could you have guessed that she was capable of
      so much emotion and so much weakness. In that stately exterior, in that
      quiet attitude, in that elaborate and finished elegance which comes alike
      from the arts of the toilet and the conventional repose of rank, you could
      see but the woman of the world and the great lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door was heard, and in a few moments there entered a
      visitor, with the easy familiarity of intimate acquaintance,&mdash;a young
      man, but with none of the bloom of youth. His hair, fine as a woman's, was
      thin and scanty, but it fell low over the forehead, and concealed that
      noblest of our human features. "A gentleman," says Apuleius, "ought to
      wear his whole mind on his forehead." The young visitor would never have
      committed so frank an imprudence. His cheek was pale, and in his step and
      his movements there was a languor that spoke of fatigued nerves or
      delicate health. But the light of the eye and the tone of the voice were
      those of a mental temperament controlling the bodily,&mdash;vigorous and
      energetic. For the rest, his general appearance was distinguished by a
      refinement alike intellectual and social. Once seen, you would not easily
      forget him; and the reader, no doubt, already recognizes Randal Leslie.
      His salutation, as I before said, was that of intimate familiarity; yet it
      was given and replied to with that unreserved openness which denotes the
      absence of a more tender sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seating himself by the marchesa's side, Randal began first to converse on
      the fashionable topics and gossip of the day; but it was observable that
      while he extracted from her the current anecdote and scandal of the great
      world, neither anecdote nor scandal did he communicate in return. Randal
      Leslie had already learned the art not to commit himself, nor to have
      quoted against him one ill-natured remark upon the eminent. Nothing more
      injures the man who would rise beyond the fame of the salons than to be
      considered backbiter and gossip; "yet it is always useful," thought Randal
      Leslie, "to know the foibles, the small social and private springs, by
      which the great are moved. Critical occasions may arise in which such a
      knowledge may be power." And hence, perhaps (besides a more private
      motive, soon to be perceived), Randal did not consider his time thrown
      away in cultivating Madame di Negra's friendship. For, despite much that
      was whispered against her, she had succeeded in dispelling the coldness
      with which she had at first been received in the London circles. Her
      beauty, her grace, and her high birth had raised her into fashion, and the
      homage of men of the first station, while it perhaps injured her
      reputation as woman, added to her celebrity as fine lady. So much do we
      cold English, prudes though we be, forgive to the foreigner what we avenge
      on the native.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sliding at last from these general topics into very well-bred and elegant
      personal compliment, and reciting various eulogies, which Lord this and
      the Duke of that had passed on the marchesa's charms, Randal laid his hand
      on hers, with the license of admitted friendship, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "But since you have deigned to confide in me, since when (happily for me,
      and with a generosity of which no coquette could have been capable) you,
      in good time, repressed into friendship feelings that might else have
      ripened into those you are formed to inspire and disdain to return, you
      told me with your charming smile, 'Let no one speak to me of love who does
      not offer me his hand, and with it the means to supply tastes that I fear
      are terribly extravagant,'&mdash;since thus you allowed me to divine your
      natural objects, and upon that understanding our intimacy has been
      founded, you will pardon me for saying that the admiration you excite
      amongst these grands seigneurs I have named only serves to defeat your own
      purpose, and scare away admirers less brilliant, but more in earnest. Most
      of these gentlemen are unfortunately married; and they who are not belong
      to those members of our aristocracy who, in marriage, seek more than
      beauty and wit,&mdash;namely, connections to strengthen their political
      station, or wealth to redeem a mortgage and sustain a title."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Leslie," replied the marchesa,&mdash;and a certain sadness
      might be detected in the tone of the voice and the droop of the eye,&mdash;"I
      have lived long enough in the real world to appreciate the baseness and
      the falsehood of most of those sentiments which take the noblest names. I
      see through the hearts of the admirers you parade before me, and know that
      not one of them would shelter with his ermine the woman to whom he talks
      of his heart. Ah," continued Beatrice, with a softness of which she was
      unconscious, but which might have been extremely dangerous to youth less
      steeled and self-guarded than was Randal Leslie's,&mdash;"ah, I am less
      ambitious than you suppose. I have dreamed of a friend, a companion, a
      protector, with feelings still fresh, undebased by the low round of vulgar
      dissipation and mean pleasures,&mdash;of a heart so new, that it might
      restore my own to what it was in its happy spring. I have seen in your
      country some marriages, the mere contemplation of which has filled my eyes
      with delicious tears. I have learned in England to know the value of home.
      And with such a heart as I describe, and such a home, I could forget that
      I ever knew a less pure ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This language does not surprise me," said Randal; "yet it does not
      harmonize with your former answer to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you," repeated Beatrice, smiling, and regaining her lighter manner;
      "to you,&mdash;true. But I never had the vanity to think that your
      affection for me could bear the sacrifices it would cost you in marriage;
      that you, with your ambition, could bound your dreams of happiness to
      home. And then, too," said she, raising her head, and with a certain grave
      pride in her air,&mdash;"and then, I could not have consented to share my
      fate with one whom my poverty would cripple. I could not listen to my
      heart, if it had beat for a lover without fortune, for to him I could then
      have brought but a burden, and betrayed him into a union with poverty and
      debt. Now, it may be different. Now I may have the dowry that befits my
      birth. And now I may be free to choose according to my heart as woman, not
      according to my necessities, as one poor, harassed, and despairing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Randal, interested, and drawing still closer towards his fair
      companion,&mdash;"ah, I congratulate you sincerely; you have cause, then,
      to think that you shall be&mdash;rich?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchesa paused before she answered, and during that pause Randal
      relaxed the web of the scheme which he had been secretly weaving, and
      rapidly considered whether, if Beatrice di Negra would indeed be rich, she
      might answer to himself as a wife; and in what way, if so, he had best
      change his tone from that of friendship into that of love. While thus
      reflecting, Beatrice answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not rich for an Englishwoman; for an Italian, yes. My fortune should be
      half a million&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half a million!" cried Randal, and with difficulty he restrained himself
      from falling at her feet in adoration. "Of francs!" continued the
      marchesa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Francs! Ah," said Randal, with a long-drawn breath, and recovering from
      his sudden enthusiasm, "about L20,000? eight hundred a year at four per
      cent. A very handsome portion, certainly (Genteel poverty!" he murmured to
      himself. "What an escape I have had! but I see&mdash;I see. This will
      smooth all difficulties in the way of my better and earlier project. I
      see),&mdash;a very handsome portion," he repeated aloud,&mdash;"not for a
      grand seigneur, indeed, but still for a gentleman of birth and
      expectations worthy of your choice, if ambition be not your first object.
      Ah, while you spoke with such endearing eloquence of feelings that were
      fresh, of a heart that was new, of the happy English home, you might guess
      that my thoughts ran to my friend who loves you so devotedly, and who so
      realizes your ideal. Proverbially, with us, happy marriages and happy
      homes are found not in the gay circles of London fashion, but at the
      hearths of our rural nobility, our untitled country gentlemen. And who,
      amongst all your adorers, can offer you a lot so really enviable as the
      one whom, I see by your blush, you already guess that I refer to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I blush?" said the marchesa, with a silvery laugh. "Nay, I think that
      your zeal for your friend misled you. But I will own frankly, I have been
      touched by his honest ingenuous love,&mdash;so evident, yet rather looked
      than spoken. I have contrasted the love that honours me with the suitors
      that seek to degrade; more I cannot say. For though I grant that your
      friend is handsome, high-spirited, and generous, still he is not what&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake, believe me," interrupted Randal. "You shall not finish your
      sentence. He is all that you do not yet suppose him; for his shyness, and
      his very love, his very respect for your superiority, do not allow his
      mind and his nature to appear to advantage. You, it is true, have a taste
      for letters and poetry rare among your countrywomen. He has not at present&mdash;few
      men have. But what Cimon would not be refined by so fair an Iphigenia?
      Such frivolities as he now shows belong but to youth and inexperience of
      life. Happy the brother who could see his sister the wife of Frank
      Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchesa leaned her cheek on her hand in silence. To her, marriage was
      more than it usually seems to dreaming maiden or to disconsolate widow. So
      had the strong desire to escape from the control of her unprincipled and
      remorseless brother grown a part of her very soul; so had whatever was
      best and highest in her very mixed and complex character been galled and
      outraged by her friendless and exposed position, the equivocal worship
      rendered to her beauty, the various debasements to which pecuniary
      embarrassments had subjected her&mdash;not without design on the part of
      the count, who though grasping, was not miserly, and who by precarious and
      seemingly capricious gifts at one time, and refusals of all aid at
      another, had involved her in debt in order to retain his hold on her; so
      utterly painful and humiliating to a woman of her pride and her birth was
      the station that she held in the world,&mdash;that in marriage she saw
      liberty, life, honour, self-redemption; and these thoughts, while they
      compelled her to co-operate with the schemes by which the count, on
      securing to himself a bride, was to bestow on herself a dower, also
      disposed her now to receive with favour Randal Leslie's pleadings on
      behalf of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advocate saw that he had made an impression, and with the marvellous
      skill which his knowledge of those natures that engaged his study bestowed
      on his intelligence, he continued to improve his cause by such
      representations as were likely to be most effective. With what admirable
      tact he avoided panegyric of Frank as the mere individual, and drew him
      rather as the type, the ideal of what a woman in Beatrice's position might
      desire, in the safety, peace, and Honour of a home, in the trust and
      constancy and honest confiding love of its partner! He did not paint an
      elysium,&mdash;he described a haven; he did not glowingly delineate a hero
      of romance,&mdash;he soberly portrayed that Representative of the
      Respectable and the Real which a woman turns to when romance begins to
      seem to her but delusion. Verily, if you could have looked into the heart
      of the person he addressed, and heard him speak, you would have cried
      admiringly, "Knowledge is power; and this man, if as able on a larger
      field of action, should play no mean part in the history of his time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Beatrice roused herself from the reveries which crept over her as
      he spoke,&mdash;slowly, and with a deep sigh, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, grant all you say! at least before I can listen to so
      honourable a love, I must be relieved from the base and sordid pleasure
      that weighs on me. I cannot say to the man who wooes me, 'Will you pay the
      debts of the daughter of Franzini, and the widow of Di Negra?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, your debts, surely, make so slight a portion of your dowry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the dowry has to be secured;" and here, turning the tables upon her
      companion, as the apt proverb expresses it, Madame di Negra extended her
      hand to Randal, and said in the most winning accents, "You are, then,
      truly and sincerely my friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you doubt it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prove that I do not, for I ask your assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine? How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen; my brother has arrived in London&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see that arrival announced in the papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he comes, empowered by the consent of the emperor, to ask the hand of
      a relation and countrywoman of his,&mdash;an alliance that will heal long
      family dissensions, and add to his own fortunes those of an heiress. My
      brother, like myself, has been extravagant. The dowry which by law he
      still owes me it would distress him to pay till this marriage be assured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said Randal. "But how can I aid this marriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By assisting us to discover the bride. She, with her father, sought
      refuge and concealment in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The father had, then, taken part in some political disaffections, and was
      proscribed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly; and so well has he concealed himself, that he has baffled all
      our efforts to discover his retreat. My brother can obtain him his pardon
      in cementing this alliance&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Randal, Randal, is this the frankness of friendship? You know that I
      have before sought to obtain the secret of our relation's retreat,&mdash;sought
      in vain to obtain it from Mr. Egerton, who assuredly knows it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who communicates no secrets to living man," said Randal, almost
      bitterly; "who, close and compact as iron, is as little malleable to me as
      to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me. I know you so well that I believe you could attain to any
      secret you sought earnestly to acquire. Nay, more, I believe that you know
      already that secret which I ask you to share with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What on earth makes you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When, some weeks ago, you asked me to describe the personal appearance
      and manners of the exile, which I did partly from the recollections of my
      childhood, partly from the description given to me by others, I could not
      but notice your countenance, and remark its change; in spite," said the
      marchesa, smiling, and watching Randal while she spoke,&mdash;"in spite of
      your habitual self-command. And when I pressed you to own that you had
      actually seen some one who tallied with that description, your denial did
      not deceive me. Still more, when returning recently, of your own accord,
      to the subject, you questioned me so shrewdly as to my motives in seeking
      the clew to our refugees, and I did not then answer you satisfactorily, I
      could detect&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha," interrupted Randal, with the low soft laugh by which
      occasionally he infringed upon Lord Chesterfield's recommendations to shun
      a merriment so natural as to be illbred,&mdash;"ha, ha, you have the fault
      of all observers too minute and refined. But even granting that I may have
      seen some Italian exiles (which is likely enough), what could be more
      natural than my seeking to compare your description with their appearance;
      and granting that I might suspect some one amongst them to be the man you
      search for, what more natural also than that I should desire to know if
      you meant him harm or good in discovering his 'whereabout'? For ill,"
      added Randal, with an air of prudery,&mdash;"ill would it become me to
      betray, even to friendship, the retreat of one who would hide from
      persecution; and even if I did so&mdash;for honour itself is a weak
      safeguard against your fascinations&mdash;such indiscretion might be fatal
      to my future career."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not say that Egerton knows the secret, yet will not communicate;
      and is he a man who would ever forgive in me an imprudence that committed
      himself? My dear friend, I will tell you more. When Audley Egerton first
      noticed my growing intimacy with you, he said, with his usual dryness of
      counsel, 'Randal, I do not ask you to discontinue acquaintance with Madame
      di Negra, for an acquaintance with women like her forms the manners, and
      refines the intellect; but charming women are dangerous, and Madame di
      Negra is&mdash;a charming woman.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchesa's face flushed. Randal resumed: "'Your fair acquaintance' (I
      am still quoting Egerton) 'seeks to dis cover the home of a countryman of
      hers. She suspects that I know it. She may try to learn it through you.
      Accident may possibly give you the information she requires. Beware how
      you betray it. By one such weakness I should judge of your general
      character. He from whom a woman can extract a secret will never be fit for
      public life.' Therefore, my dear marchesa, even supposing I possess this
      secret, you would be no true friend of mine to ask me to reveal what would
      imperil all my prospects. For as yet," added Randal, with a gloomy shade
      on his brow,&mdash;"as yet, I do not stand alone and erect,&mdash;I lean,
      I am dependent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There may be a way," replied Madame di Negra, persisting, "to communicate
      this intelligence without the possibility of Mr. Egerton's tracing our
      discovery to yourself; and, though I will not press you further, I add
      this,&mdash;You urge me to accept your friend's hand; you seem interested
      in the success of his suit, and you plead it with a warmth that shows how
      much you regard what you suppose is his happiness; I will never accept his
      hand till I can do so without blush for my penury,&mdash;till my dowry is
      secured; and that can only be by my brother's union with the exile's
      daughter. For your friend's sake, therefore, think well how you can aid me
      in the first step to that alliance. The young lady once discovered, and my
      brother has no fear for the success of his suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you would marry Frank if the dower was secured?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your arguments in his favour seem irresistible," replied Beatrice,
      looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flash went from Randal's eyes, and he mused a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then slowly rising, and drawing on his gloves, he said, "Well, at least
      you so far reconcile my honour towards aiding your research, that you now
      inform me you mean no ill to the exile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ill!&mdash;the restoration to fortune, honours, his native land!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you so far enlist my heart on your side, that you inspire me with the
      hope to contribute to the happiness of two friends whom I dearly love. I
      will, therefore, diligently try to ascertain if, among the refugees I have
      met with, lurk those whom you seek; and if so, I will thoughtfully
      consider how to give you the clew. Meanwhile, not one incautious word to
      Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust me,&mdash;I am a woman of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal now had gained the door. He paused, and renewed carelessly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "This young lady must be heiress to great wealth, to induce a man of your
      brother's rank to take so much pains to discover her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her wealth will be vast," replied the marchesa; "and if anything from
      wealth or influence in a foreign State could be permitted to prove my
      brother's gratitude&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, fie!" interrupted Randal; and, approaching Madame di Negra, he lifted
      her hand to his lips, and said gallantly, "This is reward enough to your
      preux chevalier."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words he took his leave.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      With his hands behind him, and his head drooping on his breast, slow,
      stealthy, noiseless, Randal Leslie glided along the streets on leaving the
      Italian's house. Across the scheme he had before revolved, there glanced
      another yet more glittering, for its gain might be more sure and
      immediate. If the exile's daughter were heiress to such wealth, might he
      himself hope&mdash;He stopped short even in his own soliloquy, and his
      breath came quick. Now, in his last visit to Hazeldean, he had come in
      contact with Riccabocca, and been struck by the beauty of Violante. A
      vague suspicion had crossed him that these might be the persons of whom
      the marchesa was in search, and the suspicion had been confirmed by
      Beatrice's description of the refugee she desired to discover. But as he
      had not then learned the reason for her inquiries, nor conceived the
      possibility that he could have any personal interest in ascertaining the
      truth, he had only classed the secret in question among those the further
      research into which might be left to time and occasion. Certainly the
      reader will not do the unscrupulous intellect of Randal Leslie the
      injustice to suppose that he was deterred from confiding to his fair
      friend all that he knew of Riccabocca by the refinement of honour to which
      he had so chivalrously alluded. He had correctly stated Audley Egerton's
      warning against any indiscreet confidence, though he had forborne to
      mention a more recent and direct renewal of the same caution. His first
      visit to Hazeldean had been paid without consulting Egerton. He had been
      passing some days at his father's house, and had gone over thence to the
      squire's. On his return to London, he had, however, mentioned this visit
      to Audley, who had seemed annoyed and even displeased at it, though Randal
      knew sufficient of Egerton's character to guess that such feelings could
      scarce be occasioned merely by his estrangement from his half-brother.
      This dissatisfaction had, therefore, puzzled the young man. But as it was
      necessary to his views to establish intimacy with the squire, he did not
      yield the point with his customary deference to his patron's whims.
      Accordingly he observed that he should be very sorry to do anything
      displeasing to his benefactor, but that his father had been naturally
      anxious that he should not appear positively to slight the friendly
      overtures of Mr. Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why naturally?" asked Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you know that Mr. Hazeldean is a relation of mine,&mdash;that my
      grandmother was a Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Egerton, who, as it has been before said, knew little and cared
      less about the Hazeldean pedigree, "I was either not aware of that
      circumstance, or had forgotten it. And your father thinks that the squire
      may leave you a legacy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, my father is not so mercenary,&mdash;such an idea never entered
      his head. But the squire himself has indeed said, 'Why, if anything
      happened to Frank, you would be next heir to my lands, and therefore we
      ought to know each other.' But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," interrupted Egerton. "I am the last man to pretend to the right
      of standing between you and a single chance of fortune, or of aid to it.
      And whom did you meet at Hazeldean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no one there, sir; not even Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum. Is the squire not on good terms with his parson? Any quarrel about
      tithes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no quarrel. I forgot Mr. Dale; I saw him pretty often. He admires and
      praises you very much, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me&mdash;and why? What did he say of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That your heart was as sound as your head; that he had once seen you
      about some old parishioners of his, and that he had been much impressed
      with the depth of feeling he could not have anticipated in a man of the
      world, and a statesman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that was all; some affair when I was member for Lansmere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the conversation had broken off; but the next time Randal was led to
      visit the squire he had formally asked Egerton's consent, who, after a
      moment's hesitation, had as formally replied, "I have no objection."
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning from this visit, Randal mentioned that he had seen
      Riccabocca: and Egerton, a little startled at first, said composedly,
      "Doubtless one of the political refugees; take care not to set Madame di
      Negra on his track. Remember, she is suspected of being a spy of the
      Austrian government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rely on me, sir," said Randal; "but I should think this poor doctor can
      scarcely be the person she seeks to discover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is no affair of ours," answered Egerton: "we are English gentlemen,
      and make not a step towards the secrets of another."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when Randal revolved this rather ambiguous answer, and recalled the
      uneasiness with which Egerton had first heard of his visit to Hazeldean,
      he thought that he was indeed near the secret which Egerton desired to
      conceal from him and from all,&mdash;namely, the incognito of the Italian
      whom Lord L'Estrange had taken under his protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My cards," said Randal to himself, as with a deep-drawn sigh he resumed
      his soliloquy, "are become difficult to play. On the one hand, to entangle
      Frank into marriage with this foreigner, the squire could never forgive
      him. On the other hand, if she will not marry him without the dowry&mdash;and
      that depends on her brother's wedding this countrywoman&mdash;and that
      countrywoman be, as I surmise, Violante, and Violante be this heiress, and
      to be won by me! Tush, tush. Such delicate scruples in a woman so placed
      and so constituted as Beatrice di Negra must be easily talked away. Nay,
      the loss itself of this alliance to her brother, the loss of her own
      dowry, the very pressure of poverty and debt, would compel her into the
      sole escape left to her option. I will then follow up the old plan; I will
      go down to Hazeldean, and see if there be any substance in the new one;
      and then to reconcile both. Aha&mdash;the House of Leslie shall rise yet
      from its ruin&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was startled from his revery by a friendly slap on the shoulder,
      and an exclamation, "Why, Randal, you are more absent than when you used
      to steal away from the cricket-ground, muttering Greek verses, at Eton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Frank," said Randal, "you&mdash;you are so brusque, and I was
      just thinking of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you? And kindly, then, I am sure," said Frank Hazeldean, his honest
      handsome face lighted up with the unsuspecting genial trust of friendship;
      "and Heaven knows," he added, with a sadder voice, and a graver expression
      on his eye and lip,&mdash;"Heaven knows I want all the kindness you can
      give me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought," said Randal, "that your father's last supply, of which I was
      fortunate enough to be the bearer, would clear off your more pressing
      debts. I don't pretend to preach, but really, I must say once more, you
      should not be so extravagant."
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (seriously).&mdash;"I have done my best to reform. I have sold off
      my horses, and I have not touched dice nor card these six months; I would
      not even put into the raffle for the last Derby." This last was said with
      the air of a man who doubted the possibility of obtaining belief to some
      assertion of preternatural abstinence and virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Is it possible? But with such self-conquest, how is it that
      you cannot contrive to live within the bounds of a very liberal
      allowance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (despondingly).&mdash;"Why, when a man once gets his head under
      water, it is so hard to float back again on the surface. You see, I
      attribute all my embarrassments to that first concealment of my debts from
      my father, when they could have been so easily met, and when he came up to
      town so kindly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry, then, that I gave you that advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you meant it so kindly, I don't reproach you; it was all my own
      fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, indeed, I did urge you to pay off that moiety of your debts left
      unpaid, with your allowance. Had you done so, all had been well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but poor Borrowell got into such a scrape at Goodwood, I could not
      resist him; a debt of honour,&mdash;that must be paid; so when I signed
      another bill for him, he could not pay it, poor fellow! Really he would
      have shot himself, if I had not renewed it. And now it is swelled to such
      an amount with that cursed interest, that he never can pay it; and one
      bill, of course, begets another,&mdash;and to be renewed every three
      months; 't is the devil and all! So little as I ever got for all I have
      borrowed," added Frank, with a kind of rueful amaze. "Not L1,500 ready
      money; and the interest would cost me almost as much yearly,&mdash;if I
      had it." "Only L1,500!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well; besides seven large chests of the worst cigars you ever smoked,
      three pipes of wine that no one would drink, and a great bear that had
      been imported from Greenland for the sake of its grease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That should, at least, have saved you a bill with your hairdresser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I paid his bill with it," said Frank, "and very good-natured he was to
      take the monster off my hands,&mdash;it had already hugged two soldiers
      and one groom into the shape of a flounder. I tell you what," resumed
      Frank, after a short pause, "I have a great mind even now to tell my
      father honestly all my embarrassments."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (solemnly).&mdash;"Hum!"
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK.&mdash;"What? don't you think it would be the best way? I never can
      save enough,&mdash;never can pay off what I owe; and it rolls like a
      snowball."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Judging by the squire's talk, I think that with the first
      sight of your affairs you would forfeit his favour forever; and your
      mother would be so shocked, especially after supposing that the sum I
      brought you so lately sufficed to pay off every claim on you. If you had
      not assured her of that it might be different; but she, who so hates an
      untruth, and who said to the squire, 'Frank says this will clear him; and
      with all his faults, Frank never yet told a lie!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear mother!&mdash;I fancy I hear her!" cried Frank, with deep
      emotion. "But I did not tell a lie, Randal; I did not say that that sum
      would clear me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You empowered and begged me to say so," replied Randal, with grave
      coldness; "and don't blame me if I believed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! I only said it would clear me for the moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I misunderstood you, then, sadly; and such mistakes involve my own
      honour. Pardon me, Frank; don't ask my aid in future. You see, with the
      best intentions, I only compromise myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you forsake me, I may as well go and throw myself into the river,"
      said Frank, in a tone of despair; "and sooner or later, my father must
      know my necessities. The Jews threaten to go to him already; and the
      longer the delay, the more terrible the explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why your father should ever learn the state of your affairs;
      and it seems to me that you could pay off these usurers, and get rid of
      these bills, by raising money on comparatively easy terms&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?" cried Frank, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the Casino property is entailed on you, and you might obtain a sum
      upon that, not to be paid till the property becomes yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At my poor father's death? Oh, no, no! I cannot bear the idea of this
      cold-blooded calculation on a father's death. I know it is not uncommon; I
      know other fellows who have done it, but they never had parents so kind as
      mine; and even in them it shocked and revolted me. The contemplating a
      father's death, and profiting by the contemplation it seems a kind of
      parricide: it is not natural, Randal. Besides, don't you remember what the
      Governor said,&mdash;he actually wept while he said it,&mdash;'Never
      calculate on my death; I could not bear that.' Oh, Randal, don't speak of
      it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I respect your sentiments; but still, all the post-orbits you could raise
      could not shorten Mr. Hazeldean's life by a day. However, dismiss that
      idea; we must think of some other device. Ha, Frank! you are a handsome
      fellow, and your expectations are great&mdash;why don't you marry some
      woman with money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" exclaimed Frank, colouring. "You know, Randal, that there is but
      one woman in the world I can ever think of; and I love her so devotedly,
      that, though I was as gay as most men before, I really feel as if the rest
      of her sex had lost every charm. I was passing through the street now&mdash;merely
      to look up at her windows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak of Madame di Negra? I have just left her. Certainly, she is two
      or three years older than you; but if you can get over that misfortune,
      why not marry her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry her!" cried Frank, in amaze, and all his colour fled from his
      cheeks. "Marry her! Are you serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But even if she, who is so accomplished, so admired, even if she would
      accept me, she is, you know, poorer than myself. She has told me so
      frankly. That woman has such a noble heart,&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;my
      father would never consent, nor my mother either. I know they would not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because she is a foreigner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;partly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet the squire suffered his cousin to marry a foreigner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was different. He had no control over Jemima; and a daughter-in-law
      is so different; and my father is so English in his notions; and Madame di
      Negra, you see, is altogether so foreign. Her very graces would be against
      her in his eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you do both your parents injustice. A foreigner of low birth&mdash;an
      actress or singer, for instance&mdash;of course would be highly
      objectionable; but a woman like Madame di Negra, of such high birth and
      connections&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank shook his head. "I don't think the Governor would care a straw about
      her connections, if she were a king's daughter. He considers all
      foreigners pretty much alike. And then, you know" (Frank's voice sank into
      a whisper),&mdash;"you know that one of the very reasons why she is so
      dear to me would be an insuperable objection to the old-fashioned folks at
      home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you, Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love her the more," said young Hazeldean, raising his front with a
      noble pride, that seemed to speak of his descent from a race of cavaliers
      and gentlemen,&mdash;"I love her the more because the world has slandered
      her name,&mdash;because I believe her to be pure and wronged. But would
      they at the Hall,&mdash;they who do not see with a lover's eyes, they who
      have all the stubborn English notions about the indecorum and license of
      Continental manners, and will so readily credit the worst? Oh, no! I love,
      I cannot help it&mdash;but I have no hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very possible that you may be right," exclaimed Randal, as if
      struck and half convinced by his companion's argument,&mdash;"very
      possible; and certainly I think that the homely folks at the Hall would
      fret and fume at first, if they heard you were married to Madame di Negra.
      Yet still, when your father learned that you had done so, not from passion
      alone, but to save him from all pecuniary sacrifice,&mdash;to clear
      yourself of debt, to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" exclaimed Frank, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have reason to know that Madame di Negra will have as large a portion
      as your father could reasonably expect you to receive with any English
      wife. And when this is properly stated to the squire, and the high
      position and rank of your wife fully established and brought home to him,&mdash;for
      I must think that these would tell, despite your exaggerated notions of
      his prejudices,&mdash;and then, when he really sees Madame di Negra, and
      can judge of her beauty and rare gifts, upon my word, I think, Frank, that
      there would be no cause for fear. After all, too, you are his only son. He
      will have no option but to forgive you; and I know how anxiously both your
      parents wish to see you settled in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank's whole countenance became illuminated. "There is no one who
      understands the squire like you, certainly," said he, with lively joy. "He
      has the highest opinion of your judgment. And you really believe you could
      smooth matters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so; but I should be sorry to induce you to run any risk; and
      if, on cool consideration, you think that risk is incurred, I strongly
      advise you to avoid all occasion of seeing the poor marchesa. Ah, you
      wince; but I say it for her sake as well as your own. First, you must be
      aware, that, unless you have serious thoughts of marriage, your attentions
      can but add to the very rumours that, equally groundless, you so feelingly
      resent; and, secondly, because I don't think any man has a right to win
      the affections of a woman&mdash;especially a woman who seems to me likely
      to love with her whole heart and soul&mdash;merely to gratify his own
      vanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vanity! Good heavens! can you think so poorly of me? But as to the
      marchesa's affections," continued Frank, with a faltering voice, "do you
      really and honestly believe that they are to be won by me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear lest they may be half won already," said Randal, with a smile and
      a shake of the head; "but she is too proud to let you see any effect you
      may produce on her, especially when, as I take it for granted, you have
      never hinted at the hope of obtaining her hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never till now conceived such a hope. My dear Randal, all my cares have
      vanished! I tread upon air! I have a great mind to call on her at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, stay," said Randal. "Let me give you a caution. I have just
      informed you that Madame di Negra will have, what you suspected not
      before, a fortune suitable to her birth. Any abrupt change in your manner
      at present might induce her to believe that you were influenced by that
      intelligence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed Frank, stopping short, as if wounded to the quick. "And I
      feel guilty,&mdash;feel as if I was influenced by that intelligence. So I
      am, too, when I reflect," he continued, with a naivete that was half
      pathetic; "but I hope she will not be very rich; if so, I'll not call."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make your mind easy, it is but a portion of some twenty or thirty
      thousand pounds, that would just suffice to discharge all your debts,
      clear away all obstacle to your union, and in return for which you could
      secure a more than adequate jointure and settlement on the Casino
      property. Now I am on that head, I will be yet more communicative. Madame
      di Negra has a noble heart, as you say, and told me herself, that, until
      her brother on his arrival had assured her of this dowry, she would never
      have consented to marry you, never crippled with her own embarrassments
      the man she loves. Ah! with what delight she will hail the thought of
      assisting you to win back your father's heart! But be guarded meanwhile.
      And now, Frank, what say you&mdash;would it not be well if I ran down to
      Hazeldean to sound your parents? It is rather inconvenient to me, to be
      sure, to leave town just at present; but I would do more than that to
      render you a smaller service. Yes, I'll go to Rood Hall to-morrow, and
      thence to Hazeldean. I am sure your father will press me to stay, and I
      shall have ample opportunities to judge of the manner in which he would be
      likely to regard your marriage with Madame di Negra,&mdash;supposing
      always it were properly put to him. We can then act accordingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, dear Randal, how can I thank you? If ever a poor fellow like me
      can serve you in return&mdash;but that's impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, certainly, I will never ask you to be security to a bill of mine,"
      said Randal, laughing. "I practise the economy I preach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Frank, with a groan, "that is because your mind is cultivated,&mdash;you
      have so many resources; and all my faults have come from idleness. If I
      had had anything to do on a rainy day, I should never have got into these
      scrapes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you will have enough to do some day managing your property. We who
      have no property must find one in knowledge. Adieu, my dear Frank, I must
      go home now. By the way, you have never, by chance, spoken of the
      Riccaboccas to Madame di Negra."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Riccaboccas? No. That's well thought of. It may interest her to know
      that a relation of mine has married her countryman. Very odd that I never
      did mention it; but, to say truth, I really do talk so little to her: she
      is so superior, and I feel positively shy with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me the favour, Frank," said Randal, waiting patiently till this reply
      ended,&mdash;for he was devising all the time what reason to give for his
      request,&mdash;"never to allude to the Riccaboccas either to her or to her
      brother, to whom you are sure to be presented."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not allude to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal hesitated a moment. His invention was still at fault, and, for a
      wonder, he thought it the best policy to go pretty near the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I will tell you. The marchesa conceals nothing from her brother, and
      he is one of the few Italians who are in high favour with the Austrian
      court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I suspect that poor Dr. Riccabocca fled his country from some mad
      experiment at revolution, and is still hiding from the Austrian police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they can't hurt him here," said Frank, with an Englishman's dogged
      inborn conviction of the sanctity of his native island. "I should like to
      see an Austrian pretend to dictate to us whom to receive and whom to
      reject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum&mdash;that's true and constitutional, no doubt; but Riccabocca may
      have excellent reasons&mdash;and, to speak plainly, I know he has (perhaps
      as affecting the safety of friends in Italy)&mdash;for preserving his
      incognito, and we are bound to respect those reasons without inquiring
      further."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still I cannot think so meanly of Madame di Negra," persisted Frank
      (shrewd here, though credulous elsewhere, and both from his sense of
      honour), "as to suppose that she would descend to be a spy, and injure a
      poor countryman of her own, who trusts to the same hospitality she
      receives herself at our English hands. Oh, if I thought that, I could not
      love her!" added Frank, with energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly you are right. But see in what a false position you would place
      both her brother and herself. If they knew Riccabocca's secret, and
      proclaimed it to the Austrian Government, as you say, it would be cruel
      and mean; but if they knew it and concealed it, it might involve them both
      in the most serious consequences. You know the Austrian policy is
      proverbially so jealous and tyrannical?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the newspapers say so, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, in short, your discretion can do no harm, and your indiscretion may.
      Therefore, give me your word, Frank. I can't stay to argue now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not allude to the Riccaboccas, upon my honour," answered Frank;
      "still, I am sure that they would be as safe with the marchesa as with&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rely on your honour," interrupted Randal, hastily, and hurried off.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Towards the evening of the following day, Randal Leslie walked slowly from
      a village in the main road (about two miles from Rood Hall), at which he
      had got out of the coach. He passed through meads and cornfields, and by
      the skirts of woods which had formerly belonged to his ancestors, but had
      been long since alienated. He was alone amidst the haunts of his boyhood,
      the scenes in which he had first invoked the grand Spirit of Knowledge, to
      bid the Celestial Still One minister to the commands of an earthly and
      turbulent ambition. He paused often in his path, especially when the
      undulations of the ground gave a glimpse of the gray church tower, or the
      gloomy firs that rose above the desolate wastes of Rood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," thought Randal, with a softening eye,&mdash;"here, how often,
      comparing the fertility of the lands passed away from the inheritance of
      my fathers, with the forlorn wilds that are left to their mouldering Hall,&mdash;here
      how often have I said to myself, 'I will rebuild the fortunes of my
      House.' And straightway Toil lost its aspect of drudge, and grew kingly,
      and books became as living armies to serve my thought. Again&mdash;again O
      thou haughty Past, brace and strengthen me in the battle with the Future."
      His pale lips writhed as he soliloquized, for his conscience spoke to him
      while he thus addressed his will, and its voice was heard more audibly in
      the quiet of the rural landscape, than amidst the turmoil and din of that
      armed and sleepless camp which we call a city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless, though Ambition have objects more vast and beneficent than the
      restoration of a name, that in itself is high and chivalrous, and appeals
      to a strong interest in the human heart. But all emotions and all ends of
      a nobler character had seemed to filter themselves free from every golden
      grain in passing through the mechanism of Randal's intellect, and came
      forth at last into egotism clear and unalloyed. Nevertheless, it is a
      strange truth that, to a man of cultivated mind, however perverted and
      vicious, there are vouchsafed gleams of brighter sentiments, irregular
      perceptions of moral beauty, denied to the brutal unreasoning wickedness
      of uneducated villany,&mdash;which perhaps ultimately serve as his
      punishment, according to the old thought of the satirist, that there is no
      greater curse than to perceive virtue yet adopt vice. And as the solitary
      schemer walked slowly on, and his childhood&mdash;innocent at least indeed&mdash;came
      distinct before him through the halo of bygone dreams,&mdash;dreams far
      purer than those from which he now rose each morning to the active world
      of Man,&mdash;a profound melancholy crept over him, and suddenly he
      exclaimed aloud, "Then I aspired to be renowned and great; now, how is it
      that, so advanced in my career, all that seemed lofty in the end has
      vanished from me, and the only means that I contemplate are those which my
      childhood would have called poor and vile? Ah, is it that I then read but
      books, and now my knowledge has passed onward, and men contaminate more
      than books? But," he continued, in a lower voice, as if arguing with
      himself, "if power is only so to be won,&mdash;and of what use is
      knowledge if it be not power&mdash;does not success in life justify all
      things? And who prizes the wise man if he fails?" He continued his way,
      but still the soft tranquillity around rebuked him, and still his reason
      was dissatisfied, as well as his conscience. There are times when Nature,
      like a bath of youth, seems to restore to the jaded soul its freshness,&mdash;times
      from which some men have emerged, as if reborn. The crises of life are
      very silent. Suddenly the scene opened on Randal Leslie's eyes,&mdash;the
      bare desert common, the dilapidated church, the old house, partially seen
      in the dank dreary hollow, into which it seemed to Randal to have sunken
      deeper and lowlier than when he saw it last. And on the common were some
      young men playing at hockey. That old-fashioned game, now very uncommon in
      England, except at schools, was still preserved in the primitive vicinity
      of Rood by the young yeomen and farmers. Randal stood by the stile and
      looked on, for among the players he recognized his brother Oliver.
      Presently the ball was struck towards Oliver, and the group instantly
      gathered round that young gentleman, and snatched him from Randal's eye;
      but the elder brother heard a displeasing din, a derisive laughter. Oliver
      had shrunk from the danger of the thick clubbed sticks that plied around
      him, and received some stroke across the legs, for his voice rose whining,
      and was drowned by shouts of, "Go to your mammy. That's Noll Leslie all
      over. Butter shins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's sallow face became scarlet. "The jest of boors&mdash;a Leslie!"
      he muttered, and ground his teeth. He sprang over the stile, and walked
      erect and haughtily across the ground. The players cried out indignantly.
      Randal raised his hat, and they recognized him, and stopped the game. For
      him at least a certain respect was felt. Oliver turned round quickly, and
      ran up to him. Randal caught his arm firmly, and without saying a word to
      the rest, drew him away towards the house. Oliver cast a regretful,
      lingering look behind him, rubbed his shins, and then stole a timid glance
      towards Randal's severe and moody countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not angry that I was playing at hockey with our neighbours," said
      he, deprecatingly, observing that Randal would not break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the elder brother; "but in associating with his inferiors, a
      gentleman still knows how to maintain his dignity. There is no harm in
      playing with inferiors, but it is necessary to a gentleman to play so that
      he is not the laughing-stock of clowns."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver hung his head, and made no answer. They came into the slovenly
      precincts of the court, and the pigs stared at them from the palings, as
      their progenitors had stared, years before, at Frank Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Leslie, senior, in a shabby straw-hat, was engaged in feeding the
      chickens before the threshold, and he performed even that occupation with
      a maundering lack-a-daisical slothfulness, dropping down the grains almost
      one by one from his inert dreamy fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's sister, her hair still and forever hanging about her ears, was
      seated on a rush-bottom chair, reading a tattered novel; and from the
      parlour window was heard the querulous voice of Mrs. Leslie, in high
      fidget and complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other, as the young heir to all this helpless poverty stood in
      the courtyard, with his sharp, refined, intelligent features, and his
      strange elegance of dress and aspect, one better comprehended how, left
      solely to the egotism of his knowledge and his ambition, in such a family,
      and without any of the sweet nameless lessons of Home, he had grown up
      into such close and secret solitude of soul,&mdash;how the mind had taken
      so little nutriment from the heart, and how that affection and respect
      which the warm circle of the heart usually calls forth had passed with him
      to the graves of dead fathers, growing, as it were, bloodless and
      ghoul-like amidst the charnels on which they fed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, Randal, boy," said Mr. Leslie, looking up lazily, "how d' ye do? Who
      could have expected you? My dear, my dear," he cried, in a broken voice,
      and as if in helpless dismay, "here's Randal, and he'll be wanting dinner,
      or supper, or something." But, in the mean while, Randal's sister Juliet
      had sprung up and thrown her arms round her brother's neck, and he had
      drawn her aside caressingly, for Randal's strongest human affection was
      for this sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are growing very pretty, Juliet," said he, smoothing back her hair;
      "why do yourself such injustice,&mdash;why not pay more attention to your
      appearance, as I have so often begged you to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not expect you, dear Randal; you always come so suddenly, and catch
      us en dish-a-bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dish-a-bill!" echoed Randal, with a groan. "Dishabille! you ought never
      to be so caught!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one else does so catch us,&mdash;nobody else ever comes. Heigho!" and
      the young lady sighed very heartily. "Patience, patience; my day is
      coming, and then yours, my sister," replied Randal, with genuine pity, as
      he gazed upon what a little care could have trained into so fair a flower,
      and what now looked so like a weed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mrs. Leslie, in a state of intense excitement&mdash;having rushed
      through the parlour, leaving a fragment of her gown between the yawning
      brass of the never-mended Brummagem work-table&mdash;tore across the hall,
      whirled out of the door, scattering the chickens to the right and left,
      and clutched hold of Randal in her motherly embrace. "La, how you do shake
      my nerves," she cried, after giving him a most hasty and uncomfortable
      kiss. "And you are hungry too, and nothing in the house but cold mutton!
      Jenny, Jenny, I say, Jenny! Juliet, have you seen Jenny? Where's Jenny?
      Out with the odd man, I'll be bound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not hungry, Mother," said Randal; "I wish for nothing but tea."
      Juliet, scrambling up her hair, darted into the house to prepare the tea,
      and also to "tidy herself." She dearly loved her fine brother, but she was
      greatly in awe of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal seated himself on the broken pales. "Take care they don't come
      down," said Mr. Leslie, with some anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Sir, I am very light; nothing comes down with me." The pigs stared
      up, and grunted in amaze at the stranger. "Mother," said the young man,
      detaining Mrs. Leslie, who wanted to set off in chase of Jenny, "Mother,
      you should not let Oliver associate with those village boors. It is time
      to think of a profession for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he eats us out of house and home&mdash;such an appetite! But as to a
      profession, what is he fit for? He will never be a scholar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal nodded a moody assent; for, indeed, Oliver had been sent to
      Cambridge, and supported there out of Randal's income from his official
      pay; and Oliver had been plucked for his Little Go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the army," said the elder brother,&mdash;"a gentleman's calling.
      How handsome Juliet ought to be&mdash;but&mdash;I left money for masters&mdash;and
      she pronounces French like a chambermaid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet she is fond of her book too. She's always reading, and good for
      nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reading! those trashy novels!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So like you,&mdash;you always come to scold, and make things unpleasant,"
      said Mrs. Leslie, peevishly. "You are grown too fine for us, and I am sure
      we suffer affronts enough from others, not to want a little respect from
      our own children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not mean to affront you," said Randal, sadly. "Pardon me. But who
      else has done so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Leslie went into a minute and most irritating catalogue of all
      the mortifications and insults she had received; the grievances of a petty
      provincial family, with much pretension and small power,&mdash;of all
      people, indeed, without the disposition to please&mdash;without the
      ability to serve&mdash;who exaggerate every offence, and are thankful for
      no kindness. Farmer Jones had insolently refused to send his wagon twenty
      miles for coals. Mr. Giles, the butcher, requesting the payment of his
      bill, had stated that the custom at Rood was too small for him to allow
      credit. Squire Thornhill, who was the present owner of the fairest slice
      of the old Leslie domains, had taken the liberty to ask permission to
      shoot over Mr. Leslie's land, since Mr. Leslie did not preserve. Lady
      Spratt (new people from the city, who hired a neighbouring country-seat)
      had taken a discharged servant of Mrs. Leslie's without applying for the
      character. The Lord-Lieutenant had given a ball, and had not invited the
      Leslies. Mr. Leslie's tenants had voted against their landlord's wish at
      the recent election. More than all, Squire Hazeldean and his Harry had
      called at Rood, and though Mrs. Leslie had screamed out to Jenny, "Not at
      home," she had been seen at the window, and the squire had actually forced
      his way in, and caught the whole family "in a state not fit to be seen."
      That was a trifle, but the squire had presumed to instruct Mr. Leslie how
      to manage his property, and Mrs. Hazeldean had actually told Juliet to
      hold up her head, and tie up her hair, "as if we were her cottagers!" said
      Mrs. Leslie, with the pride of a Montfydget.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these, and various other annoyances, though Randal was too sensible
      not to perceive their insignificance, still galled and mortified the
      listening heir of Rood. They showed, at least, even to the well-meant
      officiousness of the Hazeldeans, the small account in which the fallen
      family was held. As he sat still on the moss-grown pales, gloomy and
      taciturn, his mother standing beside him, with her cap awry, Mr. Leslie
      shamblingly sauntered up, and said in a pensive, dolorous whine,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish we had a good sum of money, Randal, boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To do Mr. Leslie justice, he seldom gave vent to any wish that savoured of
      avarice. His mind must be singularly aroused, to wander out of its normal
      limits of sluggish, dull content.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Randal looked at him in surprise, and said, "Do you, Sir?&mdash;why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The manors of Rood and Dulmansberry, and all the lands therein, which my
      great-grandfather sold away, are to be sold again when Squire Thornhill's
      eldest son comes of age, to cut off the entail. Sir John Spratt talks of
      buying them. I should like to have them back again! 'T is a shame to see
      the Leslie estates hawked about, and bought by Spratts and people. I wish
      I had a great, great sum of ready money." The poor gentleman extended his
      helpless fingers as he spoke, and fell into a dejected revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal sprang from the paling, a movement which frightened the
      contemplative pigs, and set them off squalling and scampering. "When does
      young Thornhill come of age?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was nineteen last August. I know it, because the day he was born I
      picked up my fossil of the sea-horse, just by Dulmansberry church, when
      the joy-bells were ringing. My fossil sea-horse! It will be an heirloom,
      Randal&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years&mdash;nearly two years&mdash;yet&mdash;ah, ah!" said Randal;
      and his sister now appearing, to announce that tea was ready, he threw his
      arm round her neck and kissed her. Juliet had arranged her hair and
      trimmed up her dress. She looked very pretty, and she had now the air of a
      gentlewoman,&mdash;something of Randal's own refinement in her slender
      proportions and well-shaped head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be patient, patient still, my dear sister," whispered Randal, "and keep
      your heart whole for two years longer." The young man was gay and
      good-humoured over his simple meal, while his family grouped round him.
      When it was over, Mr. Leslie lighted his pipe, and called for his
      brandy-and-water. Mrs. Leslie began to question about London and Court,
      and the new king and the new queen, and Mr. Audley Egerton, and hoped Mr.
      Egerton would leave Randal all his money, and that Randal would marry a
      rich woman, and that the king would make him a prime minister one of these
      days; and then she should like to see if Farmer Jones would refuse to send
      his wagon for coals! And every now and then, as the word "riches" or
      "money" caught Mr. Leslie's ears, he shook his head, drew his pipe from
      his mouth, "A Spratt should not have what belonged to my
      great-great-grandfather. If I had a good sum of ready money! the old
      family estates!" Oliver and Juliet sat silent, and on their good
      behaviour; and Randal, indulging his own reveries, dreamily heard the
      words "money," "Spratt," "great-great-grandfather," "rich wife," "family
      estates;" and they sounded to him vague and afar off, like whispers from
      the world of romance and legend,&mdash;weird prophecies of things to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the hearth which warmed the viper that nestled and gnawed at the
      heart of Randal, poisoning all the aspirations that youth should have
      rendered pure, ambition lofty, and knowledge beneficent and divine.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the rest of the household were in deep sleep, Randal stood long at
      his open window, looking over the dreary, comfortless scene,&mdash;the
      moon gleaming from skies half-autumnal, half-wintry, upon squalid decay,
      through the ragged fissures of the firs; and when he lay down to rest, his
      sleep was feverish, and troubled by turbulent dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he was up early, and with an unwonted colour in his cheeks, which
      his sister ascribed to the country air. After breakfast, he took his way
      towards Hazeldean, mounted upon a tolerable, horse, which he borrowed of a
      neighbouring farmer who occasionally hunted. Before noon, the garden and
      ter race of the Casino came in sight. He reined in his horse, and by the
      little fountain at which Leonard had been wont to eat his radishes and con
      his book, he saw Riccabocca seated under the shade of the red umbrella.
      And by the Italian's side stood a form that a Greek of old might have
      deemed the Naiad of the Fount; for in its youthful beauty there was
      something so full of poetry, something at once so sweet and so stately,
      that it spoke to the imagination while it charmed the sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal dismounted, tied his horse to the gate, and, walking down a
      trellised alley, came suddenly to the spot. His dark shadow fell over the
      clear mirror of the fountain just as Riccabocca had said, "All here is so
      secure from evil!&mdash;the waves of the fountain are never troubled like
      those of the river!" and Violante had answered in her soft native tongue,
      and lifting her dark, spiritual eyes, "But the fountain would be but a
      lifeless pool, oh my father, if the spray did not mount towards the
      skies!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      RANDAL advanced&mdash;"I fear, Signor Riccabocca, that I am guilty of some
      want of ceremony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To dispense with ceremony is the most delicate mode of conferring a
      compliment," replied the urbane Italian, as he recovered from his first
      surprise at Randal's sudden address, and extended his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante bowed her graceful head to the young man's respectful salutation.
      "I am on my way to Hazeldean," resumed Randal, "and, seeing you in the
      garden, could not resist this intrusion."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCOBOCCA.&mdash;"YOU come from London? Stirring times for you English,
      but I do not ask you the news. No news can affect us."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (softly).&mdash;"Perhaps yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA (startled).&mdash;"How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"Surely he speaks of Italy, and news from that country
      affects you still, my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"Nay, nay, nothing affects me like this country; its
      east winds might affect a pyramid! Draw your mantle round you, child, and
      go in; the air has suddenly grown chill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante smiled on her father, glanced uneasily towards Randal's grave
      brow, and went slowly towards the house. Riccabocca, after waiting some
      moments in silence, as if expecting Randal to speak, said, with affected
      carelessness,
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you think that you have news that might affect me? Corpo di Bacco! I
      am curious to learn what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may be mistaken&mdash;that depends on your answer to one question. Do
      you know the Count of Peschiera?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca winced, and turned pale. He could not baffle the watchful eye
      of the questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," said Randal; "I see that I am right. Believe in my sincerity. I
      speak but to warn and to serve you. The count seeks to discover the
      retreat of a countryman and kinsman of his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for what end?" cried Riccabocca, thrown off his guard, and his breast
      dilated, his crest rose, and his eye flashed; valour and defiance broke
      from habitual caution and self-control. "But&mdash;pooh!" he added,
      striving to regain his ordinary and half-ironical calm, "it matters not to
      me. I grant, sir, that I know the Count di Peschiera; but what has Dr.
      Riccabocca to do with the kinsman of so grand a personage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Riccabocca&mdash;nothing. But&mdash;" here Randal put his lip close
      to the Italian's ear, and whispered a brief sentence. Then retreating a
      step, but laying his hand on the exile's shoulder, he added, "Need I say
      that your secret is safe with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca made no answer. His eyes rested on the ground musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal continued, "And I shall esteem it the highest honour you can bestow
      on me, to be permitted to assist you in forestalling danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA (slowly).&mdash;"Sir, I thank you; you have my secret, and I
      feel assured it is safe, for I speak to an English gentleman. There may be
      family reasons why I should avoid the Count di Peschiera; and, indeed, he
      is safest from shoals who steers clearest of his relations."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Italian regained his caustic smile as he uttered that wise,
      villanous Italian maxim.
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"I know little of the Count of Peschiera save from the
      current talk of the world. He is said to hold the estates of a kinsman who
      took part in a conspiracy against the Austrian power."
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"It is true. Let that content him; what more does he
      desire? You spoke of forestalling danger; what danger? I am on the soil of
      England, and protected by its laws."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Allow me to inquire if, had the kinsman no child, the Count
      di Peschiera would be legitimate and natural heir to the estates he
      holds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA.&mdash;"He would&mdash;What then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Does that thought suggest no danger to the child of the
      kinsman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca recoiled, and gasped forth, "The child! You do not mean to
      imply that this man, infamous though he be, can contemplate the crime of
      an assassin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal paused perplexed. His ground was delicate. He knew not what causes
      of resentment the exile entertained against the count. He knew not whether
      Riccabocca would not assent to an alliance that might restore him to his
      country,&mdash;and he resolved to feel his way with precaution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not," said he, smiling gravely, "mean to insinuate so horrible a
      charge against a man whom I have never seen. He seeks you,&mdash;that is
      all I know. I imagine, from his general character, that in this search he
      consults his interest. Perhaps all matters might be conciliated by an
      interview!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An interview!" exclaimed Riccabocca; "there is but one way we should
      meet,&mdash;foot to foot, and hand to hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it so? Then you would not listen to the count if he proposed some
      amicable compromise,&mdash;if, for instance, he was a candidate for the
      hand of your daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Italian, so wise and so subtle in his talk, was as rash and blind
      when it came to action as if he had been born in Ireland and nourished on
      potatoes and Repeal. He bared his whole soul to the merciless eye of
      Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter!" he exclaimed. "Sir, your very question is an insult."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's way became clear at once. "Forgive me," he said mildly; "I will
      tell you frankly all that I know. I am acquainted with the count's sister.
      I have some little influence over her. It was she who informed me that the
      count had come here, bent upon discovering your refuge, and resolved to
      wed your daughter. This is the danger of which I spoke. And when I asked
      your permission to aid in forestalling it, I only intended to suggest that
      it might be wise to find some securer home, and that I, if permitted to
      know that home, and to visit you, could apprise you from time to time of
      the count's plans and movements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I thank you sincerely," said Riccabocca, with emotion; "but am I not
      safe here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt it. Many people have visited the squire in the shooting season,
      who will have heard of you,&mdash;perhaps seen you, and who are likely to
      meet the count in London. And Frank Hazeldean, too, who knows the count's
      sister&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, true" interrupted Riccabocca. "I see, I see. I will consider, I
      will reflect. Meanwhile you are going to Hazel dean. Do not say a word to
      the squire. He knows not the secret you have discovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words Riccabocca turned slightly away, and Randal took the hint
      to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all times command and rely on me," said the young traitor, and he
      regained the pale to which he had fastened his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he remounted, he cast his eyes towards the place where he had left
      Riccabocca. The Italian was still standing there. Presently the form of
      Jackeymo was seen emerging from the shrubs. Riccabocca turned hastily
      round, recognized his servant, uttered an exclamation loud enough to reach
      Randal's ear, and then, catching Jackeymo by the arm, disappeared with him
      amidst the deep recesses of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be indeed in my favour," thought Randal, as he rode on, "if I can
      get them into the neighbourhood of London,&mdash;all occasion there to
      woo, and if expedient, to win, the heiress."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Br the Lord, Harry!" cried the squire, as he stood with his wife in the
      park, on a visit of inspection to some first-rate Southdowns just added to
      his stock,&mdash;"by the Lord, if that is not Randal Leslie trying to get
      into the park at the back gate! Hollo, Randal! you must come round by the
      lodge, my boy," said he. "You see this gate is locked to keep out
      trespassers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pity," said Randal. "I like short cuts, and you have shut up a very
      short one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the trespassers said," quoth the squire; "but Stirn insisted on it&mdash;valuable
      man, Stirn. But ride round to the lodge. Put up your horse, and you'll
      join us before we can get to the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal nodded and smiled, and rode briskly on. The squire rejoined his
      Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, William," said she, anxiously, "though certainly Randal Leslie means
      well, I always dread his visits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I, in one sense," quoth the squire, "for he always carries away a
      bank-note for Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope he is really Frank's friend," said Mrs. Hazeldean. "Who's else can
      he be? Not his own, poor fellow, for he will never accept a shilling from
      me, though his grandmother was as good a Hazeldean as I am. But, zounds, I
      like his pride, and his economy too. As for Frank&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, William!" cried Mrs. Hazeldean, and put her fair hand before the
      squire's mouth. The squire was softened, and kissed the fair hand
      gallantly,&mdash;perhaps he kissed the lips too; at all events, the worthy
      pair were walking lovingly arm-in-arm when Randal joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not affect to perceive a certain coldness in the manner of Mrs.
      Hazeldean, but began immediately to talk to her about Frank; praise that
      young gentleman's appearance; expatiate on his health, his popularity, and
      his good gifts, personal and mental,&mdash;and this with so much warmth,
      that any dim and undeveloped suspicions Mrs. Hazeldean might have formed
      soon melted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal continued to make himself thus agreeable, until the squire,
      persuaded that his young kinsman was a first-rate agriculturalist,
      insisted upon carrying him off to the home-farm; and Harry turned towards
      the house; to order Randal's room to be got ready: "For," said Randal,
      "knowing that you will excuse my morning dress, I venture to invite myself
      to dine and sleep at the Hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      On approaching the farm-buildings, Randal was seized with the terror of an
      impostor; for, despite all the theoretical learning on Bucolics and
      Georgics with which he had dazzled the squire, poor Frank, so despised,
      would have beat him hollow when it came to the judging of the points of an
      ox, or the show of a crop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha," cried the squire, chuckling, "I long to see how you'll astonish
      Stirn. Why, you'll guess in a moment where we put the top-dressing; and
      when you come to handle my short-horns, I dare swear you'll know to a
      pound how much oil-cake has gone into their sides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you do me too much honour,&mdash;indeed you do. I only know the
      general principles of agriculture; the details are eminently interesting,
      but I have not had the opportunity to acquire them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff!" cried the squire. "How can a man know general principles unless
      he has first studied the details? You are too modest, my boy. Ho! there 's
      Stirn looking out for us!" Randal saw the grim visage of Stirn peering out
      of a cattleshed, and felt undone. He made a desperate rush towards
      changing the squire's humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, perhaps Frank may soon gratify your wish, and turn farmer
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh!" quoth the squire, stopping short,&mdash;"what now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose he were to marry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd give him the two best farms on the property rent free. Ha, ha! Has he
      seen the girl yet? I'd leave him free to choose; sir, I chose for myself,&mdash;every
      man should. Not but what Miss Stick-to-rights is an heiress, and, I hear,
      a very decent girl, and that would join the two properties, and put an end
      to that law-suit about the right of way, which began in the reign of King
      Charles the Second, and is likely otherwise to last till the day of
      judgment. But never mind her; let Frank choose to please himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not fail to tell him so, sir. I did fear you might have some
      prejudices. But here we are at the farmyard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Burn the farmyard! How can I think of farmyards when you talk of Frank's
      marriage? Come on&mdash;this way. What were you saying about prejudices?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you might wish him to marry an Englishwoman, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "English! Good heavens, sir, does he mean to marry a Hindoo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I don't know that he means to marry at all; I am only surmising; but
      if he did fall in love with a foreigner&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A foreigner! Ah, then Harry was&mdash;" The squire stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who might, perhaps," observed Randal&mdash;not truly, if he referred to
      Madame di Negra&mdash;"who might, perhaps, speak very little English?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord ha' mercy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a Roman Catholic&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worshipping idols, and roasting people who don't worship them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signor Riccabocca is not so bad as that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rickeybockey! Well, if it was his daughter! But not speak English! and
      not go to the parish church! By George, if Frank thought of such a thing,
      I'd cut him off with a shilling. Don't talk to me, sir; I would. I 'm a
      mild man, and an easy man; but when I say a thing, I say it, Mr. Leslie.
      Oh, but it is a jest,&mdash;you are laughing at me. There 's no such
      painted good-for-nothing creature in Frank's eye, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir, if ever I find there is, I will give you notice in time. At
      present, I was only trying to ascertain what you wished for a
      daughter-in-law. You said you had no prejudice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more I have,&mdash;not a bit of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't like a foreigner and a Catholic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who the devil would?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if she had rank and title?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rank and title! Bubble and squeak! No, not half so good as bubble and
      squeak. English beef and good cabbage. But foreign rank and title!&mdash;foreign
      cabbage and beef!&mdash;foreign bubble and foreign squeak!" And the squire
      made a wry face, and spat forth his disgust and indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have an Englishwoman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't care, provided she is a tidy, sensible, active lass, with a good
      character for her dower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Character&mdash;ah, that is indispensable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so, indeed. A Mrs. Hazeldean of Hazeldean&mdash;You
      frighten me. He's not going to run off with a divorced woman, or a&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire stopped, and looked so red in the face that Randal feared he
      might be seized with apoplexy before Frank's crimes had made him alter his
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore he hastened to relieve Mr. Hazeldean's mind, and assured him
      that he had been only talking at random; that Frank was in the habit,
      indeed, of seeing foreign ladies occasionally, as all persons in the
      London world were; but that he was sure Frank would never marry without
      the full consent and approval of his parents. He ended by repeating his
      assurance, that he would warn the squire if ever it became necessary.
      Still, however, he left Mr. Hazeldean so disturbed and uneasy that that
      gentleman forgot all about the farm, and went moodily on in the opposite
      direction, reentering the park at its farther extremity. As soon as they
      approached the house, the squire hastened to shut himself with his wife in
      full parental consultation; and Randal, seated upon a bench on the
      terrace, revolved the mischief he had done, and its chances of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus seated, and thus thinking, a footstep approached cautiously,
      and a low voice said, in broken English, "Sare, sare, let me speak vid
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal turned in surprise, and beheld a swarthy, saturnine face, with
      grizzled hair and marked features. He recognized the figure that had
      joined Riccabocca in the Italian's garden. "Speak-a-you Italian?" resumed
      Jackeymo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal, who had made himself an excellent linguist, nodded assent; and
      Jackeymo, rejoiced, begged him to withdraw into a more private part of the
      grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal obeyed, and the two gained the shade of a stately chestnut avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," then said Jackeymo, speaking in his native tongue, and expressing
      himself with a certain simple pathos, "I am but a poor man; my name is
      Giacomo. You have heard of me; servant to the signore whom you saw to-day,&mdash;only
      a servant; but he honours me with his confidence. We have known danger
      together; and of all his friends and followers, I alone came with him to
      the stranger's land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, faithful fellow," said Randal, examining the man's face, "say on.
      Your master confides in you? He has confided that which I told him this
      day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did. Ah, sir; the padrone was too proud to ask you to explain more,&mdash;too
      proud to show fear of another. But he does fear, he ought to fear, he
      shall fear," continued Jackeymo, working himself up to passion,&mdash;"for
      the padrone has a daughter, and his enemy is a villain. Oh, sir, tell me
      all that you did not tell to the padrone. You hinted that this man might
      wish to marry the signora. Marry her!&mdash;I could cut his throat at the
      altar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," said Randal, "I believe that such is his object."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why? He is rich, she is penniless,&mdash;no, not quite that, for we
      have saved&mdash;but penniless, compared to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good friend, I know not yet his motives; but I can easily learn them.
      If, however, this count be your master's enemy, it is surely well to guard
      against him, whatever his designs; and to do so, you should move into
      London or its neighbourhood. I fear that, while we speak, the count may
      get upon his track."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had better not come here!" cried the servant, menacingly, and putting
      his hand where the knife was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beware of your own anger, Giacomo. One act of violence, and you would be
      transported from England, and your mast'r would lose a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo seemed struck by this caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if the padrone were to meet him, do you think the padrone would
      meekly say, 'Come sta sa Signoria'? The padrone would strike him dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! hush! You speak of what in England is called murder, and is
      punished by the gallows. If you really love your master, for Heaven's sake
      get him from this place, get him from all chance of such passion and
      peril. I go to town to-morrow; I will find him a house, that shall be safe
      from all spies, all discovery. And there, too, my friend. I can do what I
      cannot at this distance,&mdash;watch over him, and keep watch also on his
      enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo seized Randal's hand, and lifted it towards his lip; then, as if
      struck by a sudden suspicion, dropped the hand, and said bluntly,
      "Signore, I think you have seen the padrone twice. Why do you take this
      interest in him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it so uncommon to take interest even in a stranger who is menaced by
      some peril?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo, who believed little in general philanthropy, shook his head
      sceptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," continued Randal, suddenly bethinking himself of a more
      plausible reason,&mdash;"besides, I am a friend and connection of Mr.
      Egerton; and Mr. Egerton's most intimate friend is Lord L'Estrange; and I
      have heard that Lord L'Estrange&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The good lord! Oh, now I understand," interrupted Jackeymo, and his brow
      cleared. "Ah, if he were in England! But you will let us know when he
      comes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Now, tell me, Giacomo, is this count really unprincipled and
      dangerous? Remember I know him not personally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has neither heart nor conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That defect makes him dangerous to men; perhaps not less so to women.
      Could it be possible, if he obtained any interview with the signora, that
      he could win her affections?" Jackeymo crossed himself rapidly and made no
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard that he is still very handsome." Jackeymo groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal resumed, "Enough; persuade the padrone to come to town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if the count is in town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That makes no difference; the safest place is always the largest city.
      Everywhere else, a foreigner is in himself an object of attention and
      curiosity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let your master, then, come to London, or rather, into its neighbourhood.
      He can reside in one of the suburbs most remote from the count's haunts.
      In two days I will have found him a lodging and write to him. You trust to
      me now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do indeed,&mdash;I do, Excellency. Ah, if the signorina were married,
      we would not care!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married! But she looks so high!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! not now! not here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal sighed heavily. Jackeymo's eyes sparkled. He thought he had
      detected a new motive for Randal's interest,&mdash;a motive to an Italian
      the most natural, the most laudable of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find the house, Signore, write to the padrone. He shall come. I'll talk
      to him. I can manage him. Holy San Giacomo, bestir thyself now,&mdash;'t
      is long since I troubled thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo strode off through the fading trees, smiling and muttering as he
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first dinner-bell rang, and on entering the drawingroom, Randal found
      Parson Dale and his wife, who had been invited in haste to meet the
      unexpected visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preliminary greetings over, Mr. Dale took the opportunity afforded by
      the squire's absence to inquire after the health of Mr. Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is always well," said Randal. "I believe he is made of iron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His heart is of gold," said the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Randal, inquisitively, "you told me you had come in contact
      with him once, respecting, I think, some of your old parishioners at
      Lansmere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson nodded, and there was a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember your battle by the stocks, Mr. Leslie?" said Mr. Dale,
      with a good-humoured laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, yes. By the way, now you speak of it, I met my old opponent in
      London the first year I went up to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did! where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a literary scamp's,&mdash;a cleverish man called Burley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Burley! I have seen some burlesque verses in Greek by a Mr. Burley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt the same person. He has disappeared,&mdash;gone to the dogs, I
      dare say. Burlesque Greek is not a knowledge very much in power at
      present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but Leonard Fairfield&mdash;you have seen him since?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor heard of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange to say, not for a long time. But I have reason to believe that he
      must be doing well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You surprise me! Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because two years ago he sent for his mother. She went to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is enough; for he would not have sent for her if he could not maintain
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the Hazeldeans entered, arm-in-arm, and the fat butler announced
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire was unusually taciturn, Mrs. Hazeldean thoughtful, Mrs. Dale
      languid and headachy. The parson, who seldom enjoyed the luxury of
      converse with a scholar, save when he quarrelled with Dr. Riccaboeca, was
      animated by Randal's repute for ability into a great desire for argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A glass of wine, Mr. Leslie. You were saying, before dinner, that
      burlesque Greek is not a knowledge very much in power at present. Pray,
      Sir, what knowledge is in power?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (laconically).&mdash;"Practical knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"What of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Men."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (candidly).&mdash;"Well, I suppose that is the most available sort
      of knowledge, in a worldly point of view. How does one learn it? Do books
      help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"According as they are read, they help or injure."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"How should they be read in order to help?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Read specially to apply to purposes that lead to power."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (very much struck with Randal's pithy and Spartan logic).&mdash;"Upon
      my word, Sir, you express yourself very well. I must own that I began
      these questions in the hope of differing from you; for I like an
      argument."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he does," growled the squire; "the most contradictory creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Argument is the salt of talk. But now I am afraid I must
      agree with you, which I was not at all prepared for."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal bowed and answered, "No two men of our education can dispute upon
      the application of knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (pricking up his ears).&mdash;"Eh?&mdash;what to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Power, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (overjoyed).&mdash;"Power!&mdash;the vulgarest application of it,
      or the loftiest? But you mean the loftiest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (in his turn interested and interrogative).&mdash;"What do you call
      the loftiest, and what the vulgarest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"The vulgarest, self-interest; the loftiest, beneficence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal suppressed the half-disdainful smile that rose to his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak, Sir, as a clergyman should do. I admire your sentiment, and
      adopt it; but I fear that the knowledge which aims only at beneficence
      very rarely in this world gets any power at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (seriously).&mdash;"That's true; I never get my own way when I want
      to do a kindness, and Stirn always gets his when he insists on something
      diabolically brutal and harsh."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Pray, Mr. Leslie, what does intellectual power refined to
      the utmost, but entirely stripped of beneficence, most resemble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Resemble?&mdash;I can hardly say. Some very great man&mdash;almost
      any very great man&mdash;who has baffled all his foes, and attained all
      his ends."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"I doubt if any man has ever become very great who has not
      meant to be beneficent, though he might err in the means. Caesar was
      naturally beneficent, and so was Alexander. But intellectual power refined
      to the utmost, and wholly void of beneficence, resembles only one being,
      and that, sir, is the Principle of Evil."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (startled).&mdash;"Do you mean the Devil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Yes, Sir, the Devil; and even he, Sir, did not succeed!
      Even he, Sir, is what your great men would call a most decided failure."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"My dear, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Our religion proves it, my love; he was an angel, and he
      fell."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a solemn pause. Randal was more impressed than he liked to own
      to himself. By this time the dinner was over, and the servants had
      retired. Harry glanced at Carry. Carry smoothed her gown and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen remained over their wine; and the parson, satisfied with
      what he deemed a clencher upon his favourite subject of discussion,
      changed the subject to lighter topics, till, happening to fall upon
      tithes, the squire struck in, and by dint of loudness of voice, and
      truculence of brow, fairly overwhelmed both his guests, and proved to his
      own satisfaction that tithes were an unjust and unchristianlike usurpation
      on the part of the Church generally, and a most especial and iniquitous
      infliction upon the Hazeldean estates in particular.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On entering the drawing-room, Randal found the two ladies seated close
      together, in a position much more appropriate to the familiarity of their
      school-days than to the politeness of the friendship now existing between
      them. Mrs. Hazeldean's hand hung affectionately over Carry's shoulder, and
      both those fair English faces were bent over the same book. It was pretty
      to see these sober matrons, so different from each other in character and
      aspect, thus unconsciously restored to the intimacy of happy maiden youth
      by the golden link of some Magician from the still land of Truth or Fancy,
      brought together in heart, as each eye rested on the same thought; closer
      and closer, as sympathy, lost in the actual world, grew out of that world
      which unites in one bond of feeling the readers of some gentle book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what work interests you so much?" asked Randal, pausing by the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One you have read, of course," replied Mrs. Dale, putting a book-mark
      embroidered by herself into the page, and handing the volume to Randal.
      "It has made a great sensation, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal glanced at the title of the work. "True," said he, "I have heard
      much of it in London, but I have not yet had time to read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"I can lend it to you, if you like to look over it
      to-night, and you can leave it for me with Mrs. Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (approaching).&mdash;"Oh, that book!&mdash;yes, you must read it. I
      do not know a work more instructive."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Instructive! Certainly I will read it then. But I thought
      it was a mere work of amusement,&mdash;of fancy. It seems so as I look
      over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"So is the 'Vicar of Wakefield;' yet what book more
      instructive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"I should not have said that of the 'Vicar of Wakefield.' A
      pretty book enough, though the story is most improbable. But how is it
      instructive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"By its results: it leaves us happier and better. What can
      any instruction do more? Some works instruct through the head, some
      through the heart. The last reach the widest circle, and often produce the
      most genial influence on the character. This book belongs to the last. You
      will grant my proposition when you have read it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal smiled and took the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"Is the author known yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"I have heard it ascribed to many writers, but I believe no
      one has claimed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"I think it must have been written by my old college friend,
      Professor Moss, the naturalist,&mdash;its descriptions of scenery are so
      accurate."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"La, Charles dear! that snuffy, tiresome, prosy
      professor? How can you talk such nonsense? I am sure the author must be
      young, there is so much freshness of feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN (positively).&mdash;"Yes, certainly, young."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (no less positively).&mdash;"I should say just the contrary. Its
      tone is too serene, and its style too simple, for a young man. Besides, I
      don't know any young man who would send me his book, and this book has
      been sent me, very handsomely bound, too, you see. Depend upon it Moss is
      the loan&mdash;quite his turn of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"You are too provoking, Charles dear! Mr. Moss is so
      remarkably plain, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Must an author be handsome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Ha! ha! Answer that if you can, Carry." Carry remained mute
      and disdainful.
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (with great naivete).&mdash;"Well, I don't think there's much in
      the book, whoever wrote it; for I've read it myself, and understand every
      word of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE.&mdash;"I don't see why you should suppose it was written by a
      man at all. For my part, I think it must be a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"Yes, there's a passage about maternal affection,
      which only a woman could have written."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Pooh! pooh! I should like to see a woman who could have
      written that description of an August evening before a thunderstorm; every
      wild-flower in the hedgerow exactly the flowers of August, every sign in
      the air exactly those of the month. Bless you! a woman would have filled
      the hedge with violets and cowslips. Nobody else but my friend Moss could
      have written that description."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"I don't know; there's a simile about the waste of corn-seed
      in hand-sowing, which makes me think he must be a farmer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. DALE (scornfully).&mdash;"A farmer! In hobnailed shoes, I suppose! I
      say it is a woman."

    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"A WOMAN, and A MOTHER!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"A middle-aged man, and a naturalist."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"No, no, Parson, certainly a young man; for that love-scene
      puts me in mind of my own young days, when I would have given my ears to
      tell Harry how handsome I thought her; and all I could say was, 'Fine
      weather for the crops, Miss.' Yes, a young man and a farmer. I should not
      wonder if he had held the plough himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (who had been turning over the pages).&mdash;"This sketch of Night
      in London comes from a man who has lived the life of cities and looked at
      wealth with the eyes of poverty. Not bad! I will read the book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange," said the parson, smiling, "that this little work should so have
      entered into our minds, suggested to all of us different ideas, yet
      equally charmed all,&mdash;given a new and fresh current to our dull
      country life, animated us as with the sight of a world in our breasts we
      had never seen before save in dreams: a little work like this by a man we
      don't know and never may! Well, that knowledge is power, and a noble one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sort of power, certainly, sir," said Randal, candidly; and that night,
      when Randal retired to his own room, he suspended his schemes and
      projects, and read, as he rarely did, without an object to gain by the
      reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work surprised him by the pleasure it gave. Its charm lay in the
      writer's calm enjoyment of the beautiful. It seemed like some happy soul
      sunning itself in the light of its own thoughts. Its power was so tranquil
      and even, that it was only a critic who could perceive how much force and
      vigour were necessary to sustain the wing that floated aloft with so
      imperceptible an effort. There was no one faculty predominating
      tyrannically over the others; all seemed proportioned in the felicitous
      symmetry of a nature rounded, integral, and complete. And when the work
      was closed, it left behind it a tender warmth that played round the heart
      of the reader and vivified feelings which seemed unknown before. Randal
      laid down the book softly; and for five minutes the ignoble and base
      purposes to which his own knowledge was applied stood before him, naked
      and unmasked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut!" said he, wrenching himself violently away from the benign
      influence, "it was not to sympathize with Hector, but to conquer with
      Achilles, that Alexander of Macedon kept Homer under his pillow. Such
      should be the true use of books to him who has the practical world to
      subdue; let parsons and women construe it otherwise, as they may!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Principle of Evil descended again upon the intellect from which
      the guide of Beneficence was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal rose at the sound of the first breakfast-bell, and on the staircase
      met Mrs. Haaeldean. He gave her back the book; and as he was about to
      speak, she beckoned to him to follow her into a little morning-room
      appropriated to herself,&mdash;no boudoir of white and gold, with pictures
      by Watteau, but lined with large walnut-tree presses, that held the old
      heirloom linen, strewed with lavender, stores for the housekeeper, and
      medicines for the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seating herself on a large chair in this sanctum, Mrs. Hazeldean looked
      formidably at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," said the lady, coming at once to the point, with her usual
      straightforward candour, "what is all this you have been saying to my
      husband as to the possibility of Frank's marrying a foreigner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Would you be as averse to such a notion as Mr. Hazeldean
      is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"You ask me a question, instead of answering mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal was greatly put out in his fence by these rude thrusts. For indeed
      he had a double purpose to serve,&mdash;first, thoroughly to know if
      Frank's marriage with a woman like Madame di Negra would irritate the
      squire sufficiently to endanger the son's inheritance; and, secondly, to
      prevent Mr. and Mrs. Hazeldean believing seriously that such a marriage
      was to be apprehended, lest they should prematurely address Frank on the
      subject, and frustrate the marriage itself. Yet, withal, he must so
      express himself, that he could not be afterwards accused by the parents of
      disguising matters. In his talk to the squire the preceding day, he had
      gone a little too far,&mdash;further than he would have done but for his
      desire of escaping the cattle-shed and short-horns. While he mused, Mrs.
      Hazeldean observed him with her honest sensible eyes, and finally
      exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out with it, Mr. Leslie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out with what, my dear madam? The squire has sadly exaggerated the
      importance of what was said mainly in jest. But I will own to you plainly,
      that Frank has appeared to me a little smitten with a certain fair
      Italian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Italian!" cried Mrs. Hazeldean. "Well, I said so from the first. Italian!&mdash;that's
      all, is it?" and she smiled. Randal was more and more perplexed. The pupil
      of his eye contracted, as it does when we retreat into ourselves, and
      think, watch, and keep guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And perhaps," resumed Mrs. Hazeldean, with a very sunny expression of
      countenance, "you have noticed this in Frank since he was here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," murmured Randal; "but I think his heart or his fancy was
      touched even before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very natural," said Mrs. Hazeldean; "how could he help it?&mdash;such a
      beautiful creature! Well, I must not ask you to tell Frank's secrets; but
      I guess the object of attraction; and though she will have no fortune to
      speak of, and it is not such a match as he might form, still she is so
      amiable, and has been so well brought up, and is so little like one's
      general notions of a Roman Catholic, that I think I could persuade
      Hazeldean into giving his consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Randal, drawing a long breath, and beginning, with his
      practised acuteness, to detect Mrs. Ilazeldean's error, "I am very much
      relieved and rejoiced to hear this; and I may venture to give Frank some
      hope, if I find him disheartened and desponding, poor fellow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you may," replied Mrs. Hazeldean, laughing pleasantly. "But you
      should not have frightened poor William so, hinting that the lady knew
      very little English. She has an accent, to be sure; but she speaks our
      tongue very prettily. I always forget that she 's not English born! Ha,
      ha, poor William!"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Ha, ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"We had once thought of another match for Frank,&mdash;a
      girl of good English family."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Miss Sticktorights?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"No; that's an old whim of Hazeldean's. But I doubt
      if the Sticktorights would ever merge their property in ours. Bless you!
      it would be all off the moment they came to settlements, and had to give
      up the right of way. We thought of a very different match; but there's no
      dictating to young hearts, Mr. Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Indeed no, Mrs. Hazeldean. But since we now understand each
      other so well, excuse me if I suggest that you had better leave things to
      themselves, and not write to Frank on the subject. Young hearts, you know,
      are often stimulated by apparent difficulties, and grow cool when the
      obstacle vanishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HAZELDEAN.&mdash;"Very possibly; it was not so with Hazeldean and me.
      But I shall not write to Frank on the subject for a different reason&mdash;though
      I would consent to the match, and so would William; yet we both would
      rather, after all, that Frank married an Englishwoman, and a Protestant.
      We will not, therefore, do anything to encourage the idea. But if Frank's
      happiness becomes really at stake, then we will step in. In short, we
      would neither encourage nor oppose. You understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in the mean while, it is quite right that Frank should see the world,
      and try to distract his mind, or at least to know it. And I dare say it
      has been some thought of that kind which has prevented his coming here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal, dreading a further and plainer eclaircissement, now rose, and
      saying, "Pardon me, but I must hurry over breakfast, and be back in time
      to catch the coach"&mdash;offered his arm to his hostess, and led her into
      the breakfast-parlour. Devouring his meal, as if in great haste, he then
      mounted his horse, and, taking cordial leave of his entertainers, trotted
      briskly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things favoured his project,&mdash;even chance had befriended him in
      Mrs. Hazeldean's mistake. She had, not unnaturally, supposed Violante to
      have captivated Frank on his last visit to the Hall. Thus, while Randal
      had certified his own mind that nothing could more exasperate the squire
      than an alliance with Madame di Negra, he could yet assure Frank that Mrs.
      Hazeldean was all on his side. And when the error was discovered, Mrs.
      Hazeldean would only have to blame herself for it. Still more successful
      had his diplomacy proved with the Riccaboccas: he had ascertained the
      secret he had come to discover; he should induce the Italian to remove to
      the neighbourhood of London; and if Violante were the great heiress he
      suspected her to prove, whom else of her own age would she see but him?
      And the old Leslie domains to be sold in two years&mdash;a portion of the
      dowry might purchase them! Flushed by the triumph of his craft, all former
      vacillations of conscience ceased. In high and fervent spirits he passed
      the Casino, the garden of which was solitary and deserted, reached his
      home, and, telling Oliver to be studious, and Juliet to be patient, walked
      thence to meet the coach and regain the capital.

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Violante was seated in her own little room, and looking from the window on
      the terrace that stretched below. The day was warm for the time of year.
      The orange-trees had been removed under shelter for the approach of
      winter; but where they had stood sat Mrs. Riccabocca at work. In the
      belvidere, Riccabocca himself was conversing with his favourite servant.
      But the casements and the door of the belvidere were open; and where they
      sat, both wife and daughter could see the padrone leaning against the
      wall, with his arms folded and his eyes fixed on the floor; while
      Jackeymo, with one finger on his master's arm, was talking to him with
      visible earnestness. And the daughter from the window and the wife from
      her work directed tender, anxious eyes towards the still, thoughtful form
      so dear to both. For the last day or two, Riccabocca had been peculiarly
      abstracted, even to gloom. Each felt there was something stirring at his
      heart,&mdash;neither, as yet, knew what.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante's room silently revealed the nature of the education by which her
      character had been formed. Save a sketchbook, which lay open on a desk at
      hand, and which showed talent exquisitely taught (for in this Riccabocca
      had been her teacher), there was nothing that spoke of the ordinary female
      accomplishments. No piano stood open, no harp occupied yon nook, which
      seemed made for one; no broidery-frame, nor implements of work, betrayed
      the usual and graceful resources of a girl; but ranged on shelves against
      the wall were the best writers in English, Italian, and French; and these
      betokened an extent of reading, that he who wishes for a companion to his
      mind in the sweet commune of woman, which softens and refines all it gives
      and takes in interchange, will never condemn as masculine. You had but to
      look into Violante's face to see how noble was the intelligence that
      brought soul to those lovely features. Nothing hard, nothing dry and stern
      was there. Even as you detected knowledge, it was lost in the gentleness
      of grace. In fact, whatever she gained in the graver kinds of information
      became transmuted, through her heart and her fancy, into spiritual, golden
      stores. Give her some tedious and arid history, her imagination seized
      upon beauties other readers had passed by, and, like the eye of the
      artist, detected everywhere the Picturesque. Something in her mind seemed
      to reject all that was mean and commonplace, and to bring out all that was
      rare and elevated in whatever it received. Living so apart from all
      companions of her age, she scarcely belonged to the present time. She
      dwelt in the Past, as Sabrina in her crystal well. Images of chivalry, of
      the Beautiful and the Heroic,&mdash;such as, in reading the silvery line
      of Tasso, rise before us, softening force and valour into love and song,&mdash;haunted
      the reveries of the fair Italian maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell us not that the Past, examined by cold Philosophy, was no better and
      no loftier than the Present: it is not thus seen by pure and generous
      eyes. Let the Past perish, when it ceases to reflect on its magic mirror
      the beautiful Romance which is its noblest reality, though perchance but
      the shadow of Delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Violante was not merely the dreamer. In her, life was so puissant and
      rich, that action seemed necessary to its glorious development,&mdash;action,
      but still in the woman's sphere,&mdash;action to bless and to refine and
      to exalt all around her, and to pour whatever else of ambition was left
      unsatisfied into sympathy with the aspirations of man. Despite her
      father's fears of the bleak air of England, in that air she had
      strengthened the delicate health of her childhood. Her elastic step, her
      eyes full of sweetness and light, her bloom, at once soft and luxuriant,&mdash;all
      spoke of the vital powers fit to sustain a mind of such exquisite mould,
      and the emotions of a heart that, once aroused, could ennoble the passions
      of the South with the purity and devotion of the North. Solitude makes
      some natures more timid, some more bold. Violante was fearless. When she
      spoke, her eyes frankly met your own; and she was so ignorant of evil,
      that as yet she seemed nearly unacquainted with shame. From this courage,
      combined with affluence of idea, came a delightful flow of happy converse.
      Though possessing so imperfectly the accomplishments ordinarily taught to
      young women, and which may be cultured to the utmost, and yet leave the
      thoughts so barren, and the talk so vapid, she had that accomplishment
      which most pleases the taste, and commands the love, of the man of talent;
      especially if his talent be not so actively employed as to make him desire
      only relaxation where he seeks companionship,&mdash;the accomplishment of
      facility in intellectual interchange, the charm that clothes in musical
      words beautiful womanly ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear him sigh at this distance," said Violante, softly, as she still
      watched her father; "and methinks this is a new grief, and not for his
      country. He spoke twice yesterday of that dear English friend, and wished
      that he were here."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she said this, unconsciously the virgin blushed, her hands drooped on
      her knee, and she fell herself into thought as profound as her father's,
      but less gloomy. From her arrival in England, Violante had been taught a
      grateful interest in the name of Harley L'Estrange. Her father, preserving
      a silence that seemed disdain of all his old Italian intimates, had been
      pleased to converse with open heart of the Englishman who had saved where
      countrymen had betrayed. He spoke of the soldier, then in the full bloom
      of youth, who, unconsoled by fame, had nursed the memory of some hidden
      sorrow amidst the pine-trees that cast their shadow over the sunny Italian
      lake; how Riccabocca, then honoured and happy, had courted from his
      seclusion the English signore, then the mourner and the voluntary exile;
      how they had grown friends amidst the landscapes in which her eyes had
      opened to the day; how Harley had vainly warned him from the rash schemes
      in which he had sought to reconstruct in an hour the ruins of weary ages;
      how, when abandoned, deserted, proscribed, pursued, he had fled for life,
      the infant Violante clasped to his bosom, the English soldier had given
      him refuge, baffled the pursuers, armed his servants, accompanied the
      fugitive at night towards the defile in the Apennines, and, when the
      emissaries of a perfidious enemy, hot in the chase, came near, had said,
      "You have your child to save! Fly on! Another league, and you are beyond
      the borders. We will delay the foes with parley; they will not harm us."
      And not till escape was gained did the father know that the English friend
      had delayed the foe, not by parley, but by the sword, holding the pass
      against numbers, with a breast as dauntless as Bayard's on the glorious
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since then, the same Englishman had never ceased to vindicate his
      name, to urge his cause; and if hope yet remained of restoration to land
      and honours, it was in that untiring zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, naturally and insensibly, this secluded and musing girl had
      associated all that she read in tales of romance and chivalry with the
      image of the brave and loyal stranger. He it was who animated her drearhs
      of the Past, and seemed born to be, in the destined hour, the deliverer of
      the Future. Around this image grouped all the charms that the fancy of
      virgin woman can raise from the enchanted lore of old Heroic Fable. Once
      in her early girlhood, her father (to satisfy her curiosity, eager for
      general description) had drawn from memory a sketch of the features of the
      Englishman,&mdash;drawn Harley, as he was in that first youth, flattered
      and idealized, no doubt, by art, and by partial gratitude, but still
      resembling him as he was then, while the deep mournfulness of recent
      sorrow yet shadowed and concentrated all the varying expressions of his
      countenance; and to look on him was to say, "So sad, yet so young!" Never
      did Violante pause to remember that the same years which ripened herself
      from infancy into woman were passing less gently over that smooth cheek
      and dreamy brow,&mdash;that the world might be altering the nature as time
      the aspect. To her the hero of the Ideal remained immortal in bloom and
      youth. Bright illusion, common to us all, where Poetry once hallows the
      human form! Who ever thinks of Petrarch as the old, timeworn man? 'Who
      does not see him as when he first gazed on Laura?&mdash;

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And Violante, thus absorbed in revery, forgot to keep watch on the
      belvidere. And the belvidere was now deserted. The wife, who had no other
      ideal to distract her thoughts, saw Riccabocca pass into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exile entered his daughter's room, and she started to feel his hand
      upon her locks and his kiss upon her brow. "My child!" cried Riccabocca,
      seating himself, "I have resolved to leave for a time this retreat, and to
      seek the neighbourhood of London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, dear father, that, then, was your thought? But what can be your
      reason? Do not turn away; you know how care fully I have obeyed your
      command and kept your secret. Ah, you will confide in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, indeed," returned Riccabocca, with emotion. "I leave this place in
      the fear lest my enemies discover me. I shall say to others that you are
      of an age to require teachers not to be obtained here, but I should like
      none to know where we go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian said these last words through his teeth, and hanging his head.
      He said them in shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother&mdash;[so Violante always called Jemima]&mdash;my mother&mdash;you
      have spoken to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet. THERE is the difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No difficulty, for she loves you so well," replied Violante, with soft
      reproach. "Ah, why not also confide in her? Who so true, so good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good&mdash;I grant it!" exclaimed Riccabocca. "What then? <i>'Da cattiva
      Donna guardati, ed alla buona non fidar niente.'</i>&mdash;[From the bad
      woman, guard thyself; to the good woman trust nothing.]&mdash;And if you
      must trust," added the abominable man, "trust her with anything but a
      secret!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie," said Violante, with arch reproach, for she knew her father's
      humours too well to interpret his horrible sentiments literally,&mdash;"fie
      on your consistency, Padre Carissimo. Do you not trust your secret to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! A kitten is not a cat, and a girl is not a woman. Besides, the
      secret was already known to you, and I had no choice. Peace, Jemima will
      stay here for the present. See to what you wish to take with you; we shall
      leave to-night." Not waiting for an answer, Riccabocca hurried away, and
      with a firm step strode the terrace, and approached his wife. "Anima mia,"
      said the pupil of Machiavelli, disguising in the tenderest words the
      cruellest intentions,&mdash;for one of his most cherished Italian proverbs
      was to the effect that there is no getting on with a mule or a woman
      unless you coax them,&mdash;"Anima mia, soul of my being, you have already
      seen that Violante mopes herself to death here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She, poor child! Oh, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does, core of my heart,&mdash;she does, and is as ignorant of music
      as I am of tent-stitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She sings beautifully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as birds do, against all the rules, and in defiance of gamut.
      Therefore, to come to the point, O treasure of my soul! I am going to take
      her with me for a short time, perhaps to Cheltenham or Brighton. We shall
      see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All places with you are the same to me, Alphonso. When shall we go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall go to-night; but terrible as it is to part from you,&mdash;you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" interrupted the wife, and covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca, the wiliest and most relentless of men in his maxims, melted
      into absolute uxorial imbecility at the sight of that mute distress. He
      put his arm round his wife's waist, with genuine affection, and without a
      single proverb at his heart. "Carissima, do not grieve so; we shall be
      back soon, and travelling is expensive; rolling stones gather no moss, and
      there is so much to see to at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Riccabocca gently escaped from her husband's arm. She withdrew her
      hands from her face and brushed away the tears that stood in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alphonso," she said touchingly, "hear me! What you think good, that shall
      ever be good to me. But do not think that I grieve solely because of our
      parting. No; I grieve to think that, despite all these years in which I
      have been the partner of your hearth, and slept on your breast,&mdash;all
      these years in which I have had no thought but, however humbly, to do my
      duty to you and yours, and could have wished that you had read my heart,
      and seen there but yourself and your child,&mdash;I grieve to think that
      you still deem me as unworthy your trust as when you stood by my side at
      the altar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust!" repeated Riccabocca, startled and conscience-stricken; "why do
      you say 'trust'? In what have I distrusted you? I am sure," he continued,
      with the artful volubility of guilt, "that I never doubted your fidelity,
      hook-nosed, long-visaged foreigner though I be; never pryed into your
      letters; never inquired into your solitary walks; never heeded your
      flirtations with that good-looking Parson Dale; never kept the money; and
      never looked into the account-books!" Mrs. Riccabocca refused even a smile
      of contempt at these revolting evasions; nay, she seemed scarcely to hear
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you think," she resumed, pressing her hand on her heart to still its
      struggles for relief in sobs,&mdash;"can you think that I could have
      watched and thought and taxed my poor mind so constantly, to conjecture
      what might best soothe or please you, and not seen, long since, that you
      have secrets known to your daughter, your servant, not to me? Fear not,&mdash;the
      secrets cannot be evil, or you would not tell them to your innocent child.
      Besides, do I not know your nature; and do I not love you because I know
      it?&mdash;it is for something connected with those secrets that you leave
      your home. You think that I should be incautious, imprudent. You will not
      take me with you. Be it so. I go to prepare for your departure. Forgive me
      if I have displeased you, husband." Mrs. Riccabocca turned away; but a
      soft hand touched the Italian's arm. "O Father, can you resist this? Trust
      her! trust her!&mdash;I am a woman like her! I answer for her woman's
      faith. Be yourself,&mdash;ever nobler than all others, my own father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diavolo! Never one door shuts but another opens," groaned Riccabocca.
      "Are you a fool, child? Don't you see that it was for your sake only I
      feared, and would be cautious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For mine! Oh, then do not make me deem myself mean, and the cause of
      meanness. For mine! Am I not your daughter,&mdash;the descendant of men
      who never feared?" Violante looked sublime while she spoke; and as she
      ended she led her father gently on towards the door, which his wife had
      now gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jemima, wife mine! pardon, pardon," cried the Italian, whose heart had
      been yearning to repay such tenderness and devotion,&mdash;"come back to
      my breast&mdash;it has been long closed,&mdash;it shall be open to you now
      and forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment the wife was in her right place,&mdash;on her husband's
      bosom; and Violante, beautiful peacemaker, stood smiling awhile at both,
      and then lifted her eyes gratefully to heaven and stole away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Randal's return to town, he heard mixed and contradictory rumours in
      the streets, and at the clubs, of the probable downfall of the Government
      at the approaching session of parliament. These rumours had sprung up
      suddenly, as if in an hour. True that, for some time, the sagacious had
      shaken their heads and said, "Ministers could not last." True, that
      certain changes in policy, a year or two before, had divided the party on
      which the Government depended, and strengthened that which opposed it. But
      still the more important members of that Government had been so long
      identified with official station, and there seemed so little power in the
      Opposition to form a Cabinet of names familiar to official ears, that the
      general public had anticipated, at most, a few partial changes. Rumour now
      went far beyond this. Randal, whose whole prospects at present were but
      reflections from the greatness of his patron, was alarmed. He sought
      Egerton, but the minister was impenetrable, and seemed calm, confident,
      and imperturbed. Somewhat relieved, Randal then set himself to work to
      find a safe home for Riccabocca; for the greater need to succeed in
      obtaining fortune there, if he failed in getting it through Egerton. He
      found a quiet house, detached and secluded, in the neighbourhood of
      Norwood. No vicinity more secure from espionage and remark. He wrote to
      Riccabocca, and communicated the address, adding fresh assurances of his
      own power to be of use. The next morning he was seated in his office,
      thinking very little of the details, that he mastered, however, with
      mechanical precision, when the minister who presided over that department
      of the public service sent for him into his private room, and begged him
      to take a letter to Egerton, with whom he wished to consult relative to a
      very important point to be decided in the Cabinet that day. "I want you to
      take it," said the minister, smiling (the minister was a frank homely
      man), "because you are in Mr. Egerton's confidence, and he may give you
      some verbal message besides a written reply. Egerton is often over
      cautious and brief in the litera scripta."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal went first to Egerton's neighbouring office&mdash;Egerton had not
      been there that day. He then took a cabriolet and drove to Grosvenor
      Square. A quiet-looking chariot was at the door. Mr. Egerton was at home;
      but the servant said, "Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;- is with him, sir; and perhaps
      he may not like to be disturbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! is your master ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that I know of, sir. He never says he is ill. But he has looked
      poorly the last day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal hesitated a moment; but his commission might be important, and
      Egerton was a man who so held the maxim that health and all else must give
      way to business, that he resolved to enter; and, unannounced and
      unceremoniously, as was his wont, he opened the door of the library. He
      started as he did so. Audley Egerton was leaning back on the sofa, and the
      doctor, on his knees before him, was applying the stethoscope to his
      breast. Egerton's eyes were partially closed as the door opened. But at
      the noise he sprang up, nearly oversetting the doctor. "Who's that? How
      dare you?" he exclaimed, in a voice of great anger. Then recognizing
      Randal, he changed colour, bit his lip, and muttered dryly, "I beg pardon
      for my abruptness; what do you want, Mr. Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This letter from Lord&mdash;; I was told to deliver it immediately into
      your own hands. I beg pardon&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no cause," said Egerton, coldly. "I have had a slight attack of
      bronchitis; and as parliament meets so soon, I must take advice from my
      doctor, if I would be heard by the reporters. Lay the letter on the table,
      and be kind enough to wait for my reply."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal withdrew. He had never seen a physician in that house before, and
      it seemed surprising that Egerton should even take a medical opinion upon
      a slight attack. While waiting in the ante-room there was a knock at the
      street door, and presently a gentleman, exceedingly well dressed, was
      shown in, and honoured Randal with an easy and half-familiar bow. Randal
      remembered to have met this personage at dinner, and at the house of a
      young nobleman of high fashion, but had not been introduced to him, and
      did not even know him by name. The visitor was better informed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our friend Egerton is busy, I hear, Mr. Leslie," said he, arranging the
      camellia in his button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our friend Egerton!" It must be a very great man to say "Our friend
      Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not be engaged long, I dare say," returned Randal, glancing his
      shrewd inquiring eye over the stranger's person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust not; my time is almost as precious as his own. I was not so
      fortunate as to be presented to you when we met at Lord Spendquick's. Good
      fellow, Spendquick; and decidedly clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Spendquick was usually esteemed a gentleman without three ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean while the visitor had taken out a card from an embossed
      morocco case, and now presented it to Randal, who read thereon, "Baron
      Levy, No.&mdash;, Bruton St."
    </p>
    <p>
      The name was not unknown to Randal. It was a name too often on the lips of
      men of fashion not to have reached the ears of an habitue of good society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Levy had been a solicitor by profession. He had of late years
      relinquished his ostensible calling: and not long since, in consequence of
      some services towards the negotiation of a loan, had been created a baron
      by one of the German kings. The wealth of Mr. Levy was said to be only
      equalled by his good-nature to all who were in want of a temporary loan,
      and with sound expectations of repaying it some day or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      You seldom saw a finer-looking man than Baron Levy, about the same age as
      Egerton, but looking younger: so well preserved, such magnificent black
      whiskers, such superb teeth! Despite his name and his dark complexion, he
      did not, however, resemble a Jew,&mdash;at least externally; and, in fact,
      he was not a Jew on the father's side, but the natural son of a rich
      English grand seigneur, by a Hebrew lady of distinction&mdash;in the
      opera. After his birth, this lady had married a German trader of her own
      persuasion, and her husband had been prevailed upon, for the convenience
      of all parties, to adopt his wife's son, and accord to him his own Hebrew
      name. Mr. Levy, senior, was soon left a widower, and then the real father,
      though never actually owning the boy, had shown him great attention,&mdash;had
      him frequently at his house, initiated him betimes into his own high-born
      society, for which the boy showed great taste. But when my Lord died, and
      left but a moderate legacy to the younger Levy, who was then about
      eighteen, that ambiguous person was articled to an attorney by his
      putative sire, who shortly afterwards returned to his native land, and was
      buried at Prague, where his tombstone may yet be seen. Young Levy,
      however, contrived to do very well without him. His real birth was
      generally known, and rather advantageous to him in a social point of view.
      His legacy enabled him to become a partner where he had been a clerk, and
      his practice became great amongst the fashionable classes of society.
      Indeed he was so useful, so pleasant, so much a man of the world, that he
      grew intimate with his clients,&mdash;chiefly young men of rank; was on
      good terms with both Jew and Christian; and being neither one nor the
      other, resembled (to use Sheridan's incomparable simile) the blank page
      between the Old and the New Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vulgar some might call Mr. Levy from his assurance, but it was not the
      vulgarity of a man accustomed to low and coarse society,&mdash;rather the
      mauvais ton of a person not sure of his own position, but who has resolved
      to swagger into the best one he can get. When it is remembered that he had
      made his way in the world, and gleaned together an immense fortune, it is
      needless to add that he was as sharp as a needle, and as hard as a flint.
      No man had had more friends, and no man had stuck by them more firmly&mdash;so
      long as there was a pound in their pockets!
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this character had Randal heard of the baron, and he now
      gazed, first at his card, and then at him with&mdash;admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I met a friend of yours at Borrowell's the other day," resumed the baron,&mdash;"young
      Hazeldean. Careful fellow&mdash;quite a man of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      As this was the last praise poor Frank deserved, Randal again smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron went on: "I hear, Mr. Leslie, that you have much influence over
      this same Hazeldean. His affairs are in a sad state. I should be very
      happy to be of use to him, as a relation of my friend Egerton's; but he
      understands business so well that he despises my advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you do him injustice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Injustice! I honour his caution. I say to every man, 'Don't come to me: I
      can get you money on much easier terms than any one else; and what's the
      result! You come so often that you ruin yourself; whereas a regular usurer
      without conscience frightens you. 'Cent percent,' you say; 'oh, I must
      pull in.' If you have influence over your friend, tell him to stick to his
      bill-brokers, and have nothing to do with Baron Levy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the minister's bell rung, and Randal, looking through the window, saw
      Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;- walking to his carriage, which had made way for Baron
      Levy's splendid cabriolet,&mdash;a cabriolet in the most perfect taste,
      baron's coronet on the dark-brown panels, horse black, with such action!
      harness just relieved with plating. The servant now entered, and requested
      Randal to step in; and addressing the baron, assured him that he would not
      be detained a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leslie," said the minister, sealing a note, "take this back to Lord
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, and say that I shall be with him in an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No other message?&mdash;he seemed to expect one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say he did. Well, my letter is official, my message is not: beg
      him to see Mr. &mdash;&mdash;- before we meet,&mdash;he will understand,&mdash;all
      rests upon that interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton then, extending the letter, resumed gravely, "Of course you will
      not mention to any one that Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;- was with me: the health
      of public men is not to be suspected. Hum,&mdash;were you in your own room
      or the ante-room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ante-room, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton's brow contracted slightly. "And Mr. Levy was there, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;the baron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baron! true. Come to plague me about the Mexican loan, I suppose. I will
      keep you no longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal, much meditating, left the house, and re-entered his hack cab. The
      baron was admitted to the statesman's presence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Egerton had thrown himself at full length on the sofa, a position
      exceedingly rare with him; and about his whole air and manner, as Levy
      entered, there was something singularly different from that stateliness of
      port common to the austere legislator. The very tone of his voice was
      different. It was as if the statesman, the man of business, had vanished;
      it was rather the man of fashion and the idler who, nodding languidly to
      his visitor, said, "Levy, what money can I have for a year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The estate will bear very little more. My dear fellow, that last election
      was the very devil. You cannot go on thus much longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow!" Baron Levy hailed Audley Egerton as "my dear fellow"!
      And Audley Egerton, perhaps, saw nothing strange in the words, though his
      lip curled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not want to go on thus much longer," answered Egerton, as the
      curl on his lip changed to a gloomy smile. "The estate must, meanwhile,
      bear L5,000 more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hard pull on it. You had really better sell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot afford to sell at present. I cannot afford men to say, 'Audley
      Egerton is done up,&mdash;his property is for sale.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very sad when one thinks what a rich man you have been&mdash;and
      may be yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be yet! How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Baron Levy glanced towards the thick mahogany doors,&mdash;thick and
      impervious, as should be the doors of statesmen. "Why, you know that, with
      three words from you, I could produce an effect upon the stocks of three
      nations, that might give us each a hundred thousand pounds. We would go
      shares."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Levy," said Egerton, coldly, though a deep blush overspread his face,
      "you are a scoundrel; that is your look-out. I interfere with no man's
      tastes and conscience. I don't intend to be a scoundrel myself. I have
      told you that long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      The usurer's brows darkened, but he dispelled the cloud with an easy
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, "you are neither wise nor complimentary, but you shall
      have the money. But yet, would it not be better," added Levy, with
      emphasis, "to borrow it without interest, of your friend L'Estrange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton started as if stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean to taunt me, sir!" he exclaimed passionately. "I accept
      pecuniary favours from Lord L'Estrange!&mdash;I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut, my dear Egerton, I dare say my Lord would not think so ill now of
      that act in your life which&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" exclaimed Egerton, writhing. "Hold!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and paced the room, muttering, in broken sentences, "To blush
      before this man! Chastisement, chastisement!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy gazed on him with hard and sinister eyes. The minister turned
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look you, Levy," said he, with forced composure, "you hate me&mdash;why,
      I know not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hate you! How have I shown hatred? Would you ever have lived in this
      palace, and ruled this country as one of the most influential of its
      ministers, but for my management, my whispers to the wealthy Miss Leslie?
      Come, but for me what would you have been,&mdash;perhaps a beggar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I be now, if I live? And this fortune which my marriage
      brought to me&mdash;it has passed for the main part into your hands. Be
      patient, you will have it all ere long. But there is one man in the world
      who has loved me from a boy, and woe to you if ever he learn that he has
      the right to despise me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egerton, my good fellow," said Levy, with great composure, "you need not
      threaten me, for what interest can I possibly have in tale-telling to Lord
      L'Estrange? Again, dismiss from your mind the absurd thought that I hate
      you. True, you snub me in private, you cut me in public, you refuse to
      come to my dinners, you'll not ask me to your own; still, there is no man
      I like better, nor would more willingly serve. When do you want the
      L5,000?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps in one month, perhaps not for three or four. Let it be ready when
      required."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough; depend on it. Have you any other commands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take my leave, then. By-the-by, what do you suppose the Hazeldean
      rental is worth&mdash;net?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, nor care. You have no designs upon that too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I like keeping up family connections. Mr. Frank seems a liberal
      young gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Egerton could answer, the baron had glided to the door, and,
      nodding pleasantly, vanished with that nod. Egerton remained, standing on
      his solitary hearth. A drear, single man's room it was, from wall to wall,
      despite its fretted ceilings and official pomp of Brahmah escritoires and
      red boxes. Drear and cheerless,&mdash;no trace of woman's habitation, no
      vestige of intruding, happy children. There stood the austere man alone.
      And then with a deep sigh he muttered, "Thank Heaven, not for long,&mdash;it
      will not last long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeating those words, he mechanically locked up his papers, and pressed
      his hand to his heart for an instant, as if a spasm had shot through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So&mdash;I must shun all emotion!" said he, shaking his head gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes more Audley Egerton was in the streets, his mien erect,
      and his step firm as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That man is made of bronze," said a leader of the Opposition to a friend
      as they rode past the minister. "What would I not give for his nerves!"

      INITIAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON PUBLIC LIFE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that I am fairly in the heart of my story, these preliminary chapters
      must shrink into comparatively small dimensions, and not encroach upon the
      space required by the various personages whose acquaintance I have picked
      up here and there, and who are now all crowding upon me like poor
      relations to whom one has unadvisedly given a general invitation, and who
      descend upon one simultaneously about Christmas time. Where they are to be
      stowed, and what is to become of them all, Heaven knows; in the mean
      while, the reader will have already observed that the Caxton Family
      themselves are turned out of their own rooms, sent a packing, in order to
      make way for the new comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to proceed: Note the heading to the present Chapter, "ON PUBLIC LIFE,"&mdash;a
      thesis pertinent to this portion of my narrative; and if somewhat trite in
      itself, the greater is the stimulus to suggest thereon some original hints
      for reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were you ever in public life, my dear reader? I don't mean, by that
      question, to ask whether you were ever Lord Chancellor, Prime Minister,
      Leader of the Opposition, or even a member of the House of Commons. An
      author hopes to find readers far beyond that very egregious but very
      limited segment of the Great Circle. Were you ever a busy man in your
      vestry, active in a municipal corporation, one of a committee for
      furthering the interests of an enlightened candidate for your native
      burgh, town, or shire,&mdash;in a word, did you ever resign your private
      comforts as men in order to share the public troubles of mankind? If ever
      you have so far departed from the Lucretian philosophy, just look back&mdash;was
      it life at all that you lived? Were you an individual distinct existence,&mdash;a
      passenger in the railway,&mdash;or were you merely an indistinct portion
      of that common flame which heated the boiler and generated the steam that
      set off the monster train?&mdash;very hot, very active, very useful, no
      doubt; but all your identity fused in flame, and all your forces vanishing
      in gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      And do you think the people in the railway carriages care for you? Do you
      think that the gentleman in the worsted wrapper is saying to his neighbour
      with the striped rug on his comfortable knees, "How grateful we ought to
      be for that fiery particle which is crackling and hissing under the
      boiler. It helps us on a fraction of an inch from Vauxhall to Putney!" Not
      a bit of it. Ten to one but he is saying, "Not sixteen miles an hour! What
      the deuce is the matter with the stoker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at our friend Audley Egerton. You have just had a glimpse of the real
      being that struggles under the huge copper; you have heard the hollow
      sound of the rich man's coffers under the tap of Baron Levy's friendly
      knuckle, heard the strong man's heart give out its dull warning sound to
      the scientific ear of Dr. F&mdash;&mdash;-. And away once more vanishes
      the separate existence, lost again in the flame that heats the boiler, and
      the smoke that curls into air from the grimy furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look to it, O Public Man, whoever thou art, and whatsoever thy degree,&mdash;see
      if thou canst not compound matters, so as to keep a little nook apart for
      thy private life; that is, for thyself! Let the Great Popkins Question not
      absorb wholly the individual soul of thee, as Smith or Johnson. Don't so
      entirely consume thyself under that insatiable boiler, that when thy poor
      little monad rushes out from the sooty furnace, and arrives at the stars,
      thou mayest find no vocation for thee there, and feel as if thou hadst
      nothing to do amidst the still splendours of the Infinite. I don't deny to
      thee the uses of "Public Life;" I grant that it is much to have helped to
      carry that Great Popkins Question; but Private Life, my friend, is the
      life of thy private soul; and there may be matters concerned with that
      which, on consideration, thou mayest allow cannot be wholly mixed up with
      the Great Popkins Question, and were not finally settled when thou didst
      exclaim, "I have not lived in vain,&mdash;the Popkins Question is carried
      at last!" Oh, immortal soul, for one quarter of an hour per diem
      de-Popkinize thine immortality!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had not been without much persuasion on the part of Jackeymo that
      Riccabocca had consented to settle himself in the house which Randal had
      recommended to him. Not that the exile conceived any suspicion of the
      young man beyond that which he might have shared with Jackeymo, namely,
      that Randal's interest in the father was increased by a very natural and
      excusable admiration of the daughter; but the Italian had the pride common
      to misfortune,&mdash;he did not like to be indebted to others, and he
      shrank from the pity of those to whom it was known that he had held a
      higher station in his own land. These scruples gave way to the strength of
      his affection for his daughter and his dread of his foe. Good men, however
      able and brave, who have suffered from the wicked, are apt to form
      exaggerated notions of the power that has prevailed against them. Jackeymo
      had conceived a superstitious terror of Peschiera; and Riccabocca, though
      by no means addicted to superstition, still had a certain creep of the
      flesh whenever he thought of his foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Riccabocca&mdash;than whom no man was more physically brave, and no
      man, in some respects, more morally timid&mdash;feared the count less as a
      foe than as a gallant. He remembered his kinsman's surpassing beauty, the
      power he had obtained over women. He knew him versed in every art that
      corrupts, and wholly void of the conscience that deters. And Riccabocca
      had unhappily nursed himself into so poor an estimate of the female
      character, that even the pure and lofty nature of Violante did not seem to
      him a sufficient safeguard against the craft and determination of a
      practised and remorseless intriguer. But of all the precautions he could
      take, none appeared more likely to conduce to safety than his establishing
      a friendly communication with one who professed to be able to get at all
      the count's plans and movements, and who could apprise Riccabocca at once
      should his retreat be discovered. "Forewarned is forearmed," said he to
      himself, in one of the proverbs common to all nations. However, as with
      his usual sagacity he came to reflect upon the alarming intelligence
      conveyed to him by Randal, namely, that the count sought his daughter's
      hand, he divined that there was some strong personal interest under such
      ambition; and what could be that interest save the probability of
      Riccabocca's ultimate admission to the Imperial grace, and the count's
      desire to assure himself of the heritage to an estate that he might be
      permitted to retain no more? Riccabocca was not indeed aware of the
      condition (not according to usual customs in Austria) on which the count
      held the forfeited domains. He knew not that they had been granted merely
      on pleasure; but he was too well aware of Peschiera's nature to suppose
      that he would woo a bride without a dower, or be moved by remorse in any
      overture of reconciliation. He felt assured too&mdash;and this increased
      all his fears&mdash;that Peschiera would never venture to seek an
      interview with himself; all the count's designs on Violante would be dark,
      secret, and clandestine. He was perplexed and tormented by the doubt
      whether or not to express openly to Violante his apprehensions of the
      nature of the danger to be apprehended. He had told her vaguely that it
      was for her sake that he desired secrecy and concealment. But that might
      mean anything: what danger to himself would not menace her? Yet to say
      more was so contrary to a man of his Italian notions and Machiavellian
      maxims! To say to a young girl, "There is a man come over to England on
      purpose to woo and win you. For Heaven's sake take care of him; he is
      diabolically handsome; he never fails where he sets his heart.&mdash;Cospetto!"
      cried the doctor, aloud, as these admonitions shaped themselves to speech
      in the camera obscura of his brain; "such a warning would have undone a
      Cornelia while she was yet an innocent spinster." No, he resolved to say
      nothing to Violante of the count's intention, only to keep guard, and make
      himself and Jackeymo all eyes and all ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house Randal had selected pleased Riccabocca at first glance. It stood
      alone, upon a little eminence; its upper windows commanded the high road.
      It had been a school, and was surrounded by high walls, which contained a
      garden and lawn sufficiently large for exercise. The garden doors were
      thick, fortified by strong bolts, and had a little wicket lattice, shut
      and opened at pleasure, from which Jackeymo could inspect all visitors
      before he permitted them to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old female servant from the neighbourhood was cautiously hired;
      Riccabocca renounced his Italian name, and abjured his origin. He spoke
      English sufficiently well to think he could pass as an Englishman. He
      called himself Mr. Richmouth (a liberal translation of Riccabocca). He
      bought a blunderbuss, two pairs of pistols, and a huge housedog. Thus
      provided for, he allowed Jackeymo to write a line to Randal and
      communicate his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal lost no time in calling. With his usual adaptability and his powers
      of dissimulation, he contrived easily to please Mrs. Riccabocca, and to
      increase the good opinion the exile was disposed to form of him. He
      engaged Violante in conversation on Italy and its poets. He promised to
      bring her books. He began, though more distantly than he could have
      desired,&mdash;for her sweet stateliness awed him,&mdash;the preliminaries
      of courtship. He established himself at once as a familiar guest, riding
      down daily in the dusk of evening, after the toils of office, and
      returning at night. In four or five days he thought he had made great
      progress with all. Riccabocca watched him narrowly, and grew absorbed in
      thought after every visit. At length one night, when he and Mrs.
      Riccabocca were alone in the drawing-room, Violante having retired to
      rest, he thus spoke as he filled his pipe,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happy is the man who has no children! Thrice happy he who has no girls!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Alphonso!" said the wife, looking up from the waistband to which
      she was attaching a neat mother-o'-pearl button. She said no more; it was
      the sharpest rebuke she was in the custom of administering to her
      husband's cynical and odious observations. Riccabocca lighted his pipe
      with a thread paper, gave three great puffs, and resumed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "One blunderbuss, four pistols, and a house-dog called Pompey, who would
      have made mincemeat of Julius Caesar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He certainly eats a great deal, does Pompey!" said Mrs. Riccabocca,
      simply. "But if he relieves your mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not relieve it in the least, ma'am," groaned Riccabocca; "and
      that is the point I am coming to. This is a most harassing life, and a
      most undignified life. And I who have only asked from Heaven dignity and
      repose! But if Violante were once married, I should want neither
      blunderbuss, pistol, nor Pompey. And it is that which would relieve my
      mind, cara mia,&mdash;Pompey only relieves my larder."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Riccabocca had been more communicative to Jemima than he had been to
      Violante. Having once trusted her with one secret, he had every motive to
      trust her with another; and he had accordingly spoken out his fears of the
      Count di Peschiera. Therefore she answered, laying down the work, and
      taking her husband's hand tenderly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, my love, since you dread so much (though I own that I must think
      unreasonably) this wicked, dangerous man, it would be the happiest thing
      in the world to see dear Violante well married; because, you see, if she
      is married to one person she cannot be married to another; and all fear of
      this count, as you say, would be at an end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot express yourself better. It is a great comfort to unbosom
      one's-self to a wife, after all," quoth Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said the wife, after a grateful kiss,&mdash;"but where and how can
      we find a husband suitable to the rank of your daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! there! there!" cried Riccabocca, pushing back his chair to the
      farther end of the room, "that comes of unbosoming one's-self! Out flies
      one secret; it is opening the lid of Pandora's box; one is betrayed,
      ruined, undone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, there's not a soul that can hear us!" said Mrs. Riccabocca,
      soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'That's chance, ma'am! If you once contract the habit of blabbing out a
      secret when nobody's by, how on earth can you resist it when you have the
      pleasurable excitement of telling it to all the world? Vanity, vanity,&mdash;woman's
      vanity! Woman never could withstand rank,&mdash;never!" The doctor went on
      railing for a quarter of an hour, and was very reluctantly appeased by
      Mrs. Riccabocca's repeated and tearful assurances that she would never
      even whisper to herself that her husband had ever held any other rank than
      that of doctor. Riccabocca, with a dubious shake of the head, renewed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done with all pomp and pretension. Besides, the young man is a
      born gentleman: he seems in good circumstances; he has energy and latent
      ambition; he is akin to L'Estrange's intimate friend: he seems attached to
      Violante. I don't think it probable that we could do better. Nay, if
      Peschiera fears that I shall be restored to my country, and I learn the
      wherefore, and the ground to take, through this young man&mdash;why,
      gratitude is the first virtue of the noble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak, then, of Mr. Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure&mdash;of whom else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Riccabocca leaned her cheek on her hand thoughtfully. "Now you have
      told me that, I will observe him with different eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anima mia, I don't see how the difference of your eyes will alter the
      object they look upon!" grumbled Riccabocca, shaking the ashes out of his
      pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The object alters when we see it in a different point of view!" replied
      Jemima, modestly. "This thread does very well when I look at it in order
      to sew on a button, but I should say it would never do to tie up Pompey in
      his Kennel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reasoning by illustration, upon my soul!" ejaculated Riccabocca, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," continued Jemima, "when I am to regard one who is to constitute the
      happiness of that dear child, and for life, can I regard him as I would
      the pleasant guest of an evening? Ah, trust me, Alphonso; I don't pretend
      to be wise like you; but when a woman considers what a man is likely to
      prove to woman,&mdash;his sincerity, his honour, his heart,&mdash;oh,
      trust me, she is wiser than the wisest man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca continued to gaze on Jemima with unaffected admiration and
      surprise. And certainly, to use his phrase, since he had unbosomed himself
      to his better half, since he had confided in her, consulted with her, her
      sense had seemed to quicken, her whole mind to expand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said the sage, "I vow and declare that Machiavelli was a fool
      to you. And I have been as dull as the chair I sit upon, to deny myself so
      many years the comfort and counsel of such a&mdash;But, corpo di Bacco!
      forget all about rank; and so now to bed.&mdash;One must not holloa till
      one's out of the wood," muttered the ungrateful, suspicious villain, as he
      lighted the chamber candle.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      RICCABOCCA could not confine himself to the precincts within the walls to
      which he condemned Violante. Resuming his spectacles, and wrapped in his
      cloak, he occasionally sallied forth upon a kind of outwatch or
      reconnoitring expedition,&mdash;restricting himself, however, to the
      immediate neighbourhood, and never going quite out of sight of his house.
      His favourite walk was to the summit of a hillock overgrown with stunted
      bush-wood. Here he would sit himself musingly, often till the hoofs of
      Randal's horse rang on the winding road, as the sun set, over fading
      herbage, red and vaporous, in autumnal skies. Just below the hillock, and
      not two hundred yards from his own house, was the only other habitation in
      view,&mdash;a charming, thoroughly English cottage, though somewhat
      imitated from the Swiss, with gable ends, thatched roof, and pretty,
      projecting casements, opening through creepers and climbing roses. From
      his height he commanded the gardens of this cottage, and his eye of artist
      was pleased, from the first sight, with the beauty which some exquisite
      taste had given to the ground. Even in that cheerless season of the year,
      the garden wore a summer smile; the evergreens were so bright and various,
      and the few flow ers still left so hardy and so healthful. Facing the
      south, a colonnade, or covered gallery, of rustic woodwork had been
      formed, and creeping plants, lately set, were already beginning to clothe
      its columns. Opposite to this colonnade there was a fountain which
      reminded Riccabocca of his own at the deserted Casino. It was indeed
      singularly like it; the same circular shape, the same girdle of flowers
      around it. But the jet from it varied every day, fantastic and multiform,
      like the sports of a Naiad,&mdash;sometimes shooting up like a tree,
      sometimes shaped as a convolvulus, sometimes tossing from its silver spray
      a flower of vermilion, or a fruit of gold,&mdash;as if at play with its
      toy like a happy child. And near the fountain was a large aviary, large
      enough to enclose a tree. The Italian could just catch a gleam of rich
      colour from the wings of the birds, as they glanced to and fro within the
      network, and could hear their songs, contrasting the silence of the freer
      populace of air, whom the coming winter had already stilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca's eye, so alive to all aspects of beauty, luxuriated in the
      view of this garden. Its pleasantness had a charm that stole him from his
      anxious fear and melancholy memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never saw but two forms within the demesnes, and he could not
      distinguish their features. One was a woman, who seemed to him of staid
      manner and homely appearance: she was seen but rarely. The other a man,
      often pacing to and fro the colonnade, with frequent pauses before the
      playful fountain, or the birds that sang louder as he approached. This
      latter form would then disappear within a room, the glass door of which
      was at the extreme end of the colonnade; and if the door were left open,
      Riccabocca could catch a glimpse of the figure bending over a table
      covered with books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always, however, before the sun set, the man would step forth more
      briskly, and occupy himself with the garden, often working at it with good
      heart, as if at a task of delight; and then, too, the woman would come
      out, and stand by as if talking to her companion. Riccabocca's curiosity
      grew aroused. He bade Jemima inquire of the old maid-servant who lived at
      the cottage, and heard that its owner was a Mr. Oran,&mdash;a quiet
      gentleman, and fond of his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Riccabocca thus amused himself, Randal had not been prevented,
      either by his official cares or his schemes on Violante's heart and
      fortune, from furthering the project that was to unite Frank Hazeldean and
      Beatrice di Negra. Indeed, as to the first, a ray of hope was sufficient
      to fire the ardent and unsuspecting lover. And Randal's artful
      misrepresentation of his conference with Mrs. Hazeldean removed all fear
      of parental displeasure from a mind always too disposed to give itself up
      to the temptation of the moment. Beatrice, though her feelings for Frank
      were not those of love, became more and more influenced by Randal's
      arguments and representations, the more especially as her brother grew
      morose, and even menacing, as days slipped on, and she could give no clew
      to the retreat of those whom he sought for. Her debts, too, were really
      urgent. As Randal's profound knowledge of human infirmity had shrewdly
      conjectured, the scruples of honour and pride, that had made her declare
      she would not bring to a husband her own encumbrances, began to yield to
      the pressure of necessity. She listened already, with but faint
      objections, when Randal urged her not to wait for the uncertain discovery
      that was to secure her dowry, but by a private marriage with Frank escape
      at once into freedom and security. While, though he had first held out to
      young Hazeldean the inducement of Beatrice's dowry as a reason of
      self-justification in the eyes of the squire, it was still easier to drop
      that inducement, which had always rather damped than fired the high spirit
      and generous heart of the poor Guardsman. And Randal could conscientiously
      say, that when he had asked the squire if he expected fortune with Frank's
      bride, the squire had replied, "I don't care." Thus encouraged by his
      friend and his own heart, and the softening manner of a woman who might
      have charmed many a colder, and fooled many a wiser man, Frank rapidly
      yielded to the snares held out for his perdition. And though as yet he
      honestly shrank from proposing to Beatrice or himself a marriage without
      the consent, and even the knowledge, of his parents, yet Randal was quite
      content to leave a nature, however good, so thoroughly impulsive and
      undisciplined, to the influences of the first strong passion it had ever
      known. Meanwhile, it was so easy to dissuade Frank from even giving a hint
      to the folks at home. "For," said the wily and able traitor, "though we
      may be sure of Mrs. Hazeldean's consent, and her power over your father,
      when the step is once taken, yet we cannot count for certain on the
      squire, he is so choleric and hasty. He might hurry to town, see Madame di
      Negra, blurt out some passionate, rude expressions, which would wake her
      resentment, and cause her instant rejection. And it might be too late if
      he repented afterwards, as he would be sure to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Randal Leslie gave a dinner at the Clarendon Hotel (an
      extravagance most contrary to his habits), and invited Frank, Mr.
      Borrowell, and Baron Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this house-spider, which glided with so much ease after its flies,
      through webs so numerous and mazy, had yet to amuse Madame di Negra with
      assurances that the fugitives sought for would sooner or later be
      discovered. Though Randal baffled and eluded her suspicion that he was
      already acquainted with the exiles ("the persons he had thought of were,"
      he said, "quite different from her description;" and he even presented to
      her an old singing-master and a sallow-faced daughter, as the Italians who
      had caused his mistake), it was necessary for Beatrice to prove the
      sincerity of the aid she had promised to her brother, and to introduce
      Randal to the count. It was no less desirable to Randal to know, and even
      win the confidence of this man&mdash;his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two met at Madame di Negra's house. There is something very strange,
      and almost mesmerical, in the rapport between two evil natures. Bring two
      honest men together, and it is ten to one if they recognize each other as
      honest; differences in temper, manner, even politics, may make each
      misjudge the other. But bring together two men unprincipled and perverted&mdash;men
      who, if born in a cellar, would have been food for the hulks or gallows&mdash;and
      they understand each other by instant sympathy. The eyes of Franzini,
      Count of Peschiera, and Randal Leslie no sooner met than a gleam of
      intelligence shot from both. They talked on indifferent subjects,&mdash;weather,
      gossip, politics,&mdash;what not. They bowed and they smiled; but all the
      while, each was watching, plumbing the other's heart, each measuring his
      strength with his companion; each inly saying, "This is a very remarkable
      rascal; am I a match for him?" It was at dinner they met; and following
      the English fashion, Madame di Negra left them alone with their wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for the first time, Count di Peschiera cautiously and adroitly made
      a covered push towards the object of the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have never been abroad, my dear sir? You must contrive to visit me at
      Vienna. I grant the splendour of your London world; but, honestly
      speaking, it wants the freedom of ours,&mdash;a freedom which unites
      gayety with polish. For as your society is mixed, there are pretension and
      effort with those who have no right to be in it, and artificial
      condescension and chilling arrogance with those who have to keep their
      inferiors at a certain distance. With us, all being of fixed rank and
      acknowledged birth, familiarity is at once established. Hence," added the
      count, with his French lively smile,&mdash;"hence there is no place like
      Vienna for a young man, no place like Vienna for bonnes fortunes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those make the paradise of the idle," replied Randal, "but the purgatory
      of the busy. I confess frankly to you, my dear count, that I have as
      little of the leisure which becomes the aspirer to bonnes fortunes as I
      have the personal graces which obtain them without an effort;" and he
      inclined his head as in compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," thought the count, "woman is not his weak side. What is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morbleu! my dear Mr. Leslie, had I thought as you do some years since, I
      had saved myself from many a trouble. After all, Ambition is the best
      mistress to woo; for with her there is always the hope, and never the
      possession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ambition, Count," replied Randal, still guarding himself in dry
      sententiousness, "is the luxury of the rich, and the necessity of the
      poor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha," thought the count, "it comes, as I anticipated from the first,&mdash;comes
      to the bribe." He passed the wine to Randal, filling his own glass, and
      draining it carelessly; "Sur mon ame, mon cher," said the count, "luxury
      is ever pleasanter than necessity; and I am resolved at least to give
      Ambition a trial; je vais me refugier dans le sein du bonheur domestique,&mdash;a
      married life and a settled home. Peste! If it were not for ambition, one
      would die of ennui. A propos, my dear sir, I have to thank you for
      promising my sister your aid in finding a near and dear kinsman of mine,
      who has taken refuge in your country, and hides himself even from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be most happy to assist in your search. As yet, however, I have
      only to regret that all my good wishes are fruitless. I should have
      thought, however, that a man of such rank had been easily found, even
      through the medium of your own ambassador."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our own ambassador is no very warm friend of mine; and the rank would be
      no clew, for it is clear that my kinsman has never assumed it since he
      quitted his country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He quitted it, I understand, not exactly from choice," said Randal,
      smiling. "Pardon my freedom and curiosity, but will you explain to me a
      little more than I learn from English rumour (which never accurately
      reports upon foreign matters still more notorious), how a person who had
      so much to lose, and so little to win, by revolution, could put himself
      into the same crazy boat with a crew of hair-brained adventurers and
      visionary professors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Professors!" repeated the count; "I think you have hit on the very answer
      to your question; not but what men of high birth were as mad as the
      canaille. I am the more willing to gratify your curiosity, since it will
      perhaps serve to guide your kind search in my favour. You must know, then,
      that my kinsman was not born the heir to the rank he obtained. He was but
      a distant relation to the head of the House which he afterwards
      represented. Brought up in an Italian university, he was distinguished for
      his learning and his eccentricities. There too, I suppose, brooding over
      old wives' tales about freedom, and so forth, he contracted his carbonaro,
      chimerical notions for the independence of Italy. Suddenly, by three
      deaths, he was elevated, while yet young, to a station and honours which
      might have satisfied any man in his senses. Que diable! what could the
      independence of Italy do for him? He and I were cousins; we had played
      together as boys; but our lives had been separated till his succession to
      rank brought us necessarily together. We became exceedingly intimate. And
      you may judge how I loved him," said the count, averting his eyes slightly
      from Randal's quiet, watchful gaze, "when I add, that I forgave him for
      enjoying a heritage that, but for him, had been mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you were next heir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is a hard trial to be very near a great fortune, and yet just to
      miss it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," cried Randal, almost impetuously. The count now raised his eyes,
      and again the two men looked into each other's souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harder still, perhaps," resumed the count, after a short pause,&mdash;"harder
      still might it have been to some men to forgive the rival as well as the
      heir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rival! how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lady, who had been destined by her parents to myself, though we had
      never, I own, been formally betrothed, became the wife of my kinsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he know of your pretensions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do him the justice to say he did not. He saw and fell in love with the
      young lady I speak of. Her parents were dazzled. Her father sent for me.
      He apologized, he explained; he set before me, mildly enough, certain
      youthful imprudences or errors of my own, as an excuse for his change of
      mind; and he asked me not only to resign all hope of his daughter, but to
      conceal from her new suitor that I had ever ventured to hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you consented?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I consented."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was generous. You must indeed have been much attached to your
      kinsman. As a lover, I cannot comprehend it; perhaps, my dear count, you
      may enable me to understand it better&mdash;as a man of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the count, with his most roue air, "I suppose we are both men
      of the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both! certainly," replied Randal, just in the tone which Peachum might
      have used in courting the confidence of Lockit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a man of the world, then, I own," said the count, playing with the
      rings on his fingers, "that if I could not marry the lady myself (and that
      seemed to me clear), it was very natural that I should wish to see her
      married to my wealthy kinsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very natural; it might bring your wealthy kinsman and yourself still
      closer together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is really a very clever fellow!" thought the count, but he made no
      direct reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enfin, to cut short a long story, my cousin afterwards got entangled in
      attempts, the failure of which is historically known. His projects were
      detected, himself denounced. He fled, and the emperor, in sequestrating
      his estates, was pleased, with rare and singular clemency, to permit me,
      as his nearest kinsman, to enjoy the revenues of half those estates during
      the royal pleasure; nor was the other half formally confiscated. It was no
      doubt his Majesty's desire not to extinguish a great Italian name; and if
      my cousin and his child died in exile, why, of that name, I, a loyal
      subject of Austria,&mdash;I, Franzini, Count di Peschiera, would become
      the representative. Such, in a similar case, has been sometimes the
      Russian policy towards Polish insurgents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I comprehend perfectly; and I can also conceive that you, in profiting so
      largely, though so justly, by the fall of your kinsman, may have been
      exposed to much unpopularity, even to painful suspicion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entre nous, mon cher, I care not a stiver for popularity; and as to
      suspicion, who is he that can escape from the calumny of the envious? But,
      unquestionably, it would be most desirable to unite the divided members of
      our house; and this union I can now effect by the consent of the emperor
      to my marriage with my kinsman's daughter. You see, therefore, why I have
      so great an interest in this research?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the marriage articles you could no doubt secure the retention of the
      half you hold; and if you survive your kinsman, you would enjoy the whole.
      A most desirable marriage; and, if made, I suppose that would suffice to
      obtain your cousin's amnesty and grace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But even without such marriage, since the emperor's clemency has been
      extended to so many of the proscribed, it is perhaps probable that your
      cousin might be restored?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It once seemed to me possible," said the count, reluctantly; "but since I
      have been in England, I think not. The recent revolution in France, the
      democratic spirit rising in Europe, tend to throw back the cause of a
      proscribed rebel. England swarms with revolutionists; my cousin's
      residence in this country is in itself suspicious. The suspicion is
      increased by his strange seclusion. There are many Italians here who would
      aver that they had met with him, and that he was still engaged in
      revolutionary projects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aver&mdash;untruly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma foi, it comes to the same thing; 'les absents ont toujours tort.' I
      speak to a man of the world. No; without some such guarantee for his faith
      as his daughter's marriage with myself would give, his recall is
      improbable. By the heaven above us, it shall be impossible!" The count
      rose as he said this,&mdash;rose as if the mask of simulation had fairly
      fallen from the visage of crime; rose tall and towering, a very image of
      masculine power and strength, beside the slight, bended form and sickly
      face of the intellectual schemer. And had you seen them thus confronted
      and contrasted, you would have felt that if ever the time should come when
      the interest of the one would compel him openly to denounce or boldly to
      expose the other, the odds were that the brilliant and audacious reprobate
      would master the weaker nerve but superior wit of the furtive traitor.
      Randal was startled; but rising also, he said carelessly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if this guarantee can no longer be given; what if, in despair of
      return, and in resignation to his altered fortunes, your cousin has
      already married his daughter to some English suitor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that would indeed be, next to my own marriage with her, the most
      fortunate thing that could happen to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? I don't understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, if my cousin has so abjured his birthright, and forsworn his rank;
      if this heritage, which is so dangerous from its grandeur, pass, in case
      of his pardon, to some obscure Englishman,&mdash;a foreigner, a native of
      a country that has no ties with ours, a country that is the very refuge of
      levellers and Carbonari&mdash;mort de ma vie! do you think that such would
      not annihilate all chance of my cousin's restoration, and be an excuse
      even in the eyes of Italy for formally conferring the sequestrated estates
      on an Italian? No; unless, indeed, the girl were to marry an Englishman of
      such name and birth and connection as would in themselves be a guarantee
      (and how in poverty is this likely?) I should go back to Vienna with a
      light heart, if I could say, 'My kinswoman is an Englishman's wife; shall
      her children be the heirs to a house so renowned for its lineage, and so
      formidable for its wealth?' Parbleu! if my cousin were but an adventurer,
      or merely a professor, he had been pardoned long ago. The great enjoy the
      honour not to be pardoned easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal fell into deep but brief thought. The count observed him, not face
      to face, but by the reflection of an opposite mirror. "This man knows
      something; this man is deliberating; this man can help me," thought the
      count.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Randal said nothing to confirm these hypotheses. Recovering from his
      abstraction, he expressed courteously his satisfaction at the count's
      prospects, either way. "And since, after all," he added, "you mean so well
      to your cousin, it occurs to me that you might discover him by a very
      simple English process."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Advertise that, if he will come to some place appointed, he will hear of
      something to his advantage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The count shook his head. "He would suspect me, and not come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he was intimate with you. He joined an insurrection; you were more
      prudent. You did not injure him, though you may have benefited yourself.
      Why should he shun you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The conspirators forgive none who do not conspire; besides, to speak
      frankly, he thought I injured him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you not conciliate him through his wife&mdash;whom you resigned to
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is dead,&mdash;died before he left the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that is unlucky! Still I think an advertisement might do good. Allow
      me to reflect on that subject. Shall we now join Madame la Marquise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      On re-entering the drawing-room, the gentlemen found Beatrice in full
      dress, seated by the fire, and reading so intently that she did not remark
      them enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What so interests you, ma seuur?&mdash;the last novel by Balzac, no
      doubt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice started, and, looking up, showed eyes that were full of tears.
      "Oh, no! no picture of miserable, vicious, Parisian life. This is
      beautiful; there is soul here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal took up the book which the marchesa laid down; it was the same
      which had charmed the circle at Hazeldean, charmed the innocent and
      fresh-hearted, charmed now the wearied and tempted votaress of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum," murmured Randal; "the parson was right. This is power,&mdash;a sort
      of a power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I should like to know the author! Who can he be? Can you guess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I. Some old pedant in spectacles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not, I am sure not. Here beats a heart I have ever sighed to
      find, and never found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, la naive enfant!" cried the count; "comme son imagination s'egare en
      reves enchantes. And to think that while you talk like an Arcadian, you
      are dressed like a princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I forgot&mdash;the Austrian ambassador's. I shall not go to-night.
      This book unfits me for the artificial world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you will, my sister. I shall go. I dislike the man, and he me;
      but ceremonies before men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to the Austrian Embassy?" said Randal. "I, too, shall be
      there. We shall meet." And he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like your young friend prodigiously," said the count, yawning. "I am
      sure that he knows of the lost birds, and will stand to them like a
      pointer, if I can but make it his interest to do so. We shall see."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal arrived at the ambassador's before the count, and contrived to mix
      with the young noblemen attached to the embassy, and to whom he was known.
      Standing among these was a young Austrian, on his travels, of very high
      birth, and with an air of noble grace that suited the ideal of the old
      German chivalry. Randal was presented to him, and, after some talk on
      general topics, observed, "By the way, Prince, there is now in London a
      countryman of yours, with whom you are, doubtless, familiarly acquainted,&mdash;the
      Count di Peschiera."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is no countryman of mine. He is an Italian. I know him but by sight
      and by name," said the prince, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is of very ancient birth, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unquestionably. His ancestors were gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And very rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! I have understood the contrary. He enjoys, it is true, a large
      revenue."
    </p>
    <p>
      A young attache, less discreet than the prince; here observed, "Oh,
      Peschiera! poor fellow, he is too fond of play to be rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there is some chance that the kinsman whose revenue he holds may
      obtain his pardon, and re-enter into possession of his fortunes&mdash;so I
      hear, at least," said Randal, artfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be glad if it be true," said the prince, with decision; "and I
      speak the common sentiment at Vienna. That kinsman had a noble spirit, and
      was, I believe, equally duped and betrayed. Pardon me, sir; but we
      Austrians are not so bad as we are painted. Have you ever met in England
      the kinsman you speak of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, though he is supposed to reside here; and the count tells me that
      he has a daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The count&mdash;ha! I heard something of a scheme,&mdash;a wager of that&mdash;that
      count's. A daughter! Poor girl! I hope she will escape his pursuit; for,
      no doubt, he pursues her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly she may already have married an Englishman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust not," said the prince, seriously; "that might at present be a
      serious obstacle to her father's return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There can be no doubt of it," interposed the attache, with a grand and
      positive air; "unless, indeed, the Englishman were of a rank equal to her
      own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a slight, well-bred murmur and buzz at the door, for the
      Count di Peschiera himself was announced; and as he entered, his presence
      was so striking, and his beauty so dazzling, that whatever there might be
      to the prejudice of his character, it seemed instantly effaced or
      forgotten in that irresistible admiration which it is the prerogative of
      personal attributes alone to create.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince, with a slight curve of his lip at the groups that collected
      round the count, turned to Randal, and said, "Can you tell me if a
      distinguished countryman of yours is in England, Lord L'Estrange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Prince, he is not. You know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is acquainted with the count's kinsman; and perhaps from him you have
      learned to think so highly of that kinsman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince bowed, and answered as he moved away, "When one man of high
      honour vouches for another, he commands the belief of all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," soliloquized Randal, "I must not be precipitate. I was very
      near falling into a terrible trap. If I were to marry the girl, and only,
      by so doing, settle away her inheritance on Peschiera!&mdash;how hard it
      is to be sufficiently cautious in this world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus meditating, a member of parliament tapped him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Melancholy, Leslie! I lay a wager I guess your thoughts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess," answered Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were thinking of the place you are so soon to lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon to lose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, if ministers go out, you could hardly keep it, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      This ominous and horrid member of parliament, Squire Hazeldean's favourite
      county member, Sir John, was one of those legislators especially odious to
      officials,&mdash;an independent "large-acred" member, who would no more
      take office himself than he would cut down the oaks in his park, and who
      had no bowels of human feeling for those who had opposite tastes and less
      magnificent means.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hem!" said Randal, rather surlily. "In the first place, Sir John,
      ministers are not going out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, they will go. You know I vote with them generally, and would
      willingly keep them in; but they are men of honour and spirit; and if they
      can't carry their measures, they must resign; otherwise, by Jove, I would
      turn round and vote them out myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt you would, Sir John; you are quite capable of it; that
      rests with you and your constituents. But even if ministers did go out, I
      am but a poor subaltern in a public office,&mdash;I am no minister. Why
      should I go out too?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Hang it, Leslie, you are laughing at me. A young fellow like you
      could never be mean enough to stay in, under the very men who drove out
      your friend Egerton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not usual for those in the public offices to retire with every
      change of government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not; but always those who are the relations of a retiring
      minister; always those who have been regarded as politicians, and who mean
      to enter parliament, as of course you will do at the next election. But
      you know that as well as I do,&mdash;you who are so decided a politician,
      the writer of that admirable pamphlet! I should not like to tell my friend
      Hazeldean, who has a sincere interest in you, that you ever doubted on a
      question of honour as plain as your A, B, C."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, Sir John," said Randal, recovering his suavity, while he inly
      breathed a dire anathema on his county member, "I am so new to these
      things that what you say never struck me before. No doubt you must be
      right; at all events I cannot have a better guide and adviser than Mr.
      Egerton himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN.&mdash;"No, certainly; perfect gentleman, Egerton! I wish we
      could make it up with him and Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (sighing).&mdash;"Ah, I wish we could!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR JOHN.&mdash;"And some chance of it now; for the time is coming when
      all true men of the old school must stick together."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Wisely, admirably said, my dear Sir John. But, pardon me, I
      must pay my respects to the ambassador." Randal escaped, and passing on,
      saw the ambassador himself in the next room, conferring in a corner with
      Audley Egerton. The ambassador seemed very grave, Egerton calm and
      impenetrable, as usual. Presently the count passed by, and the ambassador
      bowed to him very stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Randal, some time later, was searching for his cloak below, Audley
      Egerton unexpectedly joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Leslie," said the minister, with more kindness than usual, "if you
      don't think the night air too cold for you, let us walk home together. I
      have sent away the carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      This condescension in his patron was so singular, that it quite startled
      Randal, and gave him a presentiment of some evil. When they were in the
      street, Egerton, after a pause, began,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Leslie, it was my hope and belief that I had provided for you
      at least a competence; and that I might open to you, later, a career yet
      more brilliant. Hush! I don't doubt your gratitude; let me proceed. There
      is a possible chance, after certain decisions that the Government have
      come to, that we may be beaten in the House of Commons, and of course
      resign. I tell you this beforehand, for I wish you to have time to
      consider what, in that case, would be your best course. My power of
      serving you may then probably be over. It would, no doubt (seeing our
      close connection, and my views with regard to your future being so well
      known),&mdash;no doubt, he expected that you should give up the place you
      hold, and follow my fortunes for good or ill. But as I have no personal
      enemies with the opposite party, and as I have sufficient position in the
      world to uphold and sanction your choice, whatever it may be, if you think
      it more prudent to retain your place, tell me so openly, and I think I can
      contrive that you may do it without loss of character and credit. In that
      case, confine your ambition merely to rising gradually in your office,
      without mixing in politics. If, on the other hand, you should prefer to
      take your chance of my return to office, and so resign your present place;
      and, furthermore, should commit yourself to a policy that may then be not
      only in opposition but unpopular, I will do my best to introduce you into
      parliamentary life. I cannot say that I advise the latter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal felt as a man feels after a severe fall,&mdash;he was literally
      stunned. At length he faltered out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you think, sir, that I should ever desert your fortunes, your party,
      your cause?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Leslie," replied the minister, "you are too young to have
      committed yourself to any men or to any party, except, indeed, in that
      unlucky pamphlet. This must not be an affair of sentiment, but of sense
      and reflection. Let us say no more on the point now; but by considering
      the pros and the cons, you can better judge what to do, should the time
      for option suddenly arrive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I hope that time may not come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so too, and most sincerely," said the minister, with deliberate
      and genuine emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could be so bad for the country?" ejaculated Pandal. "It does not
      seem to me possible, in the nature of things, that you and your party
      should ever go out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when we are once out, there will be plenty of wiseacres to say it is
      out of the nature of things that we should ever come in again. Here we are
      at the door."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal passed a sleepless night; but, indeed, he was one of those persons
      who neither need, nor are accustomed to, much sleep. However, towards
      morning, when dreams are said to be prophetic, he fell into a most
      delightful slumber, a slumber peopled by visions fitted to lure on,
      through labyrinths of law, predestined chancellors, or wreck upon the
      rocks of glory the inebriate souls of youthful ensigns; dreams from which
      Rood Hall emerged crowned with the towers of Belvoir or Raby, and looking
      over subject lands and manors wrested from the nefarious usurpation of
      Thornhills and Hazeldeans; dreams in which Audley Egerton's gold and
      power, rooms in Downing Street, and saloons in Grosvenor Square, had
      passed away to the smiling dreamer, as the empire of Chaldaea passed to
      Darius the Median. Why visions so belying the gloomy and anxious thoughts
      that preceded them should visit the pillow of Randal Leslie, surpasses my
      philosophy to conjecture. He yielded, however, passively to their spell,
      and was startled to hear the clock strike eleven as he descended the
      stairs to breakfast. He was vexed at the lateness of the hour, for he had
      meant to have taken advantage of the unwonted softness of Egerton, and
      drawn therefrom some promises or proffers to cheer the prospects which the
      minister had so chillingly expanded before him the preceding night; and it
      was only at breakfast that he usually found the opportunity of private
      conference with his busy patron. But Audley Egerton would be sure to have
      sallied forth; and so he had, only Randal was surprised to hear that he
      had gone out in his carriage, instead of on foot, as was his habit. Randal
      soon despatched his solitary meal, and with a new and sudden affection for
      his office, thitherwards bent his way. As he passed through Piccadilly, he
      heard behind a voice that had lately become familiar to him, and turning
      round, saw Baron Levy walking side by side, though not arm-in-arm, with a
      gentleman almost as smart as himself, but with a jauntier step and a
      brisker air,&mdash;a step that, like Diomed's, as described by Shakspeare,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "Rises on the toe; that spirit of his
        In aspiration lifts him from the earth."
</pre>
    <p>
      Indeed, one may judge of the spirits and disposition of a man by his
      ordinary gait and mien in walking. He who habitually pursues abstract
      thought looks down on the ground. He who is accustomed to sudden impulses,
      or is trying to seize upon some necessary recollection, looks up with a
      kind of jerk. He who is a steady, cautious, merely practical man, walks on
      deliberately, his eyes straight before him; and, even in his most musing
      moods, observes things around sufficiently to avoid a porter's knot or a
      butcher's tray. But the man with strong ganglions&mdash;of pushing, lively
      temperament, who, though practical, is yet speculative; the man who is
      emulous and active, and ever trying to rise in life; sanguine, alert, bold&mdash;walks
      with a spring, looks rather above the heads of his fellow-passengers, but
      with a quick, easy turn of his own, which is lightly set on his shoulders;
      his mouth is a little open, his eye is bright, rather restless, but
      penetrative, his port has something of defiance, his form is erect, but
      without stiffness. Such was the appearance of the baron's companion. And
      as Randal turned round at Levy's voice, the baron said to his companion,
      "A young man in the first circles&mdash;you should book him for your fair
      lady's parties. How d' ye do, Mr. Leslie? Let me introduce you to Mr.
      Richard Avenel." Then, as he hooked his arm into Randal's, he whispered,
      "Man of first-rate talent, monstrous rich, has two or three parliamentary
      seats in his pocket, wife gives parties,&mdash;her foible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proud to make your acquaintance, sir," said Mr. Avenel, lifting his hat.
      "Fine day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather cold too," said Leslie, who, like all thin persons with weak
      digestions, was chilly by temperament; besides, he had enough on his mind
      to chill his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the healthier,&mdash;braces the nerves," said Mr. Avenel; "but
      you young fellows relax the system by hot rooms and late hours. Fond of
      dancing, of course, sir?" Then, without waiting for Randal's negative, Mr.
      Richard continued rapidly, "Mrs. Avenel has a soiree dansante on Thursday,&mdash;shall
      be very happy to see you in Eaton Square. Stop, I have a card;" and he
      drew out a dozen large invitation-cards, from which he selected one, and
      presented it to Randal. The baron pressed that young gentleman's arm, and
      Randal replied courteously that it would give him great pleasure to be
      introduced to Mrs. Avenel. Then, as he was not desirous to be seen under
      the wing of Baron Levy, like a pigeon under that of a hawk, he gently
      extricated himself, and pleading great haste, walked quickly on towards
      his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That young man will make a figure some day," said the baron. "I don't
      know any one of his age with so few prejudices. He is a connection by
      marriage to Audley Egerton, who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Audley Egerton!" exclaimed Mr. Avenel; "a d&mdash;-d haughty,
      aristocratic, disagreeable, ungrateful fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what do you know of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He owed his first seat in parliament to the votes of two near relations
      of mine, and when I called upon him some time ago, in his office, he
      absolutely ordered me out of the room. Hang his impertinence; if ever I
      can pay him off, I guess I sha'n't fail for want of good will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ordered you out of the room? That's not like Egerton, who is civil, if
      formal,&mdash;at least to most men. You must have offended him in his weak
      point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man whom the public pays so handsomely should have no weak point. What
      is Egerton's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he values himself on being a thorough gentleman,&mdash;a man of the
      nicest honour," said Levy, with a sneer. "You must have ruffled his plumes
      there. How was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forget," answered Mr. Avenel, who was far too well versed in the London
      scale of human dignities since his marriage, not to look back with a blush
      at his desire of knighthood. "No use bothering our heads now about the
      plumes of an arrogant popinjay. To return to the subject we were
      discussing: you must be sure to let me have this money next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rely on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you'll not let my bills get into the market; keep them under lock and
      key."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we agreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is but a temporary difficulty,&mdash;royal mourning, such nonsense;
      panic in trade, lest these precious ministers go out. I shall soon float
      over the troubled waters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the help of a paper boat," said the baron, laughing; and the two
      gentlemen shook hands and parted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Audley Egerton's carriage had deposited him at the door of Lord
      Lansmere's house, at Knightsbridge. He asked for the countess, and was
      shown into the drawing-room, which was deserted. Egerton was paler than
      usual; and as the door opened, he wiped the unwonted moisture from his
      forehead, and there was a quiver on his firm lip. The countess too, on
      entering, showed an emotion almost equally unusual to her self-control.
      She pressed Audley's hand in silence, and seating herself by his side,
      seemed to collect her thoughts. At length she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rarely indeed that we meet, Mr. Egerton, in spite of your intimacy
      with Lansmere and Harley. I go so little into your world, and you will not
      voluntarily come to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," replied Egerton, "I might evade your kind reproach by stating
      that my hours are not at my disposal; but I answer you with plain truth,&mdash;it
      must be painful to both of us to meet."
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess coloured and sighed, but did not dispute the assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley resumed: "And therefore, I presume that, in sending for me, you
      have something of moment to communicate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It relates to Harley," said the countess, as if in apology; "and I would
      take your advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Harley! Speak on, I beseech you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son has probably told you that he has educated and reared a young
      girl, with the intention to make her Lady L'Estrange, and hereafter
      Countess of Lansmere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley has no secrets from me," said Egerton, mournfully. "This young
      lady has arrived in England, is here, in this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Harley too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she came over with Lady N&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and her daughters.
      Harley was to follow shortly, and I expect him daily. Here is his letter.
      Observe, he has never yet communicated his intentions to this young
      person, now entrusted to my care, never spoken to her as the lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton took the letter and read it rapidly, though with attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said he, as he returned the letter: "and before he does so he
      wishes you to see Miss Digby and to judge of her yourself,&mdash;wishes to
      know if you will approve and sanction his choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is on this that I would consult you: a girl without rank; the father,
      it is true, a gentleman, though almost equivocally one, but the mother, I
      know not what. And Harley, for whom I hoped an alliance with the first
      houses in England!" The countess pressed her hands convulsively together.
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"He is no more a boy. His talents have been wasted, his
      life a wanderer's. He presents to you a chance of resettling his mind, of
      re-arousing his native powers, of a home besides your own. Lady Lansmere,
      you cannot hesitate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY LANSMERE.&mdash;"I do, I do? After all that I have hoped after all
      that I did to prevent&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (interrupting her).&mdash;"You owe him now an atonement; that is
      in your power,&mdash;it is not in mine." The countess again pressed
      Audley's hand, and the tears gushed from her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be so. I consent, I consent. I will silence, I will crush back
      this proud heart. Alas! it well-nigh broke his own! I am glad you speak
      thus. I like to think he owes my consent to you. In that there is
      atonement for both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too generous, madam," said Egerton, evidently moved, though
      still, as ever, striving to repress emotion. "And now may I see the young
      lady? This conference pains me; you see even my strong nerves quiver; and
      at this time I have much to go through,&mdash;need of all my strength and
      firmness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear, indeed, that the Government will probably retire. But it is with
      honour: it will be soon called back by the voice of the nation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see the future wife of Harley L'Estrange," said Egerton, without
      heed of this consolatory exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess rose and left the room. In a few minutes she returned with
      Helen Digby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was wondrously improved from the pale, delicate child, with the soft
      smile and intelligent eyes, who had sat by the side of Leonard in his
      garret. She was about the middle height, still slight, but beautifully
      formed; that exquisite roundness of proportion which conveys so well the
      idea of woman, in its undulating, pliant grace,&mdash;formed to embellish
      life, and soften away its rude angles; formed to embellish, not to
      protect. Her face might not have satisfied the critical eye of an artist,&mdash;it
      was not without defects in regularity; but its expression was eminently
      gentle and prepossessing; and there were few who would not have exclaimed,
      "What a lovely countenance!" The mildness of her brow was touched with
      melancholy&mdash;her childhood had left its traces on her youth. Her step
      was slow, and her manner shy, subdued, and timid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley gazed on her with earnestness as she approached him; and then
      coming forward, took her hand and kissed it. "I am your guardian's
      constant friend," said he, and he drew her gently to a seat beside him, in
      the recess of a window. With a quick glance of his eye towards the
      countess, he seemed to imply the wish to converse with Helen somewhat
      apart. So the countess interpreted the glance; and though she remained in
      the room, she seated herself at a distance, and bent over a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was touching to see how the austere man of business lent himself to
      draw forth the mind of this quiet, shrinking girl; and if you had
      listened, you would have comprehended how he came to possess such social
      influence, and how well, some time or other in the course of his life, he
      had learned to adapt himself to women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke first of Harley L'Estrange,&mdash;spoke with tact and delicacy.
      Helen at first answered by monosyllables, and then, by degrees, with
      grateful and open affection. Audley's brow grew shaded. He then spoke of
      Italy; and though no man had less of the poet in his nature, yet with the
      dexterity of one long versed in the world, and who had been accustomed to
      extract evidences from characters most opposed to his own, he suggested
      such topics as might serve to arouse poetry in others. Helen's replies
      betrayed a cultivated taste, and a charming womanly mind; but they
      betrayed, also, one accustomed to take its colourings from another's,&mdash;to
      appreciate, admire, revere the Lofty and the Beautiful, but humbly and
      meekly. There was no vivid enthusiasm, no remark of striking originality,
      no flash of the self-kindling, creative faculty. Lastly, Egerton turned to
      England,&mdash;to the critical nature of the times, to the claims which
      the country possessed upon all who had the ability to serve and guide its
      troubled destinies. He enlarged warmly on Harley's natural talents, and
      rejoiced that he had returned to England, perhaps to commence some great
      career. Helen looked surprised, but her face caught no correspondent glow
      from Audley's eloquence. He rose, and an expression of disappointment
      passed over his grave, handsome features, and as quickly vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, my dear Miss Digby; I fear I have wearied you, especially with my
      politics. Adieu, Lady Lansmere; no doubt I shall see Harley as soon as he
      returns."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he hastened from the room, gained his carriage, and ordered the
      coachman to drive to Downing Street. He drew down the blinds, and leaned
      back. A certain languor became visible in his face, and once or twice, he
      mechanically put his hand to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is good, amiable, docile,&mdash;will make an excellent wife, no
      doubt," said he, murmuringly. "But does she love Harley as he has dreamed
      of love? No! Has she the power and energy to arouse his faculties, and
      restore to the world the Harley of old? No! Meant by Heaven to be the
      shadow of another's sun&mdash;not herself the sun,&mdash;this child is not
      the one who can atone for the Past and illume the Future."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That evening Harley L'Estrange arrived at his father's house. The few
      years that had passed since we saw him last had made no perceptible change
      in his appearance. He still preserved his elastic youthfulness of form,
      and singular variety and play of countenance. He seemed unaffectedly
      rejoiced to greet his parents, and had something of the gayety and
      tenderness of a boy returned from school. His manner to Helen bespoke the
      chivalry that pervaded all the complexities and curves of his character.
      It was affectionate, but respectful,&mdash;hers to him, subdued, but
      innocently sweet and gently cordial. Harley was the chief talker. The
      aspect of the times was so critical that he could not avoid questions on
      politics; and, indeed, he showed an interest in them which he had never
      evinced before. Lord Lansmere was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Harley, you love your country after all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The moment she seems in danger, yes!" replied the Patrician; and the
      Sybarite seemed to rise into the Athenian. Then he asked with eagerness
      about his old friend Audley; and, his curiosity satisfied there, he
      inquired the last literary news. He had heard much of a book lately
      published. He named the one ascribed by Parson Dale to Professor Moss;
      none of his listeners had read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley pished at this, and accused them all of indolence and stupidity, in
      his own quaint, metaphorical style. Then he said, "And town gossip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We never hear it," said Lady Lansmere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a new plough much talked of at Boodle's," said Lord Lansmere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God speed it. But is not there a new man much talked of at White's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't belong to White's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless, you may have heard of him,&mdash;a foreigner, a Count di
      Peschiera."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lord Lansmere; "he was pointed out to me in the Park,&mdash;a
      handsome man for a foreigner; wears his hair properly cut; looks
      gentlemanlike and English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah! He is here then!" and Harley rubbed his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which road did you take? Did you pass the Simplon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I came straight from Vienna."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, relating with lively vein his adventures by the way, he continued to
      delight Lord Lansmere by his gayety till the time came to retire to rest.
      As soon as Harley was in his own room his mother joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, "I need not ask if you like Miss Digby? Who would not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley, my own son," said the mother, bursting into tears, "be happy your
      own way; only be happy, that is all I ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley, much affected, replied gratefully and soothingly to this fond
      injunction. And then gradually leading his mother on to converse of Helen,
      asked abruptly, "And of the chance of our happiness,&mdash;her happiness
      as well as mine,&mdash;what is your opinion? Speak frankly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of her happiness there can be no doubt," replied the mother, proudly. "Of
      yours, how can you ask me? Have you not decided on that yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But still it cheers and encourages one in any experiment, however well
      considered, to hear the approval of another. Helen has certainly a most
      gentle temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should conjecture so. But her mind&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is very well stored."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She speaks so little&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I wonder why? She's surely a woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw," said the countess, smiling in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But tell me more of the process of your experiment. You took her as a
      child, and resolved to train her according to your own ideal. Was that
      easy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seemed so. I desired to instil habits of truth: she was already by
      nature truthful as the day; a taste for Nature and all things natural:
      that seemed inborn; perceptions of Art as the interpreter of Nature: those
      were more difficult to teach. I think they may come. You have heard her
      play and sing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "NO."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will surprise you. She has less talent for drawing; still, all that
      teaching could do has been done,&mdash;in a word, she is accomplished.
      Temper, heart, mind,&mdash;these all are excellent." Harley stopped, and
      suppressed a sigh. "Certainly I ought to be very happy," said he; and he
      began to wind up his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course she must love you," said the countess, after a pause. "How
      could she fail?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love me! My dear mother, that is the very question I shall have to ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask! Love is discovered by a glance; it has no need of asking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never discovered it, then, I assure you. The fact is, that before
      her childhood was passed, I removed her, as you may suppose, from my roof.
      She resided with an Italian family near my usual abode. I visited her
      often, directed her studies, watched her improvement&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And fell in love with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fall is such a very violent word. No; I don't remember to have had a
      fall. It was all a smooth inclined plane from the first step, until at
      last I said to myself, 'Harley L'Estrange, thy time has come. The bud has
      blossomed into flower. Take it to thy breast.' And myself replied to
      myself, meekly, 'So be it.' Then I found that Lady N&mdash;&mdash;-, with
      her daughters, was coming to England. I asked her Ladyship to take my ward
      to your house. I wrote to you, and prayed your assent; and, that granted,
      I knew you would obtain my father's. Iam here,&mdash;you give me the
      approval I sought for. I will speak to Helen to-morrow. Perhaps, after
      all, she may reject me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange, strange! you speak thus coldly, thus lightly, you, so capable of
      ardent love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said Harley, earnestly, "be satisfied! I am! Love as of old, I
      feel, alas! too well, can visit me never more. But gentle companionship,
      tender friendship, the relief and the sunlight of woman's smile, hereafter
      the voices of children,&mdash;music that, striking on the hearts of both
      parents, wakens the most lasting and the purest of all sympathies,&mdash;these
      are my hope. Is the hope so mean, my fond mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the countess wept, and her tears were not dried when she left the
      room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oh, Helen, fair Helen,&mdash;type of the quiet, serene, unnoticed,
      deep-felt excellence of woman! Woman, less as the ideal that a poet
      conjures from the air, than as the companion of a poet on the earth!
      Woman, who, with her clear sunny vision of things actual, and the
      exquisite fibre of her delicate sense, supplies the deficiencies of him
      whose foot stumbles on the soil, because his eye is too intent upon the
      stars! Woman, the provident, the comforting, angel whose pinions are
      folded round the heart, guarding there a divine spring unmarred by the
      winter of the world! Helen, soft Helen, is it indeed in thee that the wild
      and brilliant "lord of wantonness and ease" is to find the regeneration of
      his life, the rebaptism of his soul? Of what avail thy meek prudent
      household virtues to one whom Fortune screens from rough trial; whose
      sorrows lie remote from thy ken; whose spirit, erratic and perturbed, now
      rising, now falling, needs a vision more subtle than thine to pursue, and
      a strength that can sustain the reason, when it droops, on the wings of
      enthusiasm and passion?
    </p>
    <p>
      And thou, thyself, O nature, shrinking and humble, that needest to be
      courted forth from the shelter, and developed under the calm and genial
      atmosphere of holy, happy love&mdash;can such affection as Harley
      L'Estrange may proffer suffice to thee? Will not the blossoms, yet folded
      in the petal, wither away beneath the shade that may protect them from the
      storm, and yet shut them from the sun? Thou who, where thou givest love,
      seekest, though meekly, for love in return; to be the soul's sweet
      necessity, the life's household partner to him who receives all thy faith
      and devotion,&mdash;canst thou influence the sources of joy and of sorrow
      in the heart that does not heave at thy name? Hast thou the charm and the
      force of the moon, that the tides of that wayward sea shall ebb and flow
      at thy will? Yet who shall say, who conjecture how near two hearts can
      become, when no guilt lies between them, and time brings the ties all its
      own? Rarest of all things on earth is the union in which both, by their
      contrasts, make harmonious their blending; each supplying the defects of
      the helpmate, and completing, by fusion, one strong human soul! Happiness
      enough, where even Peace does but seldom preside, when each can bring to
      the altar, if not the flame, still the incense. Where man's thoughts are
      all noble and generous, woman's feelings all gentle and pure, love may
      follow if it does not precede; and if not, if the roses be missed from the
      garland, one may sigh for the rose, but one is safe from the thorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was mild, yet somewhat overcast by the mist which announces
      coming winter in London, and Helen walked musingly beneath the trees that
      surrounded the garden of Lord Lansmere's house. Many leaves were yet left
      on the boughs; but they were sere and withered. And the birds chirped at
      times; but their note was mournful and complaining. All within this house,
      until Harley's arrival, had been strange and saddening to Helen's timid
      and subdued spirits. Lady Lansmere had received her kindly, but with a
      certain restraint; and the loftiness of manner, common to the countess
      with all but Harley, had awed and chilled the diffident orphan. Lady
      Lansmere's very interest in Harley's choice, her attempts to draw Helen
      out of her reserve, her watchful eyes whenever Helen shyly spoke or shyly
      moved, frightened the poor child, and made her unjust to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very servants, though staid, grave, and respectful, as suited a
      dignified, old-fashioned household, painfully contrasted the bright
      welcoming smiles and free talk of Italian domestics. Her recollections of
      the happy, warm Continental manner, which so sets the bashful at their
      ease, made the stately and cold precision of all around her doubly awful
      and dispiriting. Lord Lansmere himself, who did not as yet know the views
      of Harley, and little dreamed that he was to anticipate a daughter-in-law
      in the ward, whom he understood Harley, in a freak of generous romance,
      had adopted, was familiar and courteous, as became a host; but he looked
      upon Helen as a mere child, and naturally left her to the countess. The
      dim sense of her equivocal position, of her comparative humbleness of
      birth and fortunes, oppressed and pained her; and even her gratitude to
      Harley was made burdensome by a sentiment of helplessness. The grateful
      long to requite. And what could she ever do for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus musing, she wandered alone through the curving walks; and this sort
      of mock-country landscape&mdash;London loud, and even visible, beyond the
      high gloomy walls, and no escape from the windows of the square formal
      house&mdash;seemed a type of the prison bounds of Rank to one whose soul
      yearns for simple loving Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen's revery was interrupted by Nero's joyous bark. He had caught sight
      of her, and came bounding up, and thrust his large head into her hand. As
      she stooped to caress the dog, happy at his honest greeting, and tears
      that had been long gathering at the lids fell silently on his face (for I
      know nothing that more moves us to tears than the hearty kindness of a
      dog, when something in human beings has pained or chilled us), she heard
      behind the musical voice of Harley. Hastily she dried or repressed her
      tears, as her guardian came up, and drew her arm within his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had so little of your conversation last evening, my dear ward, that I
      may well monopolize you now, even to the privation of Nero. And so you are
      once more in your native land?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen sighed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I not hope that you return under fairer auspices than those which
      your childhood knew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen turned her eyes with ingenuous thankfulness to her guardian, and the
      memory of all she owed to him rushed upon her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley renewed, and with earnest, though melancholy sweetness, "Helen,
      your eyes thank me; but hear me before your words do. I deserve no thanks.
      I am about to make to you a strange confession of egotism and
      selfishness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!&mdash;oh, impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judge yourself, and then decide which of us shall have cause to be
      grateful. Helen, when I was scarcely your age&mdash;a boy in years, but
      more, methinks, a man at heart, with man's strong energies and sublime
      aspirings, than I have ever since been&mdash;I loved, and deeply&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, in evident struggle. Helen listened in mute surprise,
      but his emotion awakened her own; her tender woman's heart yearned to
      console. Unconsciously her arm rested on his less lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deeply, and for sorrow. It is a long tale, that may be told hereafter.
      The worldly would call my love a madness. I did not reason on it then, I
      cannot reason on it now. Enough: death smote suddenly, terribly, and to
      me, mysteriously, her whom I loved. The love lived on. Fortunately,
      perhaps, for me, I had quick distraction, not to grief, but to its inert
      indulgence. I was a soldier; I joined our armies. Men called me brave.
      Flattery! I was a coward before the thought of life. I sought death: like
      sleep, it does not come at our call. Peace ensued. As when the winds fall
      the sails droop, so when excitement ceased, all seemed to me flat and
      objectless. Heavy, heavy was my heart. Perhaps grief had been less
      obstinate, but that I feared I had causes for self-reproach. Since then I
      have been a wanderer, a self-made exile. My boyhood had been ambitious,&mdash;all
      ambition ceased. Flames, when they reach the core of the heart, spread,
      and leave all in ashes. Let me be brief: I did not mean thus weakly to
      complain,&mdash;I to whom Heaven has given so many blessings! I felt, as
      it were, separated from the common objects and joys of men. I grew
      startled to see how, year by year, wayward humours possessed me. I
      resolved again to attach myself to some living heart&mdash;it was my sole
      chance to rekindle my own. But the one I had loved remained as my type of
      woman, and she was different from all I saw. Therefore I said to myself,
      'I will rear from childhood some young fresh life, to grow up into my
      ideal.' As this thought began to haunt me, I chanced to discover you.
      Struck with the romance of your early life, touched by your courage,
      charmed by your affectionate nature, I said to myself, 'Here is what I
      seek.' Helen, in assuming the guardianship of your 'Life, in all the
      culture which I have sought to bestow on your docile childhood, I repeat,
      that I have been but the egotist. And now, when you have reached that age
      when it becomes me to speak, and you to listen; now, when you are under
      the sacred roof of my own mother; now I ask you, can you accept this
      heart, such as wasted years, and griefs too fondly nursed, have left it?
      Can you be, at least, my comforter? Can you aid me to regard life as a
      duty, and recover those aspirations which once soared from the paltry and
      miserable confines of our frivolous daily being? Helen, here I ask you,
      can you be all this, and under the name of&mdash;Wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be in vain to describe the rapid, varying, indefinable emotions
      that passed through the inexperienced heart of the youthful listener as
      Harley thus spoke. He so moved all the springs of amaze, compassion,
      tender respect, sympathy, child-like gratitude, that when he paused and
      gently took her hand, she remained bewildered, speechless, overpowered.
      Harley smiled as he gazed upon her blushing, downcast, expressive face. He
      conjectured at once that the idea of such proposals had never crossed her
      mind; that she had never contemplated him in the character of wooer; never
      even sounded her heart as to the nature of such feelings as his image had
      aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Helen," he resumed, with a calm pathos of voice, "there is some
      disparity of years between us, and perhaps I may not hope henceforth for
      that love which youth gives to the young. Permit me simply to ask, what
      you will frankly answer, Can you have seen in our quiet life abroad, or
      under the roof of your Italian friends, any one you prefer to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, no!" murmured Helen. "How could I; who is like you?" Then,
      with a sudden effort&mdash;for her innate truthfulness took alarm, and her
      very affection for Harley, childlike and reverent, made her tremble lest
      she should deceive him&mdash;she drew a little aside, and spoke thus,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear guardian, noblest of all human beings, at least in my eyes,
      forgive, forgive me, if I seem ungrateful, hesitating; but I cannot,
      cannot think of myself as worthy of you. I never so lifted my eyes. Your
      rank, your position&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should they be eternally my curse? Forget them, and go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not only they," said Helen, almost sobbing, "though they are much;
      but I your type, your ideal!&mdash;I?&mdash;impossible! Oh, how can I ever
      be anything even of use, of aid, of comfort to one like you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can, Helen&mdash;you can," cried Harley, charmed by such ingenuous
      modesty. "May I not keep this hand?" And Helen left her hand in Harley's,
      and turned away her face, fairly weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stately step passed under the wintry trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother," said Harley L'Estrange, looking up, "I present to you my
      future wife."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      With a slow step and an abstracted air, Harley L'Estrange bent his way
      towards Egerton's house, after his eventful interview with Helen. He had
      just entered one of the streets leading into Grosvenor Square, when a
      young man, walking quickly from the opposite direction, came full against
      him, and drawing back with a brief apology, recognized him, and exclaimed,
      "What! you in England, Lord L'Estrange! Accept my congratulations on your
      return. But you seem scarcely to remember me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Mr. Leslie. I remember you now by your smile; but you
      are of an age in which it is permitted me to say that you look older than
      when I saw you last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet, Lord L'Estrange, it seems to me that you look younger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, this reply was so far true that there appeared less difference of
      years than before between Leslie and L'Estrange; for the wrinkles in the
      schemer's mind were visible in his visage, while Harley's dreamy worship
      of Truth and Beauty seemed to have preserved to the votary the enduring
      youth of the divinities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley received the compliment with a supreme indifference, which might
      have been suitable to a Stoic, but which seemed scarcely natural to a
      gentleman who had just proposed to a lady many years younger than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie renewed: "Perhaps you are on your way to Mr. Egerton's. If so, you
      will not find him at home; he is at his office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you. Then to his office I must re-direct my steps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to him myself," said Randal, hesitatingly. L'Estrange had no
      prepossessions in favour of Leslie from the little he had seen of that
      young gentleman; but Randal's remark was an appeal to his habitual
      urbanity, and he replied, with well-bred readiness, "Let us be companions
      so far."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal accepted the arm proffered to him; and Lord L'Estrange, as is usual
      with one long absent from his native land, bore part as a questioner in
      the dialogue that ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egerton is always the same man, I suppose,&mdash;too busy for illness,
      and too firm for sorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he ever feel either, he will never stoop to complain. But, indeed, my
      dear lord, I should like much to know what you think of his health."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How! You alarm me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I did not mean to do that; and pray do not let him know that I went
      so far. But I have fancied that he looks a little worn and suffering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Audley!" said L'Estrange, in a tone of deep affection. "I will sound
      him, and, be assured, without naming you; for I know well how little he
      likes to be supposed capable of human infirmity. I am obliged to you for
      your hint, obliged to you for your interest in one so dear to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Harley's voice was more cordial to Randal than it had ever been
      before. He then began to inquire what Randal thought of the rumours that
      had reached himself as to the probable defeat of the Government, and how
      far Audley's spirits were affected by such risks. But Randal here, seeing
      that Harley could communicate nothing, was reserved and guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loss of office could not, I think, affect a man like Audley," observed
      Lord L'Estrange. "He would be as great in opposition&mdash;perhaps
      greater; and as to emoluments&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The emoluments are good," interposed Randal, with a half-sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good enough, I suppose, to pay him back about a tenth of what his place
      costs our magnificent friend. No, I will say one thing for English
      statesmen, no man amongst them ever yet was the richer for place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mr. Egerton's private fortune must be large, I take for granted,"
      said Randal, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to be, if he has time to look to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they passed by the hotel in which lodged the Count di Peschiera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal stopped. "Will you excuse me for an instant? As we are passing this
      hotel, I will just leave my card here." So saying he gave his card to a
      waiter lounging by the door. "For the Count di Peschiera," said he, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      L'Estrange started; and as Randal again took his arm, said, "So that
      Italian lodges here; and you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know him but slightly, as one knows any foreigner who makes a
      sensation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He makes a sensation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally; for he is handsome, witty, and said to be very rich,&mdash;that
      is, as long as he receives the revenues of his exiled kinsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you are well informed, Mr. Leslie. And what is supposed to bring
      hither the Count di Peschiera?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did hear something, which I did not quite understand, about a bet of
      his that he would marry his kinsman's daughter, and so, I conclude, secure
      to himself all the inheritance; and that he is therefore here to discover
      the kinsman and win the heiress. But probably you know the rights of the
      story, and can tell me what credit to give to such gossip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know this at least, that if he did lay such a wager, I would advise you
      to take any odds against him that his backers may give," said L'Estrange,
      dryly; and while his lip quivered with anger, his eye gleamed with arch
      ironical humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think, then, that this poor kinsman will not need such an alliance in
      order to regain his estates?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; for I never yet knew a rogue whom I would not bet against, when he
      backed his own luck as a rogue against Justice and Providence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal winced, and felt as if an arrow had grazed his heart; but he soon
      recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And indeed there is another vague rumour that the young lady in question
      is married already&mdash;to some Englishman." This time it was Harley who
      winced. "Good heavens! that cannot be true,&mdash;that would undo all! An
      Englishman just at this moment! But some Englishman of correspondent rank
      I trust, or at least one known for opinions opposed to what an Austrian
      would call Revolutionary doctrines?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing. But it was supposed merely a private gentleman of good
      family. Would not that suffice? Can the Austrian Court dictate a marriage
      to the daughter as a condition for grace to the father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No,&mdash;not that!" said Harley, greatly disturbed. "But put yourself in
      the position of any minister to one of the great European monarchies.
      Suppose a political insurgent, formidable for station and wealth, had been
      proscribed, much interest made on his behalf, a powerful party striving
      against it; and just when the minister is disposed to relent, he hears
      that the heiress to this wealth and this station is married to the native
      of a country in which sentiments friendly to the very opinions for which
      the insurgent was proscribed are popularly entertained, and thus that the
      fortune to be restored may be so employed as to disturb the national
      security, the existing order of things,&mdash;this, too, at the very time
      when a popular revolution has just occurred in France, and its effects are
      felt most in the very land of the exile;&mdash;suppose all this, and then
      say if anything could be more untoward for the hopes of the banished man,
      or furnish his adversaries with stronger arguments against the restoration
      of his fortune? But pshaw! this must be a chimera! If true, I should have
      known of it."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [As there have been so many revolutions in France, it may be
   convenient to suggest that, according to the dates of this story,
   Harley no doubt alludes to that revolution which exiled Charles X.
   and placed Louis Philippe on the throne.]
</pre>
    <p>
      "I quite agree with your lordship,&mdash;there can be no truth in such a
      rumour. Some Englishman, hearing, perhaps, of the probable pardon of the
      exile, may have counted on an heiress, and spread the report in order to
      keep off other candidates. By your account, if successful in his suit, he
      might fail to find an heiress in the bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of that. Whatever might be arranged, I can't conceive that he
      would be allowed to get at the fortune, though it might be held in
      suspense for his children. But indeed it so rarely happens that an Italian
      girl of high name marries a foreigner that we must dismiss this notion
      with a smile at the long face of the hypothetical fortune-hunter. Heaven
      help him, if he exist!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" echoed Randal, devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear that Peschiera,'s sister is returned to England. Do you know her
      too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Leslie, pardon me if I take a liberty not warranted by our
      acquaintance. Against the lady I say nothing. Indeed, I have heard some
      things which appear to entitle her to compassion and respect. But as to
      Peschiera all who prize honour suspect him to be a knave,&mdash;I know him
      to be one. Now, I think that the longer we preserve that abhorrence for
      knavery which is the generous instinct of youth, why, the fairer will be
      our manhood, and the more reverend our age. You agree with me?" And Harley
      suddenly turning, his eyes fell like a flood of light upon Randal's pale
      and secret countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," murmured the schemer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley, surveying him, mechanically recoiled, and withdrew his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for Randal, who somehow or other felt himself slipped into a
      false position, he scarce knew how or why, he was here seized by the arm;
      and a clear, open, manly voice cried, "My dear fellow, how are you? I see
      you are engaged now; but look into my rooms when you can, in the course of
      the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a bow of excuse for his interruption to Lord L'Estrange, the
      speaker was then turning away, when Harley said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't let me take you from your friend, Mr. Leslie. And you need not
      be in a hurry to see Egerton; for I shall claim the privilege of older
      friendship for the first interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Mr. Egerton's nephew Frank Hazeldan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, call him back, and present me to him. He has a face that would have
      gone far to reconcile Timon to Athens." Randal obeyed, and after a few
      kindly words to Frank, Harley insisted on leaving the two young men
      together, and walked on to Downing Street with a brisker step.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "That Lord L'Estrange seems a very good fellow."
    </h3>
    <p>
      "So-so; an effeminate humourist,&mdash;says the most absurd things, and
      fancies them wise. Never mind him. You wanted to speak to me, Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I am so obliged to you for introducing me to Levy. I must tell you
      how handsomely he has behaved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop; allow me to remind you that I did not introduce you to Levy; you
      had met him before at Borrowell's, if I recollect right, and he dined with
      us at the Clarendon,&mdash;that is all I had to do with bringing you
      together. Indeed I rather cautioned you against him than not. Pray don't
      think I introduced you to a man who, however pleasant and perhaps honest,
      is still a money-lender. Your father would be justly angry with me if I
      had done so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, pooh! you are prejudiced against poor Levy. But just hear: I was
      sitting very ruefully, thinking over those cursed bills, and how the deuce
      I should renew them, when Levy walked into my rooms; and after telling me
      of his long friendship for my uncle Egerton and his admiration for
      yourself, and (give me your hand, Randal) saying how touched he felt by
      your kind sympathy in my troubles, he opened his pocket-book, and showed
      me the bills safe and sound in his own possession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had bought them up. 'It must be so disagreeable to me,' he said, 'to
      have them flying about the London moneymarket, and those Jews would be
      sure sooner or later to apply to my father. And now,' added Levy, 'I am in
      no immediate hurry for the money, and we must put the interest upon fairer
      terms.' In short, nothing could be more liberal than his tone. And he
      says, he is thinking of a way to relieve me altogether, and will call
      about it in a few days, when his plan is matured. After all, I must owe
      this to you, Randal. I dare swear you put it into his head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, indeed! On the contrary, I still say, Be cautious in all your
      dealings with Levy. I don't know, I 'm sure, what he means to propose.
      Have you heard from the Hall lately?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to-day. Only think&mdash;the Riccaboccas have disappeared. My mother
      writes me word of it,&mdash;a very odd letter. She seems to suspect that I
      know where they are, and reproaches me for 'mystery'&mdash;quite
      enigmatical. But there is one sentence in her letter&mdash;see, here it is
      in the postscript&mdash;which seems to refer to Beatrice: 'I don't ask you
      to tell me your secrets, Frank, but Randal will no doubt have assured you
      that my first consideration will be for your own happiness, in any matter
      in which your heart is really engaged.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Randal, slowly; "no doubt this refers to Beatrice; but, as I
      told you, your mother will not interfere one way or the other,&mdash;such
      interference would weaken her influence with the squire. Besides, as she
      said, she can't wish, you to marry a foreigner; though once married, she
      would&mdash;But how do you stand now with the marchesa? Has she consented
      to accept you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite; indeed I have not actually proposed. Her manner, though much
      softened, has not so far emboldened me; and, besides, before a positive
      declaration, I certainly must go down to the Hall and speak at least to my
      mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must judge for yourself, but don't do anything rash: talk first to
      me. Here we are at my office. Good-by; and&mdash;and pray believe that, in
      whatever you do with Levy, I have no hand in it."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Towards the evening, Randal was riding fast on the road to Norwood. The
      arrival of Harley, and the conversation that had passed between that
      nobleman and Randal, made the latter anxious to ascertain how far
      Riccabocca was likely to learn L'Estrange's return to England, and to meet
      with him. For he felt that, should the latter come to know that
      Riccabocca, in his movements, had gone by Randal's advice. Harley would
      find that Randal had spoken to him disingenuously; and on the other hand,
      Riccabocca, placed under the friendly protection of Lord L'Estrange, would
      no longer need Randal Leslie to defend him from the machinations of
      Peschiera. To a reader happily unaccustomed to dive into the deep and mazy
      recesses of a schemer's mind, it might seem that Randal's interest in
      retaining a hold over the exile's confidence would terminate with the
      assurances that had reached him, from more than one quarter, that Violante
      might cease to be an heiress if she married himself. "But perhaps,"
      suggests some candid and youthful conjecturer,&mdash;"perhaps Randal
      Leslie is in love with this fair creature?" Randal in love!&mdash;no! He
      was too absorbed by harder passions for that blissful folly. Nor, if he
      could have fallen in love, was Violante the one to attract that sullen,
      secret heart; her instinctive nobleness, the very stateliness of her
      beauty, womanlike though it was, awed him. Men of that kind may love some
      soft slave,&mdash;they cannot lift their eyes to a queen. They may look
      down,&mdash;they cannot lookup. But on the one hand, Randal could not
      resign altogether the chance of securing a fortune that would realize his
      most dazzling dreams, upon the mere assurance, however probable, which had
      so dismayed him; and on the other hand, should he be compelled to
      relinquish all idea of such alliance, though he did not contemplate the
      base perfidy of actually assisting Peschiera's avowed designs, still, if
      Frank's marriage with Beatrice should absolutely depend upon her brother's
      obtaining the knowledge of Violante's retreat, and that marriage should be
      as conducive to his interests as he thought he could make it, why&mdash;he
      did not then push his deductions further, even to himself,&mdash;they
      seemed too black; but he sighed heavily, and that sigh foreboded how weak
      would be honour and virtue against avarice and ambition. Therefore, on all
      accounts, Riccabocca was one of those cards in a sequence, which so
      calculating a player would not throw out of his hand: it might serve for
      repique, at the worst it might score well in the game. Intimacy with the
      Italian was still part and parcel in that knowledge which was the synonym
      of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the young man was thus meditating, on his road to Norwood,
      Riccabocca and his Jemima were close conferring in their drawing-room. And
      if you could have seen them, reader, you would have been seized with equal
      surprise and curiosity: for some extraordinary communication had certainly
      passed between them. Riccabocca was evidently much agitated, and with
      emotions not familiar to him. The tears stood in his eyes at the same time
      that a smile, the reverse of cynical or sardonic, curved his lips; while
      his wife was leaning her head on his shoulder, her hand clasped in his,
      and, by the expression of her face, you might guess that he had paid her
      some very gratifying compliment, of a nature more genuine and sincere than
      those which characterized his habitual hollow and dissimulating gallantry.
      But just at this moment Giacomo entered, and Jemima, with her native
      English modesty, withdrew in haste from Riccabocca's sheltering side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Padrone," said Giacomo, who, whatever his astonishment at the connubial
      position he had disturbed, was much too discreet to betray it,&mdash;"Padrone,
      I see the young Englishman riding towards the house, and I hope, when he
      arrives, you will not forget the alarming information I gave to you this
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah!" said Riccabocca, his face falling. "If the signorina were but
      married!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My very thought,&mdash;my constant thought!" exclaimed Riccabocca. "And
      you really believe the young Englishman loves her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why else should he come, Excellency?" asked Giacomo, with great naivete.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true; why, indeed?" said Riccabocca. "Jemima, I cannot endure the
      terrors I suffer on that poor child's account. I will open myself frankly
      to Randal Leslie. And now, too, that which might have been a serious
      consideration, in case I return to Italy, will no longer stand in our way,
      Jemima."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jemima smiled faintly, and whispered something to Riccabocca, to which he
      replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, anima mia. I know it will be,&mdash;have not a doubt of it. I
      tell you it is as nine to four, according to the nicest calculations. I
      will speak at once to Randal. He is too young, too timid to speak
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," interposed Giacomo; "how could he dare to speak, let him love
      ever so well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jemima shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never fear," said Riccabocca, observing this gesture; "I will give
      him the trial. If he entertain but mercenary views, I shall soon detect
      them. I know human nature pretty well, I think, my love; and, Giacomo,
      just get me my Machiavelli;&mdash;that's right. Now leave me, my dear; I
      must reflect and prepare myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Randal entered the house, Giacomo, with a smile of peculiar suavity,
      ushered him into the drawing-room. He found Riccabocca alone, and seated
      before the fireplace, leaning his face on his hand, with the great folio
      of Machiavelli lying open on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian received him as courteously as usual; but there was in his
      manner a certain serious and thoughtful dignity, which was perhaps the
      more imposing, because but rarely assumed. After a few preliminary
      observations, Randal remarked that Frank Hazeldean had informed him of the
      curiosity which the disappearance of the Riccaboccas had excited at the
      Hall, and inquired carelessly if the doctor had left instructions as to
      the forwarding of any letters that might be directed to him at the Casino.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Letters!" said Riccabocca, simply; "I never receive any; or, at least, so
      rarely, that it was not worth while to take an event so little to be
      expected into consideration. No; if any letters do reach the Casino, there
      they will wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can see no possibility of indiscretion; no chance of a clew to
      your address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I either."
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied so far, and knowing that it was not in Riecabocca's habits to
      read the newspapers, by which he might otherwise have learned of
      L'Estrange's arrival in London, Randal then proceeded to inquire, with
      much seeming interest, into the health of Violante,&mdash;hoped it did not
      suffer by confinement, etc. Riccabocca eyed him gravely while he spoke,
      and then suddenly rising, that air of dignity to which I have before
      referred became yet more striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My young friend," said he, "hear me attentively, and answer me frankly. I
      know human nature&mdash;" Here a slight smile of proud complacency passed
      the sage's lips, and his eye glanced towards his Machiavelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know human nature,&mdash;at least I have studied it," he renewed more
      earnestly, and with less evident self-conceit; "and I believe that when a
      perfect stranger to me exhibits an interest in my affairs, which occasions
      him no small trouble,&mdash;an interest," continued the wise man, laying
      his hand on Randal's shoulder, "which scarcely a son could exceed, he must
      be under the influence of some strong personal motive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir!" cried Randal, turning a shade more pale, and with a faltering
      tone. Riccabocca, surveyed him with the tenderness of a superior being,
      and pursued his deductive theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your case, what is that motive? Not political; for I conclude you
      share the opinions of your government, and those opinions have not
      favoured mine. Not that of pecuniary or ambitious calculations; for how
      can such calculations enlist you on behalf of a ruined exile? What
      remains? Why, the motive which at your age is ever the most natural and
      the strongest. I don't blame you. Machiavelli himself allows that such a
      motive has swayed the wisest minds, and overturned the most solid States.
      In a word, young man, you are in love, and with my daughter Violante."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal was so startled by this direct and unexpected charge upon his own
      masked batteries, that he did not even attempt his defence. His head
      drooped on his breast, and he remained speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not doubt," resumed the penetrating judge of human nature, "that you
      would have been withheld by the laudable and generous scruples which
      characterize your happy age, from voluntarily disclosing to me the state
      of your heart. You might suppose that, proud of the position I once held,
      or sanguine in the hope of regaining my inheritance, I might be
      over-ambitious in my matrimonial views for Violante; or that you,
      anticipating my restoration to honours and fortune, might seem actuated by
      the last motives which influence love and youth; and, therefore, my dear
      young friend, I have departed from the ordinary custom in England, and
      adopted a very common one in my own country. With us, a suitor seldom
      presents himself till he is assured of the consent of a father. I have
      only to say this,&mdash;if I am right, and you love my daughter, my first
      object in life is to see her safe and secure; and, in a word&mdash;you
      understand me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, mightily may it comfort and console us ordinary mortals, who advance
      no pretence to superior wisdom and ability, to see the huge mistakes made
      by both these very sagacious personages,&mdash;Dr. Riccabocca, valuing
      himself on his profound acquaintance with character, and Randal Leslie,
      accustomed to grope into every hole and corner of thought and action,
      wherefrom to extract that knowledge which is power! For whereas the sage,
      judging not only by his own heart in youth, but by the general influence
      of the master passion on the young, had ascribed to Randal sentiments
      wholly foreign to that able diplomatist's nature, so no sooner had
      Riccabocca brought his speech to a close, than Randal, judging also by his
      own heart, and by the general laws which influence men of the mature age
      and boasted worldly wisdom of the pupil of Machiavelli, instantly decided
      that Riccabocca presumed upon his youth and inexperience, and meant most
      nefariously to take him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poor youth!" thought Riccabocca, "how unprepared he is for the
      happiness I give him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cunning old Jesuit!" thought Randal; "he has certainly learned, since
      we met last, that he has no chance of regaining his patrimony, and so he
      wants to impose on me the hand of a girl without a shilling. What other
      motive can he possibly have? Had his daughter the remotest probability of
      becoming the greatest heiress in Italy, would he dream of bestowing her on
      me in this off-hand way? The thing stands to reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Actuated by his resentment at the trap thus laid for him, Randal was about
      to disclaim altogether the disinterested and absurd affection laid to his
      charge, when it occurred to him that, by so doing, he might mortally
      offend the Italian, since the cunning never forgive those who refuse to be
      duped by them,&mdash;and it might still be conducive to his interest to
      preserve intimate and familiar terms with Riccabocca; therefore, subduing
      his first impulse, he exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, too generous man! pardon me if I have so long been unable to express
      my amaze, my gratitude; but I cannot&mdash;no, I cannot, while your
      prospects remain thus uncertain, avail myself of your&mdash;of your
      inconsiderate magnanimity. Your rare conduct can only redouble my own
      scruples, if you, as I firmly hope and believe, are restored to your great
      possessions&mdash;you would naturally look so much higher than me. Should
      these hopes fail, then, indeed, it may be different; yet even then, what
      position, what fortune, have I to offer to your daughter worthy of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are well born! all gentlemen are equals," said Riccabocca, with a
      sort of easy nobleness. "You have youth, information, talent,&mdash;sources
      of certain wealth in this happy country,&mdash;powerful connections; and,
      in fine, if you are satisfied with marrying for love, I shall be
      contented; if not, speak openly. As to the restoration to my possessions,
      I can scarcely think that probable while my enemy lives. And even in that
      case, since I saw you last, something has occurred," added Riccabocca,
      with a strange smile, which seemed to Randal singularly sinister and
      malignant, "that may remove all difficulties. Meanwhile, do not think me
      so extravagantly magnanimous; do not underrate the satisfaction I must
      feel at knowing Violante safe from the designs of Peschiera,&mdash;safe,
      and forever, under a husband's roof. I will tell you an Italian proverb,&mdash;it
      contains a truth full of wisdom and terror,
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Hai cinquanta Amici?&mdash;non basta. Hai un Nemico?&mdash;e troppo.'"
      ["Have you fifty friends?&mdash;it is not enough. Have you one enemy?&mdash;it
      is too much."]
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something has occurred!" echoed Randal, not heeding the conclusion of
      this speech, and scarcely hearing the proverb, which the sage delivered in
      his most emphatic and tragic tone. "Something has occurred! My dear
      friend, be plainer. What has occurred?" Riccabocca remained silent.
      "Something that induces you to bestow your daughter on me?" Riccabocca
      nodded, and emitted a low chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very laugh of a fiend," muttered Randal. "Something that makes her
      not worth bestowing. He betrays himself. Cunning people always do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," said the Italian, at last, "if I don't answer your question;
      you will know later; but at present this is a family secret. And now I
      must turn to another and more alarming cause for my frankness to you."
      Here Riccabocca's face changed, and assumed an expression of mingled rage
      and fear. "You must know," he added, sinking his voice, "that Giacomo has
      seen a strange person loitering about the house, and looking up at the
      windows; and he has no doubt&mdash;nor have I&mdash;that this is some spy
      or emissary of Peschiera's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible; how could he discover you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not; but no one else has any interest in doing so. The man kept at
      a distance, and Giacomo could not see his face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be but a mere idler. Is this all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; the old woman who serves us said that she was asked at a shop 'if we
      were not Italians'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she answered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'No;' but owned that 'we had a foreign servant, Giacomo.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see to this. Rely on it that if Peschiera has discovered you, I
      will learn it. Nay, I will hasten from you in order to commence inquiry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot detain you. May I think that we have now an interest in common?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed yes; but&mdash;but&mdash;your daughter! How can I dream that
      one so beautiful, so peerless, will confirm the hope you have extended to
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The daughter of an Italian is brought up to consider that it is a
      father's right to dispose of her hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cospetto!" said the Italian, true to his infamous notions as to the sex,
      "the heart of a girl is like a convent,&mdash;the holier the cloister, the
      more charitable the door."

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal had scarcely left the house before Mrs. Riccabocca, who was
      affectionately anxious in all that concerned Violante, rejoined her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like the young man very well," said the sage,&mdash;"very well indeed.
      I find him just what I expected, from my general knowledge of human
      nature; for as love ordinarily goes with youth, so modesty usually
      accompanies talent. He is young, ergo, he is in love; he has talent, ergo,
      he is modest, modest and ingenuous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think not in any way swayed by interest in his affections?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite the contrary; and to prove him the more, I have not said a word as
      to the worldly advantages which, in any case, would accrue to him from an
      alliance with my daughter. In any case: for if I regain my country, her
      fortune is assured; and if not, I trust" (said the poor exile, lifting his
      brow with stately and becoming pride) "that I am too well aware of my
      child's dignity, as well as my own, to ask any one to marry her to his own
      worldly injury."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! I don't quite understand you, Alphonso. To be sure, your dear life is
      insured for her marriage portion; but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pazzie-stuff!" said Riccabocca, petulantly; "her marriage portion would
      be as nothing to a young man of Randal's birth and prospects. I think not
      of that. But listen: I have never consented to profit by Harley
      L'Estrange's friendship for me; my scruples would not extend to my
      son-in-law. This noble friend has not only high rank, but considerable
      influence,&mdash;influence with the government, influence with Randal's
      patron, who, between ourselves, does not seem to push the young man as he
      might do; I judge by what Randal says. I should write, therefore, before
      anything was settled, to L'Estrange, and I should say to him simply, 'I
      never asked you to save me from penury, but I do ask you to save a
      daughter of my House from humiliation. I can give to her no dowry; can her
      husband owe to my friend that advance in an honourable career, that
      opening to energy and talent, which is more than a dowry to generous
      ambition?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is in vain you would disguise your rank," cried Jemima, with
      enthusiasm; "it speaks in all you utter, when your passions are moved."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian did not seem flattered by that eulogy. "Pish," said he, "there
      you are! rank again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jemima was right. There was something about her husband that was
      grandiose and princely, whenever he escaped from his accursed Machiavelli,
      and gave fair play to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he spent the next hour or so in thinking over all that he could do for
      Randal, and devising for his intended son-in-law the agreeable surprise,
      which Randal was at that very time racking his yet cleverer brains to
      disappoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      These plans conned sufficiently, Riccabocca shut up his Machiavelli, and
      hunted out of his scanty collection of books, Buffon on Man, and various
      other psychological volumes, in which he soon became deeply absorbed. Why
      were these works the object of the sage's study? Perhaps he will let us
      know soon, for it is clearly a secret known to his wife; and though she
      has hitherto kept one secret, that is precisely the reason why Riccabocca
      would not wish long to overburden her discretion with another.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Randal reached home in time to dress for a late dinner at Baron Levy's.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The baron's style of living was of that character especially affected both
      by the most acknowledged exquisites of that day, and, it must be owned,
      also, by the most egregious parvenus. For it is noticeable that it is your
      parvenu who always comes nearest in fashion (so far as externals are
      concerned) to your genuine exquisite. It is your parvenu who is most
      particular as to the cut of his coat, and the precision of his equipage,
      and the minutia, of his menage. Those between the parvenu and the
      exquisite, who know their own consequence, and have something solid to
      rest upon, are slow in following all the caprices of fashion, and obtuse
      in observation as to those niceties which neither give them another
      ancestor, nor add another thousand to the account at their banker's,&mdash;as
      to the last, rather indeed the contrary! There was a decided elegance
      about the baron's house and his dinner. If he had been one of the lawful
      kings of the dandies, you would have cried, "What perfect taste!"&mdash;but
      such is human nature, that the dandies who dined with him said to each
      other, "He pretend to imitate D&mdash;&mdash;! vulgar dog!" There was
      little affectation of your more showy opulence. The furniture in the rooms
      was apparently simple, but, in truth, costly, from its luxurious comfort;
      the ornaments and china scattered about the commodes were of curious
      rarity and great value, and the pictures on the walls were gems. At
      dinner, no plate was admitted on the table. The Russian fashion, then
      uncommon, now more prevalent, was adopted, fruit and flowers in old Sevres
      dishes of priceless vertu, and in sparkling glass of Bohemian fabric. No
      livery servant was permitted to wait; behind each guest stood a gentleman
      dressed so like the guest himself, in fine linen and simple black, that
      guest and lacquey seemed stereotypes from one plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The viands were exquisite; the wine came from the cellars of deceased
      archbishops and ambassadors. The company was select; the party did not
      exceed eight. Four were the eldest sons of peers (from a baron to a duke);
      one was a professed wit, never to be got without a month's notice, and,
      where a parvenu was host, a certainty of green peas and peaches&mdash;out
      of season; the sixth, to Randal's astonishment, was Mr. Richard Avenel;
      himself and the baron made up the complement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eldest sons recognized each other with a meaning smile; the most
      juvenile of them, indeed (it was his first year in London), had the grace
      to blush and look sheepish. The others were more hardened; but they all
      united in regarding with surprise both Randal and Dick Avenel. The former
      was known to most of them personally, and to all, by repute, as a grave,
      clever, promising young man, rather prudent than lavish, and never
      suspected to have got into a scrape. What the deuce did he do there? Mr.
      Avenel puzzled them yet more. A middle-aged man, said to be in business,
      whom they had observed "about town" (for he had a noticeable face and
      figure),&mdash;that is, seen riding in the Park, or lounging in the pit at
      the opera, but never set eyes on at a recognized club, or in the coteries
      of their "set;" a man whose wife gave horrid third-rate parties, that took
      up half a column in the "Morning Post" with a list of "The Company
      Present," in which a sprinkling of dowagers fading out of fashion, and a
      foreign title or two, made the darkness of the obscurer names doubly dark.
      Why this man should be asked to meet them, by Baron Levy, too&mdash;a
      decided tuft-hunter and would-be exclusive&mdash;called all their
      faculties into exercise. The wit, who, being the son of a small tradesman,
      but in the very best society, gave himself far greater airs than the young
      lords, impertinently solved the mystery. "Depend on it," whispered he to
      Spendquick,&mdash;"depend on it the man is the X. Y. of the 'Times' who
      offers to lend any sum of money from L10 to half-a-million. He's the man
      who has all your bills; Levy is only his jackal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Pon my soul," said Spendquick, rather alarmed, "if that's the case, one
      may as well be civil to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, certainly," said the wit. "But I never have found an X. Y. who would
      advance me the L. s.; and therefore I shall not be more respectful to X.
      Y. than to any other unknown quantity."
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees, as the wine circulated, the party grew gay and sociable. Levy
      was really an entertaining fellow; had all the gossip of the town at his
      fingers' ends; and possessed, moreover, that pleasant art of saying
      ill-natured things of the absent, which those present always enjoy. By
      degrees, too, Mr. Richard Avenel came out; and, as the whisper had
      circulated round the table that he was X. Y., he was listened to with a
      profound respect, which greatly elevated his spirits. Nay, when the wit
      tried once to show him up or mystify him, Dick answered with a bluff
      spirit, that, though very coarse, was found so humorous by Lord Spendquick
      and other gentlemen similarly situated in the money-market that they
      turned the laugh against the wit, and silenced him for the rest of the
      night,&mdash;a circumstance which made the party go off much more
      pleasantly. After dinner, the conversation, quite that of single men, easy
      and debonnaire, glanced from the turf and the ballet and the last scandal
      towards politics; for the times were such that politics were discussed
      everywhere, and three of the young lords were county members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal said little, but, as was his wont, listened attentively; and he was
      aghast to find how general was the belief that the Government was doomed.
      Out of regard to him, and with that delicacy of breeding which belongs to
      a certain society, nothing personal to Egerton was said, except by Avenel,
      who, however, on blurting out some rude expressions respecting that
      minister, was instantly checked by the baron. "Spare my friend and Mr.
      Leslie's near connection," said he, with a polite but grave smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Avenel, "public men, whom we pay, are public property,&mdash;aren't
      they, my Lord?" appealing to Spendquick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Spendquick, with great spirit,&mdash;"public property,
      or why should we pay them? There must be a very strong motive to induce us
      to do that! I hate paying people. In fact," he subjoined in an aside, "I
      never do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "However," resumed Mr. Avenel, graciously, "I don't want to hurt your
      feelings, Mr. Leslie. As to the feelings of our host, the baron, I
      calculate that they have got tolerably tough by the exercise they have
      gone through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless," said the baron, joining in the laugh which any lively
      saying by the supposed X. Y. was sure to excite, "nevertheless, 'love me,
      love my dog,'&mdash;love me, love my Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal started, for his quick ear and subtle intelligence caught something
      sinister and hostile in the tone with which Levy uttered this equivocal
      comparison, and his eye darted towards the baron. But the baron had bent
      down his face, and was regaling himself upon an olive.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by the party rose from table. The four young noblemen had their
      engagements elsewhere, and proposed to separate without re-entering the
      drawing-room. As, in Goethe's theory, monads which have affinities with
      each other are irresistibly drawn together, so these gay children of
      pleasure had, by a common impulse, on rising from table, moved each to
      each, and formed a group round the fireplace. Randal stood a little apart,
      musing; the wit examined the pictures through his eye-glass; and Mr.
      Avenel drew the baron towards the side-board, and there held him in
      whispered conference. This colloquy did not escape the young gentlemen
      round the fireplace; they glanced towards each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Settling the percentage on renewal," said one, sotto voce. "X. Y. does
      not seem such a very bad fellow," said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks rich, and talks rich," said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A decided, independent way of expressing his sentiments; those moneyed
      men generally have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" ejaculated Spendquick, who had been keeping his eye
      anxiously fixed on the pair, "do look; X. Y. is actually taking out his
      pocket-book; he is coming this way. Depend on it he has got our bills&mdash;mine
      is due to-morrow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mine too," said another, edging off. "Why, it is a perfect
      guet-apens."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, breaking away from the baron, who appeared anxious to detain
      him, and failing in that attempt, turned aside, as if not to see Dick's
      movements,&mdash;a circumstance which did not escape the notice of the
      group, and confirmed all their suspicions,&mdash;Mr. Avenel, with a
      serious, thoughtful face, and a slow step, approached the group. Nor did
      the great Roman general more nervously "flutter the dove-cots in Corioli,"
      than did the advance of the supposed X. Y. agitate the bosoms of Lord
      Spendquick and his sympathizing friends. Pocket-book in hand, and
      apparently feeling for something formidable within its mystic recesses,
      step by step came Dick Avenel towards the fireplace. The group stood
      still, fascinated by horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum," said Mr. Avenel, clearing his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like that hum at all," muttered Spendquick. "Proud to have made
      your acquaintance, gentlemen," said Dick, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen thus addressed bowed low in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend the baron thought this not exactly the time to&mdash;" Dick
      stopped a moment; you might have knocked down those four young gentlemen,
      though four finer specimens of humanity no aristocracy in Europe could
      produce,&mdash;you might have knocked them down with a feather! "But,"
      renewed Avenel, not finishing his sentence, "I have made it a rule in life
      never to lose securing a good opportunity; in short, to make the most of
      the present moment. And," added he, with a smile which froze the blood in
      Lord Spendquick's veins, "the rule has made me a very warm man! Therefore,
      gentlemen, allow me to present you each with one of these"&mdash;every
      hand retreated behind the back of its well-born owner, when, to the
      inexpressible relief of all, Dick concluded with,&mdash;"a little soiree
      dansante," and extended four cards of invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most happy!" exclaimed Spendquick. "I don't dance in general; but to
      oblige X&mdash;I mean, to have a better acquaintance, sir, with you&mdash;I
      would dance on the tight-rope."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a good-humoured, pleasant laugh at Spendquick's enthusiasm, and
      a general shaking of hands and pocketing of the invitation cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't look like a dancing man," said Avenel, turning to the wit, who
      was plump and somewhat gouty,&mdash;as wits who dine out five days in the
      week generally are; "but we shall have supper at one o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Infinitely offended and disgusted, the wit replied dryly, "that every hour
      of his time was engaged for the rest of the season," and, with a stiff
      salutation to the baron, took his departure. The rest, in good spirits,
      hurried away to their respective cabriolets; and Leslie was following them
      into the hall, when the baron, catching hold of him, said, "Stay, I want
      to talk to you."

      "Pleasant young men, those," said Levy, with a slight sneer, as he threw
      himself into an easy-chair and stirred the fire. "And not at all proud;
      but, to be sure, they are&mdash;under great obligations to me. Yes; they
      owe me a great deal a propos, I have had a long talk with Frank Hazeldean,&mdash;fine
      young man, remarkable capacities for business. I can arrange his affairs
      for him. I find, on reference to the Will Office, that you were quite
      right; the Casino property is entailed on Frank. He will have the fee
      simple. He can dispose of the reversion entirely. So that there will be no
      difficulty in our arrangements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I told you also that Frank had scruples about borrowing on the event
      of his father's death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, you did so. Filial affection! I never take that into account in
      matters of business. Such little scruples, though they are highly
      honourable to human nature, soon vanish before the prospect of the King's
      Bench. And, too, as you so judiciously remarked, our clever young friend
      is in love with Madame di Negra."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he tell you that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but Madame di Negra did!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know most people in good society, who now and then require a friend in
      the management of their affairs. And having made sure of the fact you
      stated, as to Hazeldean's contingent property (excuse my prudence), I have
      accommodated Madame di Negra and bought up her debts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have&mdash;you surprise me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The surprise will vanish on reflection. But you are very new to the world
      yet, my dear Leslie. By the way, I have had an interview with Peschiera&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About his sister's debts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Partly. A man of the nicest honour is Peschiera." Aware of Levy's habit
      of praising people for the qualities in which, according to the judgment
      of less penetrating mortals, they were most deficient, Randal only smiled
      at this eulogy, and waited for Levy to resume. But the baron sat silent
      and thoughtful for a minute or two, and then wholly changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think your father has some property in &mdash;&mdash;shire, and you
      probably can give me a little information as to certain estates of a Mr.
      Thornhill, estates which, on examination of the title-deeds, I find once,
      indeed, belonged to your family." The baron glanced at a very elegant
      memorandum-book.&mdash;"The manors of Rood and Dulmansberry, with sundry
      farms thereon. Mr. Thornhill wants to sell them&mdash;an old client of
      mine, Thornhill. He has applied to me on the matter. Do you think it an
      improvable property?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal listened with a livid cheek and a throbbing heart. We have seen
      that, if there was one ambitious scheme in his calculation which, though
      not absolutely generous and heroic, still might win its way to a certain
      sympathy in the undebased human mind, it was the hope to restore the
      fallen fortunes of his ancient house, and repossess himself of the long
      alienated lands that surrounded the dismal wastes of the mouldering hall.
      And now to hear that those lands were getting into the inexorable gripe of
      Levy&mdash;tears of bitterness stood in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thornhill," continued Levy, who watched the young man's countenance,&mdash;"Thornhill
      tells me that that part of his property&mdash;the old Leslie lands&mdash;produces
      L2, 000 a year, and that the rental could be raised. He would take L50,000
      for it, L20,000 down, and suffer the remaining L30,000 to lie on mortgage
      at four per cent. It seems a very good purchase. What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ask me," said Randal, stung into rare honesty; "for I had hoped I
      might live to repossess myself of that property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, indeed! It would be a very great addition to your consequence in the
      world,&mdash;not from the mere size of the estate, but from its hereditary
      associations. And if you have any idea of the purchase, believe me, I'll
      not stand in your way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I have any idea of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought you said you had."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understood that these lands could not be sold till Mr. Thornhill's son
      came of age, and joined in getting rid of the entail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, so Thornhill himself supposed, till, on examining the title-deeds, I
      found he was under a mistake. These lands are not comprised in the
      settlement made by old Jasper Thornhill, which ties up the rest of the
      property. The title will be perfect. Thornhill wants to settle the matter
      at once,&mdash;losses on the turf, you understand; an immediate purchaser
      would get still better terms. A Sir John Spratt would give the money; but
      the addition of these lands would make the Spratt property of more
      consequence in the county than the Thornhill. So my client would rather
      take a few thousands less from a man who don't set up to be his rival.
      Balance of power in counties as well as nations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Levy, with great kindness of manner, "I see I pain you; and
      though I am what my very pleasant guests would call a parvenu, I
      comprehend your natural feelings as a gentleman of ancient birth. Parvenu!
      Ah, is it not strange, Leslie, that no wealth, no fashion, no fame can
      wipe out that blot? They call me a parvenu, and borrow my money. They call
      our friend the wit a parvenu, and submit to all his insolence&mdash;if
      they condescend to regard his birth at all&mdash;provided they can but get
      him to dinner. They call the best debater in the parliament of England a
      parvenu, and will entreat him, some day or other, to be prime minister,
      and ask him for stars and garters. A droll world, and no wonder the
      parvenus want to upset it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal had hitherto supposed that this notorious tufthunter, this dandy
      capitalist, this money-lender, whose whole fortune had been wrung from the
      wants and follies of an aristocracy, was naturally a firm supporter of
      things as they are&mdash;how could things be better for men like Baron
      Levy? But the usurer's burst of democratic spleen did not surprise his
      precocious and acute faculty of observation. He had before remarked, that
      it is the persons who fawn most upon an aristocracy, and profit the most
      by the fawning, who are ever at heart its bitterest disparagers. Why is
      this? Because one full half of democratic opinion is made up of envy; and
      we can only envy what is brought before our eyes, and what, while very
      near to us, is still unattainable. No man envies an archangel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Levy, throwing himself back in his chair, "a new order of
      things is commencing; we shall see. Leslie, it is lucky for you that you
      did not enter parliament under the government; it would be your political
      ruin for life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think, then, that the ministry really cannot last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do; and what is more, I think that a ministry of the same
      principles cannot be restored. You are a young man of talent and spirit;
      your birth is nothing compared to the rank of the reigning party; it would
      tell, to a certain degree, in a democratic one. I say, you should be more
      civil to Avenel; he could return you to parliament at the next election."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next election! In six years! We have just had a general election."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be another before this year, or half of it, or perhaps a
      quarter of it, is out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leslie, let there be confidence between us; we can help each other. Shall
      we be friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart. But though you may help me, how can I help you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have helped me already to Frank Hazeldean and the Casino estate. All
      clever men can help me. Come, then, we are friends; and what I say is
      secret. You ask me why I think there will be a general election so soon? I
      will answer you frankly. Of all the public men I ever met with, there is
      no one who has so clear a vision of things immediately before him as
      Audley Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has that character. Not far-seeing, but clear-sighted to a certain
      limit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly so. No one better, therefore, knows public opinion and its
      immediate ebb and flow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egerton, then, counts on a general election within three months, and I
      have lent him the money for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lent him the money! Egerton borrow money of you, the rich Audley
      Egerton!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rich!" repeated Levy, in a tone impossible to describe, and accompanying
      the word with that movement of the middle finger and thumb, commonly
      called a "snap," which indicates profound contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more. Randal sat stupefied. At length the latter muttered, "But
      if Egerton is really not rich; if he lose office, and without the hope of
      return to it&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If so, he is ruined!" said Levy, coldly; "and therefore, from regard to
      you, and feeling interest in your future fate, I say, Rest no hopes of
      fortune or career upon Audley Egerton. Keep your place for the present,
      but be prepared at the next election to stand upon popular principles.
      Avenel shall return you to parliament; and the rest is with luck and
      energy. And now, I'll not detain you longer," said Levy, rising and
      ringing the bell. The servant entered. "Is my carriage here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Baron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I set you down anywhere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, I prefer walking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, then. And mind you remember the soiree dansante at Mrs. Avenel's."
      Randal mechanically shook the hand extended to him, and went down the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fresh frosty air roused his intellectual faculties, which Levy's
      ominous words had almost paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the first thing the clever schemer said to himself was this,
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what can be the man's motive in what he said to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next was,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egerton ruined! What am I, then?" And the third was,
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that fair remnant of the old Leslie property! L20,000 down&mdash;how
      to get the sum? Why should Levy have spoken to me of this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And lastly, the soliloquy rounded back&mdash;"The man's motives! His
      motives!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the baron threw himself into his chariot&mdash;the most
      comfortable, easy chariot you can possibly conceive, single man's chariot,
      perfect taste,&mdash;no married man ever had such a chariot; and in a few
      minutes he was at &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-'s hotel, and in the
      presence of Giulio Franzini, Count di Peschiera.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mon cher," said the baron, in very good French, and in a tone of the most
      familiar equality with the descendant of the princes and heroes of grand
      medieval Italy,&mdash;"mon cher, give me one of your excellent cigars. I
      think I have put all matters in train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have found out&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; not so fast yet," said the baron, lighting the cigar extended to him.
      "But you said that you should be perfectly contented if it only cost you
      L20,000 to marry off your sister (to whom that sum is legally due), and to
      marry yourself to the heiress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I have no doubt I shall manage both objects for that sum, if Randal
      Leslie really knows where the young lady is, and can assist you. Most
      promising, able man is Randal Leslie&mdash;but innocent as a babe just
      born."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha! Innocent? Que diable!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Innocent as this cigar, mon cher,&mdash;strong certainly, but smoked very
      easily. Soyez tranquille!"

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Who has not seen, who not admired, that noble picture by Daniel Maclise,
      which refreshes the immortal name of my ancestor Caxton! For myself, while
      with national pride I heard the admiring murmurs of the foreigners who
      grouped around it (nothing, indeed, of which our nation may be more proud
      had they seen in the Crystal Palace),&mdash;heard, with no less a pride in
      the generous nature of fellow-artists, the warm applause of living and
      deathless masters sanctioning the enthusiasm of the popular crowd, what
      struck me more than the precision of drawing, for which the artist has
      been always renowned, and the just, though gorgeous affluence of colour
      which he has more recently acquired, was the profound depth of conception,
      out of which this great work had so elaborately arisen. That monk, with
      his scowl towards the printer and his back on the Bible over which his
      form casts a shadow&mdash;the whole transition between the medieval
      Christianity of cell and cloister, and the modern Christianity that
      rejoices in the daylight, is depicted there, in the shadow that obscures
      the Book, in the scowl that is fixed upon the Book-diffuser;&mdash;that
      sombre, musing face of Richard, Duke of Gloucester, with the beauty of
      Napoleon, darkened to the expression of a Fiend, looking far and anxiously
      into futurity, as if foreseeing there what antagonism was about to be
      created to the schemes of secret crime and unrelenting force; the
      chivalrous head of the accomplished Rivers, seen but in profile, under his
      helmet, as if the age when Chivalry must defend its noble attributes in
      steel was already half passed away; and, not least grand of all, the rude
      thews and sinews of the artisan forced into service on the type, and the
      ray of intellect, fierce, and menacing revolutions yet to be, struggling
      through his rugged features, and across his low knitted brow,&mdash;all
      this, which showed how deeply the idea of the discovery in its good and
      its evil, its saving light and its perilous storms, had sunk into the
      artist's soul, charmed me as effecting the exact union between sentiment
      and execution, which is the true and rare consummation of the Ideal in
      Art. But observe, while in these personages of the group are depicted the
      deeper and graver agencies implicated in the bright but terrible
      invention, observe how little the light epicures of the hour heed the
      scowl of the monk, or the restless gesture of Richard, or the troubled
      gleam in the eyes of the artisan, King Edward, handsome Poco curante,
      delighted in the surprise of a child, with a new toy, and Clarence, with
      his curious, yet careless, glance,&mdash;all the while Caxton himself,
      calm, serene, untroubled, intent solely upon the manifestation of his
      discovery, and no doubt supremely indifferent whether the first proofs of
      it shall be dedicated to a Rivers or an Edward, a Richard or a Henry,
      Plantagenet or Tudor&mdash;'t is all the same to that comely,
      gentle-looking man. So is it ever with your Abstract Science!&mdash;not a
      jot cares its passionless logic for the woe or weal of a generation or
      two. The stream, once emerged from its source, passes on into the great
      Intellectual Sea, smiling over the wretch that it drowns, or under the
      keel of the ship which it serves as a slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when about to commence the present chapter on the Varieties of Life,
      this masterpiece of thoughtful art forced itself on my recollection, and
      illustrated what I designed to convey. In the surface of every age it is
      often that which but amuses for the moment the ordinary children of
      pleasant existence, the Edwards and the Clarences (be they kings and
      dukes, or simplest of simple subjects), which afterwards towers out as the
      great serious epoch of the time. When we look back upon human records, how
      the eye settles upon WRITERS as the main landmarks of the past! We talk of
      the age of Augustus, of Elizabeth, of Louis XIV., of Anne, as the notable
      eras of the world. Why? Because it is their writers who have made them so.
      Intervals between one age of authors and another lie unnoticed, as the
      flats and common lands of uncultured history. And yet, strange to say,
      when these authors are living amongst us, they occupy a very small portion
      of our thoughts, and fill up but desultory interstices in the bitumen and
      tufo wherefrom we build up the Babylon of our lives. So it is, and perhaps
      so it should be, whether it pleases the conceit of penmen or not. Life is
      meant to be active; and books, though they give the action to future
      generations, administer but to the holiday of the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, with this long preface, I turn suddenly from the Randals and the
      Egertons, and the Levys, Avenels, and Peschieras, from the plots and
      passions of practical life, and drop the reader suddenly into one of those
      obscure retreats wherein Thought weaves, from unnoticed moments, a new
      link to the chain that unites the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a small room, the single window of which opened on a fanciful and
      fairy-like garden that has been before described, sat a young man alone.
      He had been writing; the ink was not dry on his manuscript, but his
      thoughts had been suddenly interrupted from his work, and his eyes, now
      lifted from the letter which had occasioned that interruption, sparkled
      with delight. "He will come," exclaimed the young man; "come here,&mdash;to
      the home which I owe to him. I have not been unworthy of his friendship.
      And she&mdash;" his breast heaved, but the joy faded from his face. "Oh,
      strange, strange, that I feel sad at the thought to see her again! See her&mdash;Ah,
      no! my own comforting Helen, my own Child-angel! Her I can never see
      again! The grown woman&mdash;that is not my Helen. And yet&mdash;and yet,"
      he resumed after a pause, "if ever she read the pages in which thought
      flowed and trembled under her distant starry light, if ever she see how
      her image has rested with me, and feel that, while others believe that I
      invent, I have but remembered, will she not, for a moment, be my own Helen
      again? Again, in heart and in fancy, stand by my side on the desolate
      bridge, hand in hand, orphans both, as we stood in the days so sorrowful,
      yet, as I recall them, so sweet? Helen in England&mdash;it is a dream!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, half-consciously, and went to the window. The fountain played
      merrily before his eyes, and the birds in the aviary carolled loud to his
      ear. "And in this house," he murmured, "I saw her last! And there, where
      the fountain now throws its spray on high,&mdash;there her benefactor and
      mine told me that I was to lose her, that I might win&mdash;fame. Alas!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time a woman, whose dress was somewhat above her mien and air,
      which, though not without a certain respectability, were very homely,
      entered the room; and seeing the young man standing thus thoughtful by the
      window, paused. She was used to his habits; and since his success in life,
      had learned to respect them. So she did not disturb his revery, but began
      softly to arrange the room, dusting, with the corner of her apron, the
      various articles of furniture, putting a stray chair or two in its right
      place, but not touching a single paper. Virtuous woman, and rare as
      virtuous!
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man turned at last, with a deep, yet not altogether painful
      sigh,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear mother, good day to you. Ah, you do well to make the room look
      its best. Happy news! I expect a visitor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, Leonard, will he want lunch&mdash;or what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I think not, Mother. It is he to whom we owe all,&mdash;'Haec otia
      fecit.' Pardon my Latin; it is Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of Mrs. Fairfield (the reader has long since divined the name)
      changed instantly, and betrayed a nervous twitch of all the muscles, which
      gave her a family likeness to old Mrs. Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be alarmed, Mother. He is the kindest&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk so; I can't bear it!" cried Mrs. Fairfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No wonder you are affected by the recollection of all his benefits. But
      when once you have seen him, you will find yourself ever after at your
      ease. And so, pray smile and look as good as you are; for I am proud of
      your open honest look when you are pleased, Mother. And he must see your
      heart in your face, as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, Leonard put his arm round the widow's neck and kissed her. She
      clung to him fondly for a moment, and he felt her tremble from head to
      foot. Then she broke from his embrace, and hurried out of the room.
      Leonard thought perhaps she had gone to improve her dress, or to carry her
      housewife energies to the decoration of the other rooms; for "the house"
      was Mrs. Fairfield's hobby and passion; and now that she worked no more,
      save for her amusement, it was her main occupation. The hours she
      contrived to spend daily in bustling about those little rooms, and leaving
      everything therein to all appearance precisely the same, were among the
      marvels in life which the genius of Leonard had never comprehended. But
      she was always so delighted when Mr. Norreys, or some rare visitor came,
      and said,&mdash;Mr. Norreys never failed to do so,-"How neatly all is kept
      here. What could Leonard do without you, Mrs. Fairfield?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And, to Norreys's infinite amusement, Mrs. Fairfield always returned the
      same answer. "'Deed, sir, and thank you kindly, but 't is my belief that
      the drawin'-room would be awful dusty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more left alone, Leonard's mind returned to the state of revery, and
      his face assumed the expression that had now become to it habitual. Thus
      seen, he was changed much since we last beheld him. His cheek was more
      pale and thin, his lips more firmly compressed, his eye more fixed and
      abstract. You could detect, if I may borrow a touching French expression,
      that "Sorrow had passed by there." But the melancholy on his countenance
      was ineffably sweet and serene, and on his ample forehead there was that
      power, so rarely seen in early youth,&mdash;the power that has conquered,
      and betrays its conquests but in calm. The period of doubt, of struggle,
      of defiance, was gone, perhaps forever; genius and soul were reconciled to
      human life. It was a face most lovable; so gentle and peaceful in its
      character. No want of fire; on the contrary, the fire was so clear and so
      steadfast, that it conveyed but the impression of light. The candour of
      boyhood, the simplicity of the villager, were still there,&mdash;refined
      by intelligence, but intelligence that seemed to have traversed through
      knowledge, not with the 'footstep, but the wing, unsullied by the mire,
      tending towards the star, seeking through the various grades of Being but
      the lovelier forms of truth and goodness; at home, as should be the Art
      that consummates the Beautiful,&mdash;

    <p>
      From this revery Leonard did not seek to rouse himself, till the bell at
      the garden gate rang loud and shrill; and then starting up and hurrying
      into the hall, his hand was grasped in Harley's.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A full and happy hour passed away in Harley's questions and Leonard's
      answers,&mdash;the dialogue that naturally ensued between the two, on the
      first interview after an absence of years so eventful to the younger man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Leonard during this interval was almost solely internal,
      the struggle of intellect with its own difficulties, the wanderings of
      imagination through its own adventurous worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first aim of Norreys, in preparing the mind of his pupil for its
      vocation, had been to establish the equilibrium of its powers, to calm
      into harmony the elements rudely shaken by the trials and passions of the
      old hard outer life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory of Norreys was briefly this: The education of a superior human
      being is but the development of ideas in one for the benefit of others. To
      this end, attention should be directed,&mdash;1st, To the value of the
      ideas collected; 2dly, To their discipline; 3dly, To their expression. For
      the first, acquirement is necessary; for the second, discipline; for the
      third, art. The first comprehends knowledge purely intellectual, whether
      derived from observation, memory, reflection, books, or men, Aristotle or
      Fleet Street. The second demands training, not only intellectual, but
      moral; the purifying and exaltation of motives; the formation of habits;
      in which method is but a part of a divine and harmonious symmetry, a union
      of intellect and conscience. Ideas of value, stored by the first process;
      marshalled into force, and placed under guidance, by the second,&mdash;it
      is the result of the third, to place them before the world in the most
      attractive or commanding form. This may be done by actions no less than
      words; but the adaptation of means to end, the passage of ideas from the
      brain of one man into the lives and souls of all, no less in action than
      in books, requires study. Action has its art as well as literature. Here
      Norreys had but to deal with the calling of the scholar, the formation of
      the writer, and so to guide the perceptions towards those varieties in the
      sublime and beautiful, the just combination of which is at once CREATION.
      Man himself is but a combination of elements. He who combines in nature,
      creates in art. Such, very succinctly and inadequately expressed, was the
      system upon which Norreys proceeded to regulate and perfect the great
      native powers of his pupil; and though the reader may perhaps say that no
      system laid down by another can either form genius or dictate to its
      results, yet probably nine-tenths at least of those in whom we recognize
      the luminaries of our race have passed, unconsciously to themselves (for
      self-education is rarely conscious of its phases), through each of these
      processes. And no one who pauses to reflect will deny, that according to
      this theory, illustrated by a man of vast experience, profound knowledge,
      and exquisite taste, the struggles of genius would be infinitely lessened,
      its vision cleared and strengthened, and the distance between effort and
      success notably abridged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norreys, however, was far too deep a reasoner to fall into the error of
      modern teachers, who suppose that education can dispense with labour. No
      mind becomes muscular without rude and early exercise. Labour should be
      strenuous, but in right directions. All that we can do for it is to save
      the waste of time in blundering into needless toils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master had thus first employed his neophyte in arranging and compiling
      materials for a great critical work in which Norreys himself was engaged.
      In this stage of scholastic preparation, Leonard was necessarily led to
      the acquisition of languages, for which he had great aptitude; the
      foundations of a large and comprehensive erudition were solidly
      constructed. He traced by the ploughshare the walls of the destined city.
      Habits of accuracy and of generalization became formed insensibly; and
      that precious faculty which seizes, amidst accumulated materials, those
      that serve the object for which they are explored,&mdash;that faculty
      which quadruples all force, by concentrating it on one point,&mdash;once
      roused into action, gave purpose to every toil and quickness to each
      perception. But Norreys did not confine his pupil solely to the mute world
      of a library; he introduced him to some of the first minds in arts,
      science, and letters, and active life. "These," said he, "are the living
      ideas of the present, out of which books for the future will be written:
      study them; and here, as in the volumes of the past, diligently amass and
      deliberately compile."
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees Norreys led on that young ardent mind from the selection of
      ideas to their aesthetic analysis,&mdash;from compilation to criticism;
      but criticism severe, close, and logical,&mdash;a reason for each word of
      praise or of blame. Led in this stage of his career to examine into the
      laws of beauty, a new light broke upon his mind; from amidst the masses of
      marble he had piled around him rose the vision of the statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, suddenly, one day Norreys said to him, "I need a compiler no
      longer,&mdash;maintain yourself by your own creations." And Leonard wrote,
      and a work flowered up from the seed deep buried, and the soil well
      cleared to the rays of the sun and the healthful influence of expanded
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      That first work did not penetrate to a very wide circle of readers, not
      from any perceptible fault of its own&mdash;there is luck in these things;
      the first anonymous work of an original genius is rarely at once eminently
      successful. But the more experienced recognized the promise of the book.
      Publishers, who have an instinct in the discovery of available talent,
      which often forestalls the appreciation of the public, volunteered liberal
      offers. "Be fully successful this time," said Norreys; "think not of
      models nor of style. Strike at once at the common human heart,&mdash;throw
      away the corks, swim out boldly. One word more,&mdash;never write a page
      till you have walked from your room to Temple Bar, and, mingling with men,
      and reading the human face, learn why great poets have mostly passed their
      lives in cities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Leonard wrote again, and woke one morning to find himself famous. So
      far as the chances of all professions dependent on health will permit,
      present independence, and, with foresight and economy, the prospects of
      future competence were secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, indeed," said Leonard, concluding a longer but a simpler narrative
      than is here told,&mdash;"indeed, there is some chance that I may obtain
      at once a sum that will leave me free for the rest of my life to select my
      own subjects, and write without care for remuneration. This is what I call
      the true (and, perhaps, alas! the rare) independence of him who devotes
      himself to letters. Norreys, having seen my boyish plan for the
      improvement of certain machinery in the steam engine, insisted on my
      giving much time to mechanics. The study that once pleased me so greatly
      now seemed dull; but I went into it with good heart; and the result is,
      that I have improved so far on my original idea, that my scheme has met
      the approbation of one of our most scientific engineers: and I am assured
      that the patent for it will be purchased of me upon terms which I am
      ashamed to name to you, so disproportioned do they seem to the value of so
      simple a discovery. Meanwhile, I am already rich enough to have realized
      the two dreams of my heart,&mdash;to make a home in the cottage where I
      had last seen you and Helen&mdash;I mean Miss Digby; and to invite to that
      home her who had sheltered my infancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother, where is she? Let me see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard ran out to call the widow, but to his surprise and vexation
      learned that she had quitted the house before L'Estrange arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back, perplexed how to explain what seemed ungracious and
      ungrateful, and spoke with hesitating lip and flushed cheek of the widow's
      natural timidity and sense of her own homely station. "And so overpowered
      is she," added Leonard, "by the recollection of all that we owe to you,
      that she never hears your name without agitation or tears, and trembled
      like a leaf at the thought of seeing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" said Harley, with visible emotion. "Is it so?" And he bent down,
      shading his face with his hand. "And," he renewed, after a pause, but not
      looking up&mdash;"and you ascribe this fear of seeing me, this agitation
      at my name, solely to an exaggerated sense of&mdash;of the circumstances
      attending my acquaintance with yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, perhaps, to a sort of shame that the mother of one you have made her
      proud of is but a peasant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all?" said Harley, earnestly, now looking up and fixing eyes in
      which stood tears upon Leonard's ingenuous brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear Lord, what else can it be? Do not judge her harshly."
    </p>
    <p>
      L'Estrange arose abruptly, pressed Leonard's hand, muttered something not
      audible, and then drawing his young friend's arm in his, led him into the
      garden, and turned the conversation back to its former topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard's heart yearned to ask after Helen, and yet something withheld him
      from doing so, till, seeing Harley did not volunteer to speak of her, he
      could not resist his impulse. "And Helen&mdash;Miss Digby&mdash;is she
      much changed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Changed, no&mdash;yes; very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much!" Leonard sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall see her again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Harley, in a tone of surprise. "How can you doubt it?
      And I reserve to you the pleasure of saying that you are renowned. You
      blush; well, I will say that for you. But you shall give her your books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has not yet read them, then?&mdash;not the last? The first was not
      worthy of her attention," said Leonard, disappointed. "She has only just
      arrived in England; and, though your books reached me in Germany, she was
      not then with me. When I have settled some business that will take me from
      town, I shall present you to her and my mother." There was a certain
      embarrassment in Harley's voice as he spoke; and, turning round abruptly,
      he exclaimed, "But you have shown poetry even here. I could not have
      conceived that so much beauty could be drawn from what appeared to me the
      most commonplace of all suburban gardens. Why, surely, where that charming
      fountain now plays stood the rude bench in which I read your verses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true; I wished to unite all together my happiest associations. I
      think I told you, my Lord, in one of my letters, that I had owed a very
      happy, yet very struggling time in my boyhood to the singular kindness and
      generous instructions of a foreigner whom I served. This fountain is
      copied from one that I made in his garden, and by the margin of which many
      a summer day I have sat and dreamed of fame and knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, you told me of that; and your foreigner will be pleased to hear of
      your success, and no less so of your grateful recollections. By the way,
      you did not mention his name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Riccabocca."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Riccabocca! My own dear and noble friend!&mdash;is it possible? One of my
      reasons for returning to England is connected with him. You shall go down
      with me and see him. I meant to start this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lord," said Leonard, "I think that you may spare yourself so long
      a journey. I have reason to suspect that Signor Riccabocca is my nearest
      neighbour. Two days ago I was in the garden, when suddenly lifting my eyes
      to yon hillock I perceived the form of a man seated amongst the brushwood;
      and though I could not see his features, there was something in the very
      outline of his figure and his peculiar posture, that irresistibly reminded
      me of Riccabocca. I hastened out of the garden and ascended the hill, but
      he was gone. My suspicions were so strong that I caused inquiry to be made
      at the different shops scattered about, and learned that a family
      consisting of a gentleman, his wife, and daughter had lately come to live
      in a house that you must have passed in your way hither, standing a little
      back from the road, surrounded by high walls; and though they were said to
      be English, yet from the description given to me of the gentleman's person
      by one who had noticed it, by the fact of a foreign servant in their
      employ, and by the very name 'Richmouth,' assigned to the newcomers, I can
      scarcely doubt that it is the family you seek."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have not called to ascertain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, but the family so evidently shunning observation (no one but
      the master himself ever seen without the walls), the adoption of another
      name too, led me to infer that Signor Riccabocca has some strong motive
      for concealment; and now, with my improved knowledge of life, and
      recalling all the past, I cannot but suppose that Riccabocca was not what
      he appeared. Hence, I have hesitated on formally obtruding myself upon his
      secrets, whatever they be, and have rather watched for some chance
      occasion to meet him in his walks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did right, my dear Leonard; but my reasons for seeing my old friend
      forbid all scruples of delicacy, and I will go at once to his house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will tell me, my Lord, if I am right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope to be allowed to do so. Pray, stay at home till I return. And now,
      ere I go, one question more: You indulge conjectures as to Riccabocca,
      because he has changed his name,&mdash;why have you dropped your own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wished to have no name," said Leonard, colouring deeply, "but that
      which I could make myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proud poet, this I can comprehend. But from what reason did you assume
      the strange and fantastic name of Oran?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The flush on Leonard's face became deeper. "My Lord," said he, in a low
      voice, "it is a childish fancy of mine; it is an anagram."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a time when my cravings after knowledge were likely much to mislead,
      and perhaps undo me, I chanced on some poems that suddenly affected my
      whole mind, and led me up into purer air; and I was told that these poems
      were written in youth by one who had beauty and genius,&mdash;one who was
      in her grave,&mdash;a relation of my own, and her familiar name was Nora&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," again ejaculated Lord L'Estrange, and his arm pressed heavily upon
      Leonard's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, somehow or other," continued the young author, falteringly, "I wished
      that if ever I won to a poet's fame, it might be to my own heart, at
      least, associated with this name of Nora; with her whom death had robbed
      of the fame that she might otherwise have won; with her who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, greatly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was no less so. But, as if by a sudden impulse, the soldier bent
      down his manly head and kissed the poet's brow; then he hastened to the
      gate, flung himself on his horse, and rode away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange did not proceed at once to Riecabocca's house. He was
      under the influence of a remembrance too deep and too strong to yield
      easily to the lukewarm claim of friendship. He rode fast and far; and
      impossible it would be to define the feelings that passed through a mind
      so acutely sensitive, and so rootedly tenacious of all affections. When,
      recalling his duty to the Italian, he once more struck into the road to
      Norwood, the slow pace of his horse was significant of his own exhausted
      spirits; a deep dejection had succeeded to feverish excitement. "Vain
      task," he murmured, "to wean myself from the dead! Yet I am now betrothed
      to another; and she, with all her virtues, is not the one to&mdash;" He
      stopped short in generous self-rebuke. "Too late to think of that! Now,
      all that should remain to me is to insure the happiness of the life to
      which I have pledged my own. But&mdash;" He sighed as he so murmured. On
      reaching the vicinity of Riccabocca's house, he put up his horse at a
      little inn, and proceeded on foot across the heathland towards the dull
      square building, which Leonard's description had sufficed to indicate as
      the exile's new home. It was long before any one answered his summons at
      the gate. Not till he had thrice rung did he hear a heavy step on the
      gravel walk within; then the wicket within the gate was partially drawn
      aside, a dark eye gleamed out, and a voice in imperfect English asked who
      was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange; and if I am right as to the person I seek, that name
      will at once admit me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door flew open as did that of the mystic cavern at the sound of "Open,
      Sesame;" and Giacomo, almost weeping with joyous emotion, exclaimed in
      Italian, "The good Lord! Holy San Giacomo! thou hast heard me at last! We
      are safe now." And dropping the blunderbuss with which he had taken the
      precaution to arm himself, he lifted Harley's hand to his lips, in the
      affectionate greeting familiar to his countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the padrone?" asked Harley, as he entered the jealous precincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he is just gone out; but he will not be long. You will wait for him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. What lady is that I see at the far end of the garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless her, it is our signorina. I will run and tell her you are come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I am come; but she cannot know me even by name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Excellency, can you think so? Many and many a time has she talked to
      me of you, and I have heard her pray to the holy Madonna to bless you, and
      in a voice so sweet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, I will present myself to her. Go into the house, and we will wait
      without for the padrone. Nay, I need the air, my friend." Harley, as he
      said this, broke from Giacomo, and approached Violante.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor child, in her solitary walk in the obscurer parts of the dull
      garden, had escaped the eye of Giacomo when he had gone forth to answer
      the bell; and she, unconscious of the fears of which she was the object,
      had felt something of youthful curiosity at the summons at the gate, and
      the sight of a stranger in close and friendly conference with the unsocial
      Giacomo.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Harley now neared her with that singular grace of movement which
      belonged to him, a thrill shot through her heart, she knew not why. She
      did not recognize his likeness to the sketch taken by her father from his
      recollections of Harley's early youth. She did not guess who he was; and
      yet she felt herself colour, and, naturally fearless though she was,
      turned away with a vague alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon my want of ceremony, Signorina," said Harley, in Italian; "but I
      am so old a friend of your father's that I cannot feel as a stranger to
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Violante lifted to him her dark eyes so intelligent and so innocent,&mdash;eyes
      full of surprise, but not displeased surprise. And Harley himself stood
      amazed, and almost abashed, by the rich and marvellous beauty that beamed
      upon him. "My father's friend," she said hesitatingly, "and I never to
      have seen you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Signorina," said Harley (and something of its native humour, half
      arch, half sad, played round his lip), "you are mistaken there; you have
      seen me before, and you received me much more kindly then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signor!" said Violante, more and more surprised, and with a yet richer
      colour on her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley, who had now recovered from the first effect of her beauty, and who
      regarded her as men of his years and character are apt to regard ladies in
      their teens, as more child than woman, suffered himself to be amused by
      her perplexity; for it was in his nature that the graver and more mournful
      he felt at heart, the more he sought to give play and whim to his spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, Signorina," said he, demurely, "you insisted then on placing one
      of those fair hands in mine; the other (forgive me the fidelity of my
      recollections) was affectionately thrown around my neck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signor!" again exclaimed Violante; but this time there was anger in her
      voice as well as surprise, and nothing could be more charming than her
      look of pride and resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley smiled again, but with so much kindly sweetness, that the anger
      vanished at once, or rather Violante felt angry with herself that she was
      no longer angry with him. But she had looked so beautiful in her anger,
      that Harley wished, perhaps, to see her angry again. So, composing his
      lips from their propitiatory smile, he resumed gravely,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your flatterers will tell you, Signorina, that you are much improved
      since then, but I liked you better as you were; not but what I hope to
      return some day what you then so generously pressed upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pressed upon you!&mdash;I? Signor, you are under some strange mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! no; but the female heart is so capricious and fickle! You pressed
      it upon me, I assure you. I own that I was not loath to accept it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pressed it! Pressed what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your kiss, my child," said Harley; and then added, with a serious
      tenderness, "and I again say that I hope to return it some day, when I see
      you, by the side of father and of husband, in your native land,&mdash;the
      fairest bride on whom the skies of Italy ever smiled! And now, pardon a
      hermit and a soldier for his rude jests, and give your hand, in token of
      that pardon, to Harley L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante, who at the first words of his address had recoiled, with a vague
      belief that the stranger was out of his mind, sprang forward as it closed,
      and in all the vivid enthusiasm of her nature pressed the hand held out to
      her with both her own. "Harley L'Estrange! the preserver of my father's
      life!" she cried; and her eyes were fixed on his with such evident
      gratitude and reverence, that Harley felt at once confused and delighted.
      She did not think at that instant of the hero of her dreams,&mdash;she
      thought but of him who had saved her father. But, as his eyes sank before
      her own, and his head, uncovered, bowed over the hand he held, she
      recognized the likeness to the features on which she had so often gazed.
      The first bloom of youth was gone, but enough of youth still remained to
      soften the lapse of years, and to leave to manhood the attractions which
      charm the eye. Instinctively she withdrew her hands from his clasp, and in
      her turn looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this pause of embarrassment to both, Riccabocca let himself into the
      garden by his own latch-key, and, startled to see a man by the side of
      Violante, sprang forward with an abrupt and angry cry. Harley heard, and
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if restored to courage and self-possession by the sense of her father's
      presence, Violante again took the hand of the visitor. "Father," she said
      simply, "it is he,&mdash;he is come at last." And then, retiring a few
      steps, she contemplated them both; and her face was radiant with
      happiness, as if something, long silently missed and looked for, was as
      silently found, and life had no more a want, nor the heart a void.

      INITIAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      UPON THIS FACT,&mdash;THAT THE WORLD IS STILL MUCH THE SAME AS IT ALWAYS
      HAS BEEN.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is observed by a very pleasant writer, read nowadays only by the brave
      pertinacious few who still struggle hard to rescue from the House of Pluto
      the souls of departed authors, jostled and chased as those souls are by
      the noisy footsteps of the living,&mdash;it is observed by the admirable
      Charron, that "judgment and wisdom is not only the best, but the happiest
      portion God Almighty hath distributed amongst men; for though this
      distribution be made with a very uneven hand, yet nobody thinks himself
      stinted or ill-dealt with, but he that hath never so little is contented
      in this respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, certainly, the present narrative may serve in notable illustration of
      the remark so dryly made by the witty and wise preacher. For whether our
      friend Riccabocca deduce theories for daily life from the great folio of
      Machiavelli; or that promising young gentleman, Mr. Randal Leslie,
      interpret the power of knowledge into the art of being too knowing for
      dull honest folks to cope with him; or acute Dick Avenel push his way up
      the social ascent with a blow for those before, and a kick for those
      behind him, after the approved fashion of your strong New Man; or Baron
      Levy&mdash;that cynical impersonation of Gold&mdash;compare himself to the
      Magnetic Rock in the Arabian tale, to which the nails in every ship that
      approaches the influence of the loadstone fly from the planks, and a
      shipwreck per day adds its waifs to the Rock,&mdash;questionless, at
      least; it is, that each of those personages believes that Providence has
      bestowed on him an elder son's inheritance of wisdom. Nor, were we to
      glance towards the obscurer paths of life, should we find good Parson Dale
      deem himself worse off than the rest of the world in this precious
      commodity,&mdash;as, indeed, he has signally evinced of late in that
      shrewd guess of his touching Professor Moss. Even plain Squire Hazeldean
      takes it for granted that he could teach Audley Egerton a thing or two
      worth knowing in politics; Mr. Stirn thinks that there is no branch of
      useful lore on which he could not instruct the squire; while Sprott the
      tinker, with his bag full of tracts and lucifer matches, regards the whole
      framework of modern society, from a rick to a constitution, with the
      profound disdain of a revolutionary philosopher. Considering that every
      individual thus brings into the stock of the world so vast a share of
      intelligence, it cannot but excite our wonder to find that Oxenstiern is
      popularly held to be right when he said, "See, my son, how little wisdom
      it requires to govern States,"&mdash;that is, Men! That so many millions
      of persons, each with a profound assurance that he is possessed of an
      exalted sagacity, should concur in the ascendancy of a few inferior
      intellects, according to a few stupid, prosy, matter-of-fact rules as old
      as the hills, is a phenomenon very discreditable to the spirit and energy
      of the aggregate human species! It creates no surprise that one sensible
      watch-dog should control the movements of a flock of silly grass-eating
      sheep; but that two or three silly grass-eating sheep should give the law
      to whole flocks of such mighty sensible watch-dogs&mdash;Diavolo! Dr.
      Riecabocca, explain that, if you can! And wonderfully strange it is, that
      notwithstanding all the march of enlightenment, notwithstanding our
      progressive discoveries in the laws of Nature, our railways,
      steam-engines, animal magnetism, and electrobiology,&mdash;we have never
      made any improvement that is generally acknowledged, since men ceased to
      be troglodytes and nomads, in the old-fashioned gamut of flats and sharps,
      which attunes into irregular social jog-trot all the generations that pass
      from the cradle to the grave; still, "the desire for something have have
      not" impels all the energies that keep us in movement, for good or for
      ill, according to the checks or the directions of each favourite desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend of mine once said to a millionaire, whom he saw forever engaged
      in making money which he never seemed to have any pleasure in spending,
      "Pray, Mr &mdash;&mdash;, will you answer me one question: You are said to
      have two millions, and you spend L600 a year. In order to rest and enjoy,
      what will content you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little more," answered the millionaire. That "little more" is the
      mainspring of civilization. Nobody ever gets it!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philus," saith a Latin writer, "was not so rich as Laelius; Laelius was
      not so rich as Scipio; Scipio was not so rich as Crassus; and Crassus was
      not so rich&mdash;as he wished to be!" If John Bull were once contented,
      Manchester might shut up its mills. It is the "little more" that makes a
      mere trifle of the National Debt!&mdash;Long life to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, mend our law-books as we will, one is forced to confess that knaves
      are often seen in fine linen, and honest men in the most shabby old rags;
      and still, notwithstanding the exceptions, knavery is a very hazardous
      game, and honesty, on the whole, by far the best policy. Still, most of
      the Ten Commandments remain at the core of all the Pandects and Institutes
      that keep our hands off our neighbours' throats, wives, and pockets;
      still, every year shows that the parson's maxim&mdash;"non quieta movere "&mdash;is
      as prudent for the health of communities as when Apollo recommended his
      votaries not to rake up a fever by stirring the Lake Camarina; still,
      people, thank Heaven, decline to reside in parallelograms, and the surest
      token that we live under a free government is when we are governed by
      persons whom we have a full right to imply, by our censure and ridicule,
      are blockheads compared to ourselves! Stop that delightful privilege, and,
      by Jove! sir, there is neither pleasure nor honour in being governed at
      all! You might as well be&mdash;a Frenchman!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The Italian and his friend are closeted together.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "And why have you left your home in &mdash;&mdash;-shire, and why this new
      change of name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peschiera is in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And bent on discovering me; and, it is said, of stealing from me my
      child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has had the assurance to lay wagers that he will win the hand of your
      heiress. I know that too; and therefore I have come to England,&mdash;first
      to baffle his design&mdash;for I do not think your fears altogether
      exaggerated,&mdash;and next to learn from you how to follow up a clew
      which, unless I am too sanguine, may lead to his ruin, and your
      unconditional restoration. Listen to me. You are aware that, after the
      skirmish with Peschiera's armed hirelings sent in search of you, I
      received a polite message from the Austrian government, requesting me to
      leave its Italian domains. Now, as I hold it the obvious duty of any
      foreigner admitted to the hospitality of a State, to refrain from all
      participation in its civil disturbances, so I thought my honour assailed
      at this intimation, and went at once to Vienna, to explain to the minister
      there (to whom I was personally known), that though I had, as became man
      to man, aided to protect a refugee, who had taken shelter under my roof,
      from the infuriated soldiers at the command of his private foe, I had not
      only not shared in any attempt at revolt, but dissuaded, as far as I
      could, my Italian friends from their enterprise; and that because, without
      discussing its merits, I believed, as a military man and a cool spectator,
      the enterprise could only terminate in fruitless bloodshed. I was enabled
      to establish my explanation by satisfactory proof; and my acquaintance
      with the minister assumed something of the character of friendship. I was
      then in a position to advocate your cause, and to state your original
      reluctance to enter into the plots of the insurgents. I admitted freely
      that you had such natural desire for the independence of your native land,
      that, had the standard of Italy been boldly hoisted by its legitimate
      chiefs, or at the common uprising of its whole people, you would have been
      found in the van, amidst the ranks of your countrymen; but I maintained
      that you would never have shared in a conspiracy frantic in itself, and
      defiled by the lawless schemes and sordid ambition of its main projectors,
      had you not been betrayed and decoyed into it by the misrepresentations
      and domestic treachery of your kinsman,&mdash;the very man who denounced
      you. Unfortunately, of this statement I had no proof but your own word. I
      made, however, so far an impression in your favour, and, it may be,
      against the traitor, that your property was not confiscated to the State,
      nor handed over, upon the plea of your civil death, to your kinsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How!&mdash;I do not understand. Peschiera has the property?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He holds the revenues but of one half upon pleasure, and they would be
      withdrawn, could I succeed in establishing the case that exists against
      him. I was forbidden before to mention this to you; the minister, not
      inexcusably, submitted you to the probation of unconditional exile. Your
      grace might depend upon your own forbearance from further conspiracies&mdash;forgive
      the word. I need not say I was permitted to return to Lombardy. I found,
      on my arrival, that&mdash;that your unhappy wife had been to my house, and
      exhibited great despair at hearing of my departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca knit his dark brows, and breathed hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not judge it necessary to acquaint you with this circumstance, nor
      did it much affect me. I believed in her guilt&mdash;and what could now
      avail her remorse, if remorse she felt? Shortly afterwards, I heard that
      she was no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," muttered Riccabocca, "she died in the same year that I left Italy.
      It must be a strong reason that can excuse a friend for reminding me even
      that she once lived!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come at once to that reason," said L'Estrange, gently. "This autumn I
      was roaming through Switzerland, and, in one of my pedestrian excursions
      amidst the mountains, I met with an accident, which confined me for some
      days to a sofa at a little inn in an obscure village. My hostess was an
      Italian; and as I had left my servant at a town at some distance, I
      required her attention till I could write to him to come to me. I was
      thankful for her cares, and amused by her Italian babble. We became very
      good friends. She told me she had been servant to a lady of great rank,
      who had died in Switzerland; and that, being enriched by the generosity of
      her mistress, she had married a Swiss innkeeper, and his people had become
      hers. My servant arrived, and my hostess learned my name, which she did
      not know before. She came into my room greatly agitated. In brief, this
      woman had been servant to your wife. She had accompanied her to my villa,
      and known of her anxiety to see me, as your friend. The Government had
      assigned to your wife your palace at Milan, with a competent income. She
      had refused to accept of either. Failing to see me, she had set off
      towards England, resolved upon seeing yourself; for the journals had
      stated that to England you had escaped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She dared! shameless! And see, but a moment before, I had forgotten all
      but her grave in a foreign soil,&mdash;and these tears had forgiven her,"
      murmured the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them forgive her still," said Harley, with all his exquisite
      sweetness of look and tone. "I resume. On entering Switzerland your wife's
      health, which you know was always delicate, gave way. To fatigue and
      anxiety succeeded fever, and delirium ensued. She had taken with her but
      this one female attendant&mdash;the sole one she could trust&mdash;on
      leaving home. She suspected Peschiera to have bribed her household. In the
      presence of this woman she raved of her innocence, in accents of terror
      and aversion denounced your kinsman, and called on you to vindicate her
      name and your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ravings indeed! Poor Paulina!" groaned Riccabocca, covering his face with
      both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in her delirium there were lucid intervals. In one of these she rose,
      in spite of all her servants could do to restrain her, took from her desk
      several letters, and reading them over, exclaimed piteously, 'But how to
      get them to him; whom to trust? And his friend is gone!' Then an idea
      seemed suddenly to flash upon her, for she uttered a joyous exclamation,
      sat down, and wrote long and rapidly, enclosed what she wrote with all the
      letters, in one packet, which she sealed carefully, and bade her servant
      carry to the post, with many injunctions to take it with her own hand, and
      pay the charge on it. 'For oh!' said she (I repeat the words as my
      informant told them to me),&mdash;'for oh! this is my sole chance to prove
      to my husband that, though I have erred, I am not the guilty thing he
      believes me; the sole chance, too, to redeem my error, and restore,
      perhaps, to my husband his country, to my child her heritage.' The servant
      took the letter to the post; and when she returned, her lady was asleep,
      with a smile upon her face. But from that sleep she woke again delirious,
      and before the next morning her soul had fled." Here Riccabocca lifted one
      hand from his face and grasped Harley's arm, as if mutely beseeching him
      to pause. The heart of the man struggled hard with his pride and his
      philosophy; and it was long before Harley could lead him to regard the
      worldly prospects which this last communication from his wife might open
      to his ruined fortunes,&mdash;not, indeed, till Riccabocca had persuaded
      himself, and half persuaded Harley (for strong, indeed, was all
      presumption of guilt against the dead), that his wife's protestations of
      innocence from all but error had been but ravings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be this as it may," said Harley, "there seems every reason to suppose
      that the letters enclosed were Peschiera's correspondence, and that, if
      so, these would establish the proof of his influence over your wife, and
      of his perfidious machinations against yourself. I resolved, before coming
      hither, to go round by Vienna. There I heard, with dismay, that Peschiera
      had not only obtained the imperial sanction to demand your daughter's
      hand, but had boasted to his profligate circle that he should succeed; and
      he was actually on his road to England. I saw at once that could this
      design, by any fraud or artifice, be successful with Violante (for of your
      consent, I need not say, I did not dream), the discovery of the packet,
      whatever its contents, would be useless; Peschiera's end would be secured.
      I saw also that his success would suffice forever to clear his name; for
      his success must imply your consent (it would be to disgrace your
      daughter, to assert that she had married without it), and your consent
      would be his acquittal. I saw, too, with alarm, that to all means for the
      accomplishment of his project he would be urged by despair; for his debts
      are great, and his character nothing but new wealth can support. I knew
      that he was able, bold, determined, and that he had taken with him a large
      supply of money borrowed upon usury,&mdash;in a word, I trembled for you
      both. I have now seen your daughter, and I tremble no more. Accomplished
      seducer as Peschiera boasts himself, the first look upon her face so
      sweet, yet so noble, convinced me that she is proof against a legion of
      Peschieras. Now, then, return we to this all-important subject,&mdash;to
      this packet. It never reached you. Long years have passed since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it exist still? Into whose hands would it have fallen?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try to summon up all your recollections. The servant could not remember
      the name of the person to whom it was addressed; she only insisted that
      the name began with a B, that it was directed to England, and that to
      England she accordingly paid the postage. Whom then, with a name that
      begins with B, or (in case the servant's memory here mislead her) whom did
      you or your wife know, during your visit to England, with sufficient
      intimacy to make it probable that she would select such a person for her
      confidant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot conceive," said Riccabocca, shaking his head. "We came to
      England shortly after our marriage. Paulina was affected by the climate.
      She spoke not a word of English, and indeed not even French, as might have
      been expected from her birth, for her father was poor, and thoroughly
      Italian. She refused all society. I went, it is true, somewhat into the
      London world,&mdash;enough to induce me to shrink from the contrast that
      my second visit as a beggared refugee would have made to the reception I
      met with on my first; but I formed no intimate friendships. I recall no
      one whom she could have written to as intimate with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," persisted Harley, "think again. Was there no lady well acquainted
      with Italian, and with whom, perhaps, for that very reason, your wife
      became familiar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it is true. There was one old lady of retired habits, but who had
      been much in Italy. Lady&mdash;Lady&mdash;I remember&mdash;Lady Jane
      Horton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horton&mdash;Lady Jane!" exclaimed Harley; "again; thrice in one day!&mdash;is
      this wound never to scar over?" Then, noting Riccabocca's look of
      surprise, he said, "Excuse me, my friend; I listen to you with renewed
      interest. Lady Jane was a distant relation of my own; she judged me,
      perhaps, harshly&mdash;and I have some painful associations with her name;
      but she was a woman of many virtues. Your wife knew her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not, however, intimately; still, better than any one else in London. But
      Paulina would not have written to her; she knew that Lady Jane had died
      shortly after her own departure from England. I myself was summoned back
      to Italy on pressing business; she was too unwell to journey with me as
      rapidly as I was obliged to travel; indeed, illness detained her several
      weeks in England. In this interval she might have made acquaintances. Ah,
      now I see; I guess. You say the name began with B. Paulina, in my absence,
      engaged a companion,&mdash;a Mrs. Bertram. This lady accompanied her
      abroad. Paulina became excessively attached to her, she knew Italian so
      well. Mrs. Bertram left her on the road, and returned to England, for some
      private affairs of her own. I forget why or wherefore; if, indeed, I ever
      asked or learned. Paulina missed her sadly, often talked of her, wondered
      why she never heard from her. No doubt it was to this Mrs. Bertram that
      she wrote!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you don't know the lady's friends, or address?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor who recommended her to your wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably Lady Jane Horton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will follow up this track, slight as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if Mrs. Bertram received the communication, how comes it that it
      never reached myself&mdash;Oh, fool that I am, how should it! I, who
      guarded so carefully my incognito!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. This your wife could not foresee; she would naturally imagine that
      your residence in England would be easily discovered. But many years must
      have passed since your wife lost sight of this Mrs. Bertram, if their
      acquaintance was made so soon after your marriage; and now it is a long
      time to retrace,&mdash;before even your Violante was born."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! yes. I lost two fair sons in the interval. Violante was born to me
      as the child of sorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to make sorrow lovely! how beautiful she is!" The father smiled
      proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where, in the loftiest houses of Europe, find a husband worthy of such a
      prize?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget that I am still an exile, she still dowerless. You forget that
      I am pursued by Peschiera; that I would rather see her a beggar's wife&mdash;than&mdash;Pah,
      the very thought maddens me, it is so foul. Corpo di Bacco! I have been
      glad to find her a husband already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Already! Then that young man spoke truly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Randal Leslie. How! You know him?" Here a brief explanation followed.
      Harley heard with attentive ear, and marked vexation, the particulars of
      Riccabocca's connection and implied engagement with Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something very suspicious to me in all this," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should this young man have so sounded me as to Violante's chance of
      losing fortune if she married, an Englishman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he? Oh, pooh! Excuse him. It was but his natural wish to seem
      ignorant of all about me. He did not know enough of my intimacy with you
      to betray my secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he knew enough of it&mdash;must have known enough&mdash;to have made
      it right that he should tell you I was in England. He does not seem to
      have done so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that is strange&mdash;yet scarcely strange; for, when we last met,
      his head was full of other things,&mdash;love and marriage. Basta! youth
      will be youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has no youth left in him!" exclaimed Harley, passionately. "I doubt if
      he ever had any. He is one of those men who come into the world with the
      pulse of a centenarian. You and I never shall be as old as he was in long
      clothes. Ah, you may laugh; but I am never wrong in my instincts. I
      disliked him at the first,&mdash;his eye, his smile, his voice, his very
      footstep. It is madness in you to countenance such a marriage; it may
      destroy all chance of your restoration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better that than infringe my word once passed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," exclaimed Harley; "your word is not passed, it shall not be
      passed. Nay, never look so piteously at me. At all events, pause till we
      know more of this young man. If he be worthy of her without a dower, why,
      then, let him lose you your heritage. I should have no more to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why lose me my heritage? There is no law in Austria which can dictate
      to a father what husband to choose for his daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not. But you are out of the pale of law itself just at present;
      and it would surely be a reason for State policy to withhold your pardon,
      and it would be to the loss of that favour with your own countrymen, which
      would now make that pardon so popular, if it were known that the
      representative of your name were debased by your daughter's alliance with
      an English adventurer,&mdash;a clerk in a public office. Oh, sage in
      theory, why are you such a simpleton in action?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing moved by this taunt, Riceabocca rubbed his hands, and then
      stretched them comfortably over the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend," said he, "the representation of my name would pass to my
      son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have no son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! I am going to have one; my Jemima informed me of it yesterday
      morning; and it was upon that information that I resolved to speak to
      Leslie. Am I a simpleton now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to have a son," repeated Harley, looking very bewildered; "how do
      you know it is to be a son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Physiologists are agreed," said the sage, positively, "that where the
      husband is much older than the wife, and there has been a long interval
      without children before she condescends to increase the population of the
      world, she (that is, it is at least as nine to four)&mdash;she brings into
      the world a male. I consider that point therefore as settled, according to
      the calculations of statisticians and the researches of naturalists."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley could not help laughing, though he was still angry and disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same man as ever; always the fool of philosophy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cospetto!" said Riccabocca. "I am rather the philosopher of fools. And
      talking of that, shall I present you to my Jemima?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but in turn I must present you to one who remembers with gratitude
      your kindness, and whom your philosophy, for a wonder, has not ruined.
      Some time or other you must explain that to me. Excuse me for a moment; I
      will go for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For him,&mdash;for whom? In my position I must be cautious; and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer for his faith and discretion. Meanwhile order dinner, and
      let me and my friend stay to share it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner? Corpo di Bacco!&mdash;not that Bacchus can help us here. What
      will Jemima say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henpecked man, settle that with your connubial tyrant. But dinner it must
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      I leave the reader to imagine the delight of Leonard at seeing once more
      Riccabocca unchanged and Violante so improved, and the kind Jemima too;
      and their wonder at him and his history, his books and his fame. He
      narrated his struggles and adventures with a simplicity that removed from
      a story so personal the character of egotism. But when he came to speak of
      Helen he was brief and reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante would have questioned more closely; but, to Leonard's relief,
      Harley interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall see her whom he speaks of before long, and question her
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Harley turned the young man's narrative into new
      directions; and Leonard's words again flowed freely. Thus the evening
      passed away happily to all save Riccabocca. For the thought of his dead
      wife rose ever and anon before the exile; but when it did, and became too
      painful, he crept nearer to Jemima, and looked in her simple face, and
      pressed her cordial hand. And yet the monster had implied to Harley that
      his comforter was a fool,&mdash;so she was, to love so contemptible a
      slanderer of herself and her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante was in a state of blissful excitement; she could not analyze her
      own joy. But her conversation was chiefly with Leonard; and the most
      silent of all was Harley. He sat listening to Leonard's warm yet
      unpretending eloquence,&mdash;that eloquence which flows so naturally from
      genius, when thoroughly at its ease, and not chilled back on itself by
      hard, unsympathizing hearers; listened, yet more charmed, to the
      sentiments less profound, yet no less earnest,&mdash;sentiments so
      feminine, yet so noble, with which Violante's fresh virgin heart responded
      to the poet's kindling soul. Those sentiments of hers were so unlike all
      he heard in the common world, so akin to himself in his gone youth!
      Occasionally&mdash;at some high thought of her own, or some lofty line
      from Italian song, that she cited with lighted eyes, and in melodious
      accents&mdash;occasionally he reared his knightly head, and his lip
      quivered, as if he had heard the sound of a trumpet. The inertness of long
      years was shaken. The Heroic, that lay deep beneath all the humours of his
      temperament, was reached, appealed to; and stirred within him, rousing up
      all the bright associations connected with it, and long dormant. When he
      arose to take leave, surprised at the lateness of the hour, Harley said,
      in a tone that bespoke the sincerity of the compliment, "I thank you for
      the happiest hours I have known for years." His eye dwelt on Violante as
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      But timidity returned to her with his words, at his look; and it was no
      longer the inspired muse, but the bashful girl that stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when shall I see you again?" asked Riccabocca, disconsolately,
      following his guest to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When? Why, of course, to-morrow. Adieu! my friend. No wonder you have
      borne your exile so patiently,&mdash;with such a child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Leonard's arm, and walked with him to the inn where he had left
      his horse. Leonard spoke of Violante with enthusiasm. Harley was silent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day a somewhat old-fashioned, but exceedingly patrician, equipage
      stopped at Riccabocca's garden-gate. Giacomo, who, from a bedroom window,
      had caught sight of its winding towards the house, was seized with
      undefinable terror when he beheld it pause before their walls, and heard
      the shrill summons at the portal. He rushed into his master's presence,
      and implored him not to stir,&mdash;not to allow any one to give ingress
      to the enemies the machine might disgorge. "I have heard," said he, "how a
      town in Italy&mdash;I think it was Bologna&mdash;was once taken and given
      to the sword, by incautiously admitting a wooden horse full of the troops
      of Barbarossa and all manner of bombs and Congreve rockets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The story is differently told in Virgil," quoth Riccabocca, peeping out
      of the window. "Nevertheless, the machine looks very large and suspicious;
      unloose Pompey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," said Violante, colouring, "it is your friend, Lord L'Estrange; I
      hear his voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite. How can I be mistaken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, then, Giacomo; but take Pompey with thee,&mdash;and give the alarm if
      we are deceived."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Violante was right; and in a few moments Lord L'Estrange was seen
      walking up the garden, and giving the arm to two ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Riccabocca, composing his dressing-robe round him, "go, my
      child, and summon Jemima. Man to man; but, for Heaven's sake, woman to
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley had brought his mother and Helen, in compliment to the ladies of
      his friend's household.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proud countess knew that she was in the presence of Adversity, and her
      salute to Riccabocca was only less respectful than that with which she
      would have rendered homage to her sovereign. But Riccabocca, always
      gallant to the sex that he pretended to despise, was not to be outdone in
      ceremony; and the bow which replied to the courtesy would have edified the
      rising generation, and delighted such surviving relics of the old Court
      breeding as may linger yet amidst the gloomy pomp of the Faubourg St.
      Germain. These dues paid to etiquette, the countess briefly introduced
      Helen as Miss Digby, and seated herself near the exile. In a few moments
      the two elder personages became quite at home with each other; and,
      really, perhaps Riccabocca had never, since we have known him, showed to
      such advantage as by the side of his polished, but somewhat formal
      visitor. Both had lived so little with our modern, ill-bred age! They took
      out their manners of a former race, with a sort of pride in airing once
      more such fine lace and superb brocade. Riccabocca gave truce to the
      shrewd but homely wisdom of his proverbs, perhaps he remembered that Lord
      Chesterfield denounces proverbs as vulgar; and gaunt though his figure,
      and far from elegant though his dressing-robe, there was that about him
      which spoke undeniably of the grand seigneur,&mdash;of one to whom a
      Marquis de Dangeau would have offered a fauteuil by the side of the Rohans
      and Montmorencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Helen and Harley seated themselves a little apart, and were both
      silent,&mdash;the first, from timidity; the second, from abstraction. At
      length the door opened, and Harley suddenly sprang to his feet,&mdash;Violante
      and Jemima entered. Lady Lansinere's eyes first rested on the daughter,
      and she could scarcely refrain from an exclamation of admiring surprise;
      but then, when she caught sight of Mrs. Riccabocca's somewhat humble, yet
      not obsequious mien,&mdash;looking a little shy, a little homely, yet
      still thoroughly a gentlewoman (though of your plain, rural kind of that
      genus), she turned from the daughter, and with the savoir vivre of the
      fine old school, paid her first respects to the wife; respects literally,
      for her manner implied respect,&mdash;but it was more kind, simple, and
      cordial than the respect she had shown to Riccabocca; as the sage himself
      had said, here "it was Woman to Woman." And then she took Violante's hand
      in both hers, and gazed on her as if she could not resist the pleasure of
      contemplating so much beauty. "My son," she said softly, and with a half
      sigh,&mdash;"my son in vain told me not to be surprised. This is the first
      time I have ever known reality exceed description!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante's blush here made her still more beautiful; and as the countess
      returned to Riccabocca, she stole gently to Helen's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Digby, my ward," said Harley, pointedly, observing that his mother
      had neglected her duty of presenting Helen to the ladies. He then reseated
      himself, and conversed with Mrs. Riccabocca; but his bright, quick eye
      glanced over at the two girls. They were about the same age&mdash;and
      youth was all that, to the superficial eye, they seemed to have in common.
      A greater contrast could not well be conceived; and, what is strange, both
      gained by it. Violante's brilliant loveliness seemed yet more dazzling,
      and Helen's fair, gentle face yet more winning. Neither had mixed much
      with girls of her own age; each took to the other at first sight.
      Violante, as the less shy, began the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are his ward,&mdash;Lord L'Estrange's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you came with him from Italy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not exactly; but I have been in Italy for some years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you regret&mdash;nay, I am foolish&mdash;you return to your native
      land. But the skies in Italy are so blue,&mdash;here it seems as if Nature
      wanted colours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange says that you were very young when you left Italy; you
      remember it well. He, too, prefers Italy to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He! Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why impossible, fair sceptic?" cried Harley, interrupting himself in the
      midst of a speech to Jemima.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante had not dreamed that she could be overheard&mdash;she was
      speaking low; but, though visibly embarrassed, she answered distinctly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because in England there is the noblest career for noble minds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was startled, and replied, with a slight sigh, "At your age I
      should have said as you do. But this England of ours is so crowded with
      noble minds that they only jostle each other, and the career is one cloud
      of dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, I have read, seems a battle to a common soldier, but not to the
      chief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have read good descriptions of battles, I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Riccabocca, who thought this remark a taunt upon her step-daughter's
      studies, hastened to Violante's relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her papa made her read the history of Italy, and I believe that is full
      of battles."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"All history is, and all women are fond of war and of
      warriors. I wonder why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE (turning to Helen, and in a very low voice, resolved that Harley
      should not hear this time).&mdash;"We can guess why,&mdash;can we not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (hearing every word, as if it had been spoken in St. Paul's
      Whispering Gallery).&mdash;"If you can guess, Helen, pray tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (shaking her pretty head, and answering with a livelier smile than
      usual).&mdash;"But I am not fond of war and warriors."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (to Violante).&mdash;"Then I must appeal at once to you,
      self-convicted Bellona that you are. Is it from the cruelty natural to the
      female disposition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE (with a sweet musical laugh). "From two propensities still more
      natural to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"YOU puzzle me: what can they be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"Pity and admiration; we pity the weak and admire the
      brave."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley inclined his head, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lansmere had suspended her conversation with Riccabocca to listen to
      this dialogue. "Charming!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have explained what has often perplexed me. Ah, Harley, I am glad to
      see that your satire is foiled: you have no reply to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I willingly own myself defeated, too glad to claim the signorina's
      pity, since my cavalry sword hangs on the wall, and I can have no longer a
      professional pretence to her admiration."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then rose, and glanced towards the window. "But I see a more formidable
      disputant for my conqueror to encounter is coming into the field,&mdash;one
      whose profession it is to substitute some other romance for that of camp
      and siege."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our friend Leonard," said Riccabocca, turning his eye also towards the
      window. "True; as Quevedo says, wittily, 'Ever since there has been so
      great a demand for type, there has been much less lead to spare for
      cannon-balls.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Leonard entered. Harley had sent Lady Lansmere's footman to him with
      a note, that prepared him to meet Helen. As he came into the room, Harley
      took him by the hand and led him to Lady Lansmere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The friend of whom I spoke. Welcome him now for my sake, ever after for
      his own;" and then, scarcely allowing time for the countess's elegant and
      gracious response, he drew Leonard towards Helen. "Children," said he,
      with a touching voice, that thrilled through the hearts of both, "go and
      seat yourselves yonder, and talk together of the past. Signorina, I invite
      you to renewed discussion upon the abstruse metaphysical subject you have
      started; let us see if we cannot find gentler sources for pity and
      admiration than war and warriors." He took Violante aside to the window.
      "You remember that Leonard, in telling you his history last night, spoke,
      you thought, rather too briefly of the little girl who had been his
      companion in the rudest time of his trials. When you would have questioned
      more, I interrupted you, and said, 'You should see her shortly, and
      question her yourself.' And now what think you of Helen Digby? Hush, speak
      low. But her ears are not so sharp as mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"Ah! that is the fair creature whom Leonard called his
      child-angel? What a lovely innocent face!&mdash;the angel is there still."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (pleased both at the praise and with her who gave it).&mdash;"You
      think so; and you are right. Helen is not communicative. But fine natures
      are like fine poems,&mdash;a glance at the first two lines suffices for a
      guess into the beauty that waits you if you read on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante gazed on Leonard and Helen as they sat apart. Leonard was the
      speaker, Helen the listener; and though the former had, in his narrative
      the night before, been indeed brief as to the episode in his life
      connected with the orphan, enough had been said to interest Violante in
      the pathos of their former position towards each other, and in the
      happiness they must feel in their meeting again,&mdash;separated for years
      on the wide sea of life, now both saved from the storm and shipwreck. The
      tears came into her eyes. "True," she said, very softly, "there is more
      here to move pity and admiration than in&mdash;" She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Complete the sentence. Are you ashamed to retract? Fie on
      your pride and obstinacy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"No; but even here there have been war and heroism,&mdash;the
      war of genius with adversity, and heroism in the comforter who shared it
      and consoled. Ah, wherever pity and admiration are both felt, something
      nobler than mere sorrow must have gone before: the heroic must exist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen does not know what the word 'heroic' means," said Harley, rather
      sadly; "you must teach her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," thought he as he spoke, "that a Randal Leslie could have
      charmed this grand creature? No 'Heroic' surely, in that sleek young
      placeman.&mdash;Your father," he said aloud, and fixing his eyes on her
      face, "sees much, he tells me, of a young man about Leonard's age, as to
      date; but I never estimate the age of men by the parish register, and I
      should speak of that so-called young man as a contemporary of my
      great-grandfather,&mdash;I mean Mr. Randal Leslie. Do you like him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like him," said Violante, slowly, and as if sounding her own mind,&mdash;"like
      him&mdash;yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Harley, with dry and curt indignation. "His visits seem to
      please my dear father. Certainly I like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum. He professes to like you, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante laughed unsuspiciously. She had half a mind to reply, "Is that so
      strange?" But her respect for Harley stopped her. The words would have
      seemed to her pert. "I am told he is clever," resumed Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he is rather handsome. But I like Leonard's face better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better&mdash;that is not the word. Leonard's face is as that of one who
      has gazed so often upon Heaven; and Mr. Leslie's&mdash;there is neither
      sunlight nor starlight reflected there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Violante?" exclaimed Harley, overjoyed; and he pressed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed over the girl's cheek and brow; her hand trembled in his.
      But Harley's familiar exclamation might have come from a father's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Helen softly approached them, and looking timidly into her
      guardian's face, said, "Leonard's mother is with him: he asks me to call
      and see her. May I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May you! A pretty notion the signorina must form of your enslaved state
      of pupilage, when she hears you ask that question. Of course you may."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come with us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley looked embarrassed. He thought of the widow's agitation at his
      name; of that desire to shun him, which Leonard had confessed, and of
      which he thought he divined the cause. And so divining, he too shrank from
      such a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another time, then," said he, after a pause. Helen looked disappointed,
      but said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante was surprised at this ungracious answer. She would have blamed it
      as unfeeling in another; but all that Harley did was right in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannot I go with Miss Digby?" said she, "and my mother will go too. We
      both know Mrs. Fairfield. We shall be so pleased to see her again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So be it," said Harley; "I will wait here with your father till you come
      back. Oh, as to my mother, she will excuse the&mdash;excuse Madame
      Riccabocca, and you too. See how charmed she is with your father. I must
      stay to watch over the conjugal interests of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Riccabocca had too much good old country breeding to leave the
      countess; and Harley was forced himself to appeal to Lady Lansmere. When
      he had explained the case in point, the countess rose and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I will call myself, with Miss Digby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Harley, gravely, but in a whisper. "No; I would rather not. I
      will explain later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said the countess aloud, after a glance of surprise at her son, "I
      must insist on your performing this visit, my dear madam, and you,
      Signorina. In truth, I have something to say confidentially to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me," interrupted Riccabocca. "Ah, Madame la Comtesse, you restore me
      to five-and-twenty. Go, quick, O jealous and injured wife; go, both of
      you, quick; and you, too, Harley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said Lady Lansmere, in the same tone, "Harley must stay, for my
      design is not at present upon destroying your matrimonial happiness,
      whatever it may be later. It is a design so innocent that my son will be a
      partner in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the countess put her lips to Harley's ear, and whispered. He received
      her communication in attentive silence; but when she had done, pressed her
      hand, and bowed his head, as if in assent to a proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the three ladies and Leonard were on their road to the
      neighbouring cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante, with her usual delicate intuition, thought that Leonard and
      Helen must have much to say to each other; and (ignorant, as Leonard
      himself was, of Helen's engagement to Harley) began already, in the
      romance natural to her age, to predict for them happy and united days in
      the future. So she took her stepmother's arm, and left Helen and Leonard
      to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," she said musingly, "how Miss Digby became Lord L'Estrange's
      ward. I hope she is not very rich, nor very high-born."
    </p>
    <p>
      "La, my love," said the good Jemima, "that is not like you; you are not
      envious of her, poor girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Envious! Dear mamma, what a word! But don't you think Leonard and Miss
      Digby seem born for each other? And then the recollections of their
      childhood&mdash;the thoughts of childhood are so deep, and its memories so
      strangely soft!" The long lashes drooped over Violante's musing eyes as
      she spoke. "And therefore," she said, after a pause,&mdash;"therefore I
      hoped that Miss Digby might not be very rich nor very high-born."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you now, Violante," exclaimed Jemima, her own early passion
      for match-making instantly returning to her; "for as Leonard, however
      clever and distinguished, is still the son of Mark Fairfield the
      carpenter, it would spoil all if&mdash;Miss Digby was, as you say, rich
      and high-born. I agree with you,&mdash;a very pretty match, a very pretty
      match, indeed. I wish dear&mdash;Mrs. Dale were here now,&mdash;she is so
      clever in settling such matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Leonard and Helen walked side by side a few paces in the rear.
      He had not offered her his arm. They had been silent hitherto since they
      left Riccabocca's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen now spoke first. In similar cases it is generally the woman, be she
      ever so timid, who does speak first. And here Helen was the bolder; for
      Leonard did not disguise from himself the nature of his feelings, and
      Helen was engaged to another, and her pure heart was fortified by the
      trust reposed in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you ever heard more of the good Dr. Morgan, who had powders
      against sorrow, and who meant to be so kind to us,&mdash;though," she
      added, colouring, "we did not think so then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He took my child-angel from me," said Leonard, with visible emotion; "and
      if she had not returned, where and what should I be now? But I have
      forgiven him. No, I have never met him since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that terrible Mr. Burley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor, poor Burley! He, too, is vanished out of my present life. I have
      made many inquiries after him; all I can hear is that he went abroad,
      supposed as a correspondent to some journal. I should like so much to see
      him again, now that perhaps I could help him as he helped me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helped you&mdash;ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard smiled with a beating heart, as he saw again the dear prudent,
      warning look, and involuntarily drew closer to Helen. She seemed more
      restored to him and to her former self.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helped me much by his instructions; more, perhaps, by his very faults.
      You cannot guess, Helen,&mdash;I beg pardon, Miss Digby, but I forgot that
      we are no longer children,&mdash;you cannot guess how much we men, and
      more than all, perhaps, we writers whose task it is to unravel the web of
      human actions, owe even to our own past errors; and if we learned nothing
      by the errors of others, we should be dull indeed. We must know where the
      roads divide, and have marked where they lead to, before we can erect our
      sign-post; and books are the sign-posts in human life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Books! and I have not yet read yours. And Lord L'Estrange tells me you
      are famous now. Yet you remember me still,&mdash;the poor orphan child,
      whom you first saw weeping at her father's grave, and with whom you
      burdened your own young life, over-burdened already. No, still call me
      Helen&mdash;you must always be to me a brother! Lord L'Estrange feels
      that; he said so to me when he told me that we were to meet again. He is
      so generous, so noble. Brother!" cried Helen, suddenly, and extending her
      hand, with a sweet but sublime look in her gentle face,&mdash;"brother, we
      will never forfeit his esteem; we will both do our best to repay him! Will
      we not?&mdash;say so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard felt overpowered by contending and unanalyzed emotions. Touched
      almost to tears by the affectionate address, thrilled by the hand that
      pressed his own, and yet with a vague fear, a consciousness that something
      more than the words themselves was implied,&mdash;something that checked
      all hope. And this word "brother," once so precious and so dear, why did
      he shrink from it now; why could he not too say the sweet word "sister"?
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is above me now and evermore!" he thought mournfully; and the tones
      of his voice, when he spoke again, were changed. The appeal to renewed
      intimacy but made him more distant, and to that appeal itself he made no
      direct answer; for Mrs. Riccabocca, now turning round, and pointing to the
      cottage which came in view, with its picturesque gable-ends, cried out,
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is that your house, Leonard? I never saw anything so pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not remember it then," said Leonard to Helen, in accents of
      melancholy reproach,&mdash;"there where I saw you last? I doubted whether
      to keep it exactly as it was, and I said, '&mdash;No! the association is
      not changed because we try to surround it with whatever beauty we can
      create; the dearer the association, the more the Beautiful becomes to it
      natural.' Perhaps you don't understand this,&mdash;perhaps it is only we
      poor poets who do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand it," said Helen, gently. She looked wistfully at the
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So changed! I have so often pictured it to myself, never, never like
      this; yet I loved it, commonplace as it was to my recollection; and the
      garret, and the tree in the carpenter's yard."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not give these thoughts utterance. And they now entered the
      garden.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fairfield was a proud woman when she received Mrs. Riccabocca and
      Violante in her grand house; for a grand house to her was that cottage to
      which her boy Lenny had brought her home. Proud, indeed, ever was Widow
      Fairfield; but she thought then in her secret heart, that if ever she
      could receive in the drawing-room of that grand house the great Mrs.
      Hazeldean, who had so lectured her for refusing to live any longer in the
      humble, tenement rented of the squire, the cup of human bliss would be
      filled, and she could contentedly die of the pride of it. She did not much
      notice Helen,&mdash;her attention was too absorbed by the ladies who
      renewed their old acquaintance with her, and she carried them all over the
      house, yea, into the very kitchen; and so, somehow or other, there was a
      short time when Helen and Leonard found themselves alone. It was in the
      study. Helen had unconsciously seated herself in Leonard's own chair, and
      she was gazing with anxious and wistful interest on the scattered papers,
      looking so disorderly (though, in truth, in that disorder there was
      method, but method only known to the owner), and at the venerable
      well-worn books, in all languages, lying on the floor, on the chairs&mdash;anywhere.
      I must confess that Helen's first tidy womanlike idea was a great desire
      to arrange the litter. "Poor Leonard," she thought to herself, "the rest
      of the house so neat, but no one to take care of his own room and of him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As if he divined her thought, Leonard smiled and said, "It would be a
      cruel kindness to the spider, if the gentlest band in the world tried to
      set its cobweb to rights."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"You were not quite so bad in the old days."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"Yet even then you were obliged to take care of the money.
      I have more books now, and more money. My present housekeeper lets me take
      care of the books, but she is less indulgent as to the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (archly).&mdash;"Are you as absent as ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"Much more so, I fear. The habit is incorrigible, Miss
      Digby&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"Not Miss Digby; sister, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (evading the word that implied so forbidden an affinity).&mdash;"Helen,
      will you grant me a favour? Your eyes and your smile say 'yes.' Will you
      lay aside, for one minute, your shawl and bonnet? What! can you be
      surprised that I ask it? Can you not understand that I wish for one minute
      to think that you are at home again under this roof?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen cast down her eyes, and seemed troubled; then she raised them, with
      a soft angelic candour in their dovelike blue, and, as if in shelter from
      all thoughts of more warm affection, again murmured "brother," and did as
      he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there she sat, amongst the dull books, by his table, near the open
      window, her fair hair parted on her forehead, looking so good, so calm, so
      happy! Leonard wondered at his own self-command. His heart yearned to her
      with such inexpressible love, his lips so longed to murmur, "Ah, as now so
      could it be forever! Is the home too mean?" But that word "brother" was as
      a talisman between her and him. Yet she looked so at home&mdash;perhaps so
      at home she felt!&mdash;more certainly than she had yet learned to do in
      that stiff stately house in which she was soon to have a daughter's
      rights. Was she suddenly made aware of this, that she so suddenly arose,
      and with a look of alarm and distress on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;we are keeping Lady Lansmere too long," she said falteringly.
      "We must go now," and she hastily took up her shawl and bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Mrs. Fairfield entered with the visitors, and began making
      excuses for inattention to Miss Digby, whose identity with Leonard's
      child-angel she had not yet learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen received these apologies with her usual sweetness. "Nay," she said,
      "your son and I are such old friends, how could you stand on ceremony with
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old friends!" Mrs. Fairfield stared amazed, and then surveyed the fair
      speaker more curiously than she had yet done. "Pretty, nice-spoken thing,"
      thought the widow; "as nice-spoken as Miss Violante, and humbler-looking
      like,&mdash;though, as to dress, I never see anything so elegant out of a
      picter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen now appropriated Mrs. Riccabocca's arm; and, after a kind
      leave-taking with the widow, the ladies returned towards Riccabocca's
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fairfield, however, ran after them with Leonard's hat and gloves,
      which he had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Deed, boy," she said, kindly, yet scoldingly, "but there'd be no more
      fine books, if the Lord had not fixed your head on your shoulders. You
      would not think it, marm," she added to Mrs. Riccabocca, "but sin' he has
      left you, he's not the 'cute lad he was; very helpless at times, marm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen could not resist turning round, and looking at Leonard, with a sly
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow saw the smile, and catching Leonard by the arm, whispered, "But
      where before have you seen that pretty young lady? Old friends!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Mother," said Leonard, sadly, "it is a long tale; you have heard the
      beginning, who can guess the end?" and he escaped. But Helen still leaned
      on the arm of Mrs. Riccabocca, and, in the walk back, it seemed to Leonard
      as if the winter had re-settled in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he was by the side of Violante, and she spoke to him with such praise
      of Helen! Alas! it is not always so sweet as folks say to hear the praises
      of one we love. Sometimes those praises seem to ask ironically, "And what
      right hast thou to hope because thou lovest? All love her."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      No sooner had Lady Lansmere found herself alone with Riccabocca and Harley
      than she laid her hand on the exile's arm, and, addressing him by a title
      she had not before given him, and from which he appeared to shrink
      nervously, said, "Harley, in bringing me to visit you, was forced to
      reveal to me your incognito, for I should have discovered it. You may not
      remember me, in spite of your gallantry; but I mixed more in the world
      than I do now, during your first visit to England, and once sat next to
      you at dinner at Carlton House. Nay, no compliments, but listen to me.
      Harley tells me you have cause for some alarm respecting the designs of an
      audacious and unprincipled adventurer, I may call him; for adventurers are
      of all ranks. Suffer your daughter to come to me on a visit, as long as
      you please. With me, at least, she will be safe; and if you, too, and the&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, my dear madam," interrupted Riccabocca, with great vivacity; "your
      kindness overpowers me. I thank you most gratefully for your invitation to
      my child; but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," in his turn interrupted Harley, "no buts. I was not aware of my
      mother's intention when she entered this room. But since she whispered it
      to me, I have reflected on it, and am convinced that it is but a prudent
      precaution. Your retreat is known to Mr. Leslie, he is known to Peschiera.
      Grant that no indiscretion of Mr. Leslie's betray the secret; still I have
      reason to believe that the count guesses Randal's acquaintance with you.
      Audley Egerton this morning told me he had gathered that, not from the
      young man himself, but from questions put to himself by Madame di Negra;
      and Peschiera might and would set spies to track Leslie to every house
      that he visits,&mdash;might and would, still more naturally, set spies to
      track myself. Were this man an Englishman, I should laugh at his
      machinations; but he is an Italian, and has been a conspirator. What he
      could do I know not; but an assassin can penetrate into a camp, and a
      traitor can creep through closed walls to one's hearth. With my mother,
      Violante must be safe; that you cannot oppose. And why not come yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca had no reply to these arguments, so far as they affected
      Violante; indeed, they awakened the almost superstitious terror with which
      he regarded his enemy, and he consented at once that Violante should
      accept the invitation proffered. But he refused it for himself and Jemima.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To say truth," said he, simply, "I made a secret vow, on re-entering
      England, that I would associate with none who knew the rank I had formerly
      held in my own land. I felt that all my philosophy was needed to reconcile
      and habituate myself to my altered circumstances. In order to find in my
      present existence, however humble, those blessings which make all life
      noble,&mdash;dignity and peace,&mdash;it was necessary for poor, weak
      human nature wholly to dismiss the past. It would unsettle me sadly, could
      I come to your house, renew awhile, in your kindness and respect&mdash;nay,
      in the very atmosphere of your society&mdash;the sense of what I have
      been; and then (should the more than doubtful chance of recall from my
      exile fail me) to awake, and find myself for the rest of life what I am.
      And though, were I alone, I might trust myself perhaps to the danger, yet
      my wife: she is happy and contented now; would she be so, if you had once
      spoiled her for the simple position of Dr. Riccabocca's wife? Should I not
      have to listen to regrets and hopes and fears that would prick sharp
      through my thin cloak of philosophy? Even as it is, since in a moment of
      weakness I confided my secret to her, I have had 'my rank' thrown at me,&mdash;with
      a careless hand, it is true, but it hits hard nevertheless. No stone hurts
      like one taken from the ruins of one's own home; and the grander the home,
      why, the heavier the stone! Protect, dear madam, protect my daughter,
      since her father doubts his own power to do so. But&mdash;ask no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca was immovable here; and the matter was settled as he decided,
      it being agreed that Violante should be still styled but the daughter of
      Dr. Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, one word more," said Harley. "Do not confide to Mr. Leslie these
      arrangements; do not let him know where Violante is placed,&mdash;at
      least, until I authorize such confidence in him. It is sufficient excuse
      that it is no use to know unless he called to see her, and his movements,
      as I said before, may be watched. You can give the same reason to suspend
      his visits to yourself. Suffer me, meanwhile, to mature my judgment on
      this young man. In the meanwhile, also, I think that I shall have means of
      ascertaining the real nature of Peschiera's schemes. His sister has sought
      to know me; I will give her the occasion. I have heard some things of her
      in my last residence abroad, which make me believe that she cannot be
      wholly the count's tool in any schemes nakedly villanous; that she has
      some finer qualities in her than I once supposed; and that she can be won
      from his influence. It is a state of war; we will carry it into the
      enemy's camp. You will promise me, then, to refrain from all further
      confidence in Mr. Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the present, yes," said Riccabocca, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not even say that you have seen me, unless he first tell you that I am
      in England, and wish to learn your residence. I will give him full
      occasion to do so. Pish! don't hesitate; you know your own proverb&mdash;

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Violante and Jemima were both greatly surprised, as the reader may
      suppose, when they heard, on their return, the arrangements already made
      for the former. The countess insisted on taking her at once, and
      Riccabocca briefly said, "Certainly, the sooner the better." Violante was
      stunned and bewildered. Jemima hastened to make up a little bundle of
      things necessary, with many a woman's sigh that the poor wardrobe
      contained so few things befitting. But among the clothes she slipped a
      purse, containing the savings of months, perhaps of years, and with it a
      few affectionate lines, begging Violante to ask the countess to buy her
      all that was proper for her father's child. There is always something
      hurried and uncomfortable in the abrupt and unexpected withdrawal of any
      member from a quiet household. The small party broke into still smaller
      knots. Violante hung on her father, and listened vaguely to his not very
      lucid explanations. The countess approached Leonard, and, according to the
      usual mode with persons of quality addressing young authors, complimented
      him highly on the books she had not read, but which her son assured her
      were so remarkable. She was a little anxious to know where Harley had
      first met with Mr. Oran, whom he called his friend; but she was too
      highbred to inquire, or to express any wonder that rank should be friends
      with genius. She took it for granted that they had formed their
      acquaintance abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley conversed with Helen.&mdash;"You are not sorry that Violante is
      coming to us? She will be just such a companion for you as I could desire;
      of your own years too."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (ingenuously).&mdash;"It is hard to think I am not younger than she
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Why, my dear Helen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"She is so brilliant. She talks so beautifully. And I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"And you want but the habit of talking, to do justice to
      your own beautiful thoughts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked at him gratefully, but shook her head. It was a common trick
      of hers, and always when she was praised.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the preparations were made, the farewell was said, Violante was in
      the carriage by Lady Lansmere's side. Slowly moved on the stately equipage
      with its four horses and trim postilions, heraldic badges on their
      shoulders, in the style rarely seen in the neighbourhood of the
      metropolis, and now fast vanishing even amidst distant counties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca, Jemima, and Jackeymo continued to gaze after it from the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is gone," said Jackeymo, brushing his eyes with his coat-sleeve. "But
      it is a load off one's mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And another load on one's heart," murmured Riccabocca. "Don't cry,
      Jemima; it may be bad for you, and bad for him that is to come. It is
      astonishing how the humours of the mother may affect the unborn. I should
      not like to have a son who has a more than usual propensity to tears."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor philosopher tried to smile; but it was a bad attempt. He went
      slowly in, and shut himself with his books. But he could not read. His
      whole mind was unsettled. And though, like all parents, he had been
      anxious to rid himself of a beloved daughter for life, now that she was
      gone but for a while, a string seemed broken in the Music of Home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evening of the same day, as Egerton, who was to entertain a large
      party at dinner, was changing his dress, Harley walked into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton dismissed his valet by a sign, and continued his toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, my dear Harley, I have only ten minutes to give you. I expect
      one of the royal dukes, and punctuality is the stern virtue of men of
      business, and the graceful courtesy of princes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley had usually a jest for his friend's aphorisms; but he had none now.
      He laid his hand kindly on Egerton's shoulder. "Before I speak of my
      business, tell me how you are,&mdash;better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better,&mdash;nay, I am always well. Pooh! I may look a little tired,&mdash;years
      of toil will tell on the countenance. But that matters little: the period
      of life has passed with me when one cares how one looks in the glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Egerton completed his dress, and came to the hearth, standing
      there, erect and dignified as usual, still far handsomer than many a
      younger man, and with a form that seemed to have ample vigour to support
      for many a year the sad and glorious burden of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So now to your business, Harley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, I want you to present me, at the earliest
      opportunity, to Madame di Negra. You say she wished to know me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, she receives this evening. I did not mean to go; but when my
      party breaks up&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can call for me at The Travellers. Do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next, you knew Lady Jane Horton better even than I did, at least in the
      last year of her life." Harley sighed, and Egerton turned and stirred the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, did you ever see at her house, or hear her speak of, a Mrs.
      Bertram?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of whom?" said Egerton, in a hollow voice, his face still turned towards
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Mrs. Bertram; but heavens! my dear fellow, what is the matter? Are you
      ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A spasm at the heart, that is all; don't ring, I shall be better
      presently; go on talking. Mrs.&mdash;why do you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? I have hardly time to explain; but I am, as I told you, resolved on
      righting my old Italian friend, if Heaven will help me, as it ever does
      help the just when they bestir themselves; and this Mrs. Bertram is mixed
      up in my friend's affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His! How is that possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley rapidly and succinctly explained. Audley listened attentively, with
      his eyes fixed on the floor, and still seeming to labour under great
      difficulty of breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he answered, "I remember something of this Mrs.&mdash;Mrs.&mdash;Bertram.
      But your inquiries after her would be useless. I think I have heard that
      she is long since dead; nay, I am sure of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!&mdash;that is most unfortunate. But do you know any of her
      relations or friends? Can you suggest any mode of tracing this packet, if
      it came to her hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Lady Jane had scarcely any friend that I remember except my mother,
      and she knows nothing of this Mrs. Bertram. How unlucky! I think I shall
      advertise. Yet, no. I could only distinguish this Mrs. Bertram from any
      other of the same name, by stating with whom she had gone abroad, and that
      would catch the attention of Peschiera, and set him to counterwork us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what avails it?" said Egerton. "She whom you seek is no more&mdash;no
      more!" He paused, and went on rapidly: "The packet did not arrive in
      England till years after her death, was no doubt returned to the
      post-office, is destroyed long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley looked very much disappointed. Egerton went on in a sort of set,
      mechanical voice, as if not thinking of what he said, but speaking from
      the dry practical mode of reasoning which was habitual to him, and by
      which the man of the world destroys the hopes of an enthusiast. Then
      starting up at the sound of the first thundering knock at the street door,
      he said, "Hark! you must excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave you, my dear Audley. But I must again ask, Are you better now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much, much,&mdash;quite well: I will call for you,&mdash;probably between
      eleven and twelve."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If any one could be more surprised at seeing Lord L'Estrange at the house
      of Madame di Negra that evening than the fair hostess herself, it was
      Randal Leslie. Something instinctively told him that this visit threatened
      interference with whatever might be his ultimate projects in regard to
      Riccabocca and Violante. But Randal Leslie was not one of those who shrink
      from an intellectual combat. On the contrary, he was too confident of his
      powers of intrigue not to take a delight in their exercise. He could not
      conceive that the indolent Harley could be a match for his own restless
      activity and dogged perseverance. But in a very few moments fear crept on
      him. No man of his day could produce a more brilliant effect than Lord
      L'Estrange, when he deigned to desire it. Without much pretence to that
      personal beauty which strikes at first sight, he still retained all the
      charm of countenance, and all the grace of manner, which had made him in
      boyhood the spoiled darling of society. Madame di Negra had collected but
      a small circle round her; still it was of the elite of the great world,&mdash;not,
      indeed, those more precise and reserved dames de chateau, whom the lighter
      and easier of the fair dispensers of fashion ridicule as prudes; but
      nevertheless, ladies were there, as unblemished in reputation, as high in
      rank, flirts and coquettes, perhaps,&mdash;nothing more; in short,
      "charming women,"&mdash;the gay butterflies that hover over the stiff
      parterre. And there were ambassadors and ministers, and wits and brilliant
      debaters, and first-rate dandies (dandies, when first-rate, are generally
      very agreeable men). Amongst all these various persons, Harley, so long a
      stranger to the London world, seemed to make himself at home with the ease
      of an Alcibiades. Many of the less juvenile ladies remembered him, and
      rushed to claim his acquaintance, with nods and becks, and wreathed
      smiles. He had ready compliment for each. And few indeed were there, men
      or women, for whom Harley L'Estrange had not appropriate attraction.
      Distinguished reputation as soldier and scholar for the grave; whim and
      pleasantry for the gay; novelty for the sated; and for the more vulgar
      natures was he not Lord L'Estrange, unmarried, possessed already of a
      large independence, and heir to an ancient earldom, and some fifty
      thousands a year?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till he had succeeded in the general effect&mdash;which, it must be
      owned, he did his best to create&mdash;did Harley seriously and especially
      devote himself to his hostess. And then he seated himself by her side;
      and, as if in compliment to both, less pressing admirers insensibly
      slipped away and edged off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank Hazeldean was the last to quit his ground behind Madame di Negra's
      chair; but when he found that the two began to talk in Italian, and he
      could not understand a word they said, he too&mdash;fancying, poor fellow,
      that he looked foolish, and cursing his Eton education that had neglected,
      for languages spoken by the dead, of which he had learned little, those
      still in use among the living, of which he had learned nought&mdash;retreated
      towards Randal, and asked wistfully, "Pray, what age should you say
      L'Estrange was? He must be devilish old, in spite of his looks. Why, he
      was at Waterloo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is young enough to be a terrible rival," answered Randal, with artful
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank turned pale, and began to meditate dreadful bloodthirsty thoughts,
      of which hair-triggers and Lord's Cricket-ground formed the staple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly there was apparent ground for a lover's jealousy; for Harley and
      Beatrice now conversed in a low tone, and Beatrice seemed agitated, and
      Harley earnest. Randal himself grew more and more perplexed. Was Lord
      L'Estrange really enamoured of the marchesa? If so, farewell to all hopes
      of Frank's marriage with her! Or was he merely playing a part in
      Riccabocca's interest; pretending to be the lover, in order to obtain an
      influence over her mind, rule her through her ambition, and secure an ally
      against her brother? Was this finesse compatible with Randal's notions of
      Harley's character? Was it consistent with that chivalric and soldierly
      spirit of honour which the frank nobleman affected, to make love to a
      woman in mere ruse de guerre? Could mere friendship for Riccabocca be a
      sufficient inducement to a man, who, whatever his weaknesses or his
      errors, seemed to wear on his very forehead a soul above deceit, to stoop
      to paltry means, even for a worthy end? At this question, a new thought
      flashed upon Randal,&mdash;might not Lord L'Estrange have speculated
      himself upon winning Violante; would not that account for all the
      exertions he had made on behalf of her inheritance at the court of Vienna,&mdash;exertions
      of which Peschiera and Beatrice had both complained? Those objections
      which the Austrian government might take to Violante's marriage with some
      obscure Englishman would probably not exist against a man like Harley
      L'Estrange, whose family not only belonged to the highest aristocracy of
      England, but had always supported opinions in vogue amongst the leading
      governments of Europe. Harley himself, it is true, had never taken part in
      politics, but his notions were, no doubt, those of a high-born soldier,
      who had fought, in alliance with Austria, for the restoration of the
      Bourbons. And this immense wealth&mdash;which Violante might lose, if she
      married one like Randal himself&mdash;her marriage with the heir of the
      Lansmeres might actually tend only to secure. Could Harley, with all his
      own expectations, be indifferent to such a prize?&mdash;and no doubt he
      had learned Violante's rare beauty in his correspondence with Riccabocca.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus considered, it seemed natural to Randal's estimate of human nature
      that Harley's more prudish scruples of honour, as regards what is due to
      women, could not resist a temptation so strong. Mere friendship was not a
      motive powerful enough to shake them, but ambition was.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Randal was thus cogitating, Frank thus suffering, and many a
      whisper, in comment on the evident flirtation between the beautiful
      hostess and the accomplished guest, reached the ears both of the brooding
      schemer and the jealous lover, the conversation between the two objects of
      remark and gossip had taken a new turn. Indeed, Beatrice had made an
      effort to change it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is long, my Lord," said she, still speaking Italian, "since I have
      heard sentiments like those you address to me; and if I do not feel myself
      wholly unworthy of them, it is from the pleasure I have felt in reading
      sentiments equally foreign to the language of the world in which I live."
      She took a book from the table as she spoke: "Have you seen this work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley glanced at the title-page. "To be sure I have, and I know the
      author."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I envy you that honour. I should so like also to know one who has
      discovered to me deeps in my own heart which I had never explored."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charming marchesa, if the book has done this, believe me that I have paid
      you no false compliment,&mdash;formed no overflattering estimate of your
      nature; for the charm of the work is but in its simple appeal to good and
      generous emotions, and it can charm none in whom those emotions exist
      not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, that cannot be true, or why is it so popular?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because good and generous emotions are more common to the human heart
      than we are aware of till the appeal comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ask me to think that! I have found the world so base."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me a rude question; but what do you know of the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice looked first in surprise at Harley, then glanced round the room
      with significant irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I thought; you call this little room 'the world.' Be it so. I will
      venture to say, that if the people in this room were suddenly converted
      into an audience before a stage, and you were as consummate in the actor's
      art as you are in all others that please and command&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And were to deliver a speech full of sordid and base sentiments, you
      would be hissed. But let any other woman, with half your powers, arise and
      utter sentiments sweet and womanly, or honest and lofty, and applause
      would flow from every lip, and tears rush to many a worldly eye. The true
      proof of the inherent nobleness of our common nature is in the sympathy it
      betrays with what is noble wherever crowds are collected. Never believe
      the world is base; if it were so, no society could hold together for a
      day. But you would know the author of this book? I will bring him to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," said Harley, rising, and with his candid, winning smile, "do
      you think we shall ever be friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have startled me so that I can scarcely answer. But why would you be
      friends with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you need a friend. You have none?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange flatterer!" said Beatrice, smiling, though very sadly; and
      looking up, her eye caught Randal's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" said Harley, "you are too penetrating to believe that you inspire
      friendship there. Ah, do you suppose that; all the while I have been
      conversing with you, I have not noticed the watchful gaze of Mr. Randal
      Leslie? What tie can possibly connect you together I know not yet; but I
      soon shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! you talk like one of the old Council of Venice. You try hard to
      make me fear you," said Beatrice, seeking to escape from the graver kind
      of impression Harley had made on her, by the affectation partly of
      coquetry, partly of levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I," said L'Estrange, calmly, "tell you already that I fear you no
      more." He bowed, and passed through the crowd to rejoin Audley, who was
      seated in a corner whispering with some of his political colleagues.
      Before Harley reached the minister, he found himself close to Randal and
      young Hazeldean.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to the first, and extended his hand to the last. Randal felt the
      distinction, and his sullen, bitter pride was deeply galled,&mdash;a
      feeling of hate towards Harley passed into his mind. He was pleased to see
      the cold hesitation with which Frank just touched the hand offered to him.
      But Randal had not been the only person whose watch upon Beatrice the
      keen-eyed Harley had noticed. Harley had seen the angry looks of Frank
      Hazeldean, and divined the cause. So he smiled forgivingly at the slight
      he had received. "You are like me, Mr. Hazeldean," said he. "You think
      something of the heart should go with all courtesy that bespeaks
      friendship&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "'The hand of Douglas is his own.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Here Harley drew aside Randal. "Mr. Leslie, a word with you. If I wished
      to know the retreat of Dr. Riccabocca, in order to render him a great
      service, would you confide to me that secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That woman has let out her suspicions that I know the exile's retreat,"
      thought Randal; and with quick presence of mind, he replied at once,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, yonder stands a connection of Dr. Riccabocca's. Mr. Hazeldean is
      surely the person to whom you should address this inquiry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, Mr. Leslie; for I suspect that he cannot answer it, and that you
      can. Well, I will ask something that it seems to me you may grant without
      hesitation. Should you see Dr. Riccabocca, tell him that I am in England,
      and so leave it to him to communicate with me or not; but perhaps you have
      already done so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange," said Randal, bowing low, with pointed formality,
      "excuse me if I decline either to disclaim or acquiesce in the knowledge
      you impute to me. If I am acquainted with any secret intrusted to me by
      Dr. Riccabocca, it is for me to use my own discretion how best to guard
      it. And for the rest, after the Scotch earl, whose words your Lordship has
      quoted, refused to touch the hand of Marmion, Douglas could scarcely have
      called Marmion back in order to give him&mdash;a message!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was not prepared for this tone in Mr. Egerton's protege, and his
      own gallant nature was rather pleased than irritated by a haughtiness that
      at least seemed to bespeak independence of spirit. Nevertheless,
      L'Estrange's suspicions of Randal were too strong to be easily set aside,
      and therefore he replied, civilly, but with covert taunt,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I submit to your rebuke, Mr. Leslie, though I meant not the offence you
      would ascribe to me. I regret my unlucky quotation yet the more, since the
      wit of your retort has obliged you to identify yourself with Marmion, who,
      though a clever and brave fellow, was an uncommonly&mdash;tricky one." And
      so Harley, certainly having the best of it, moved on, and joined Egerton,
      and in a few minutes more both left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was L'Estrange saying to you?" asked Frank. "Something about
      Beatrice, I am sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; only quoting poetry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what made you look so angry, my dear fellow? I know it was your kind
      feeling for me. As you say, he is a formidable rival. But that can't be
      his own hair. Do you think he wears a toupet? I am sure he was praising
      Beatrice. He is evidently very much smitten with her. But I don't think
      she is a woman to be caught by mere rank and fortune! Do you? Why can't
      you speak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do not get her consent soon, I think she is lost to you," said
      Randal, slowly; and before Frank could recover his dismay, glided from the
      house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Violante's first evening at the Lansmeres had passed more happily to her
      than the first evening under the same roof had done to Helen. True that
      she missed her father much, Jemima somewhat; but she so identified her
      father's cause with Harley that she had a sort of vague feeling that it
      was to promote that cause that she was on this visit to Harley's parents.
      And the countess, it must be owned, was more emphatically cordial to her
      than she had ever yet been to Captain Digby's orphan. But perhaps the real
      difference in the heart of either girl was this, that Helen felt awe of
      Lady Lansmere, and Violante felt only love for Lord L'Estrange's mother.
      Violante, too, was one of those persons whom a reserved and formal person,
      like the countess, "can get on with," as the phrase goes. Not so poor
      little Helen,&mdash;so shy herself, and so hard to coax into more than
      gentle monosyllables. And Lady Lansmere's favourite talk was always of
      Harley. Helen had listened to such talk with respect and interest.
      Violante listened to it with inquisitive eagerness, with blushing delight.
      The mother's heart noticed the distinction between the two, and no wonder
      that that heart moved more to Violante than to Helen. Lord Lansmere, too,
      like most gentlemen of his age, clumped all young ladies together as a
      harmless, amiable, but singularly stupid class of the genus-Petticoat,
      meant to look pretty, play the piano, and talk to each other about frocks
      and sweethearts. Therefore this animated, dazzling creature, with her
      infinite variety of look and play of mind, took him by surprise, charmed
      him into attention, and warmed him into gallantry. Helen sat in her quiet
      corner, at her work, sometimes listening with almost mournful, though
      certainly unenvious, admiration at Violante's vivid, yet ever unconscious,
      eloquence of word and thought, sometimes plunged deep into her own secret
      meditations. And all the while the work went on the same, under the small,
      noiseless fingers. This was one of Helen's habits that irritated the
      nerves of Lady Lansmere. She despised young ladies who were fond of work.
      She did not comprehend how often it is the resource of the sweet womanly
      mind, not from want of thought, but from the silence and the depth of it.
      Violante was surprised, and perhaps disappointed, that Harley had left the
      house before dinner, and did not return all the evening. But Lady
      Lansmere, in making excuse for his absence, on the plea of engagements,
      found so good an opportunity to talk of his ways in general,&mdash;of his
      rare promise in boyhood, of her regret at the inaction of his maturity, of
      her hope to see him yet do justice to his natural powers,&mdash;that
      Violante almost ceased to miss him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Lady Lansmere conducted her to her room, and, kissing her cheek
      tenderly, said, "But you are just the person Harley admires,&mdash;just
      the person to rouse him from melancholy dreams, of which his wild humours
      are now but the vain disguise"&mdash;Violante crossed her arms on her
      bosom, and her bright eyes, deepened into tenderness, seemed to ask, "He
      melancholy&mdash;and why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving Violante's room, Lady Lansmere paused before the door of
      Helen's; and, after musing a little while, entered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had dismissed her maid; and, at the moment Lady Lansmere entered,
      she was kneeling at the foot of the bed, her hands clasped before her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her form, thus seen, looked so youthful and child-like, the attitude
      itself was so holy and so touching, that the proud and cold expression on
      Lady Lansmere's face changed. She shaded the light involuntarily, and
      seated herself in silence that she might not disturb the act of prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Helen rose, she was startled to see the countess seated by the fire,
      and hastily drew her hand across her eyes. She had been weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lansmere did not, however, turn to observe those traces of tears,
      which Helen feared were too visible. The countess was too absorbed in her
      own thoughts; and as Helen timidly approached, she said&mdash;still with
      her eyes on the clear low fire&mdash;"I beg your pardon, Miss Digby, for
      my intrusion; but my son has left it to me to prepare Lord Lansmere to
      learn the offer you have done Harley the honour to accept. I have not yet
      spoken to my Lord; it may be days before I find a fitting occasion to do
      so; meanwhile I feel assured that your sense of propriety will make you
      agree, with me that it is due to Lord L'Estrange's father, that strangers
      should not learn arrangements of such moment in his family before his own
      consent be obtained."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the countess came to a full pause; and poor Helen, finding herself
      called upon for some reply to this chilling speech, stammered out, scarce
      audibly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, madam, I never dreamed of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is right, my dear," interrupted Lady Lansmere, rising suddenly, and
      as if greatly relieved. "I could not doubt your superiority to ordinary
      girls of your age, with whom these matters are never secret for a moment.
      Therefore, of course, you will not mention, at present, what has passed
      between you and Harley, to any of the friends with whom you may
      correspond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no correspondents, no friends, Lady Lansmere," said Helen,
      deprecatingly, and trying hard not to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad to hear it, my dear; young ladies never should have.
      Friends, especially friends who correspond, are the worst enemies they can
      have. Good-night, Miss Digby. I need not add, by the way, that though we
      are bound to show all kindness to this young Italian lady, still she is
      wholly unconnected with our family; and you will be as prudent with her as
      you would have been with your correspondents, had you had the misfortune
      to have any."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lansmere said the last words with a smile, and left an ungenial kiss
      (the stepmother's kiss) on Helen's bended brow. She then left the room,
      and Helen sat on the seat vacated by the stately, unloving form, and again
      covered her face with her hands, and again wept. But when she rose at
      last, and the light fell upon her face, that soft face was sad indeed, but
      serene,&mdash;serene, as with some inward sense of duty, sad, as with the
      resignation which accepts patience instead of hope.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Harley appeared at breakfast. He was in gay spirits, and
      conversed more freely with Violante than he had yet done. He seemed to
      amuse himself by attacking all she said, and provoking her to argument.
      Violante was naturally a very earnest person; whether grave or gay, she
      spoke with her heart on her lips, and her soul in her eyes. She did not
      yet comprehend the light vein of Harley's irony, so she grew piqued and
      chafed; and she was so lovely in anger; it so brightened the beauty and
      animated her words, that no wonder Harley thus maliciously teased her. But
      what, perhaps, she liked still less than the teasing&mdash;though she
      could not tell why&mdash;was the kind of familiarity that Harley assumed
      with her,&mdash;a familiarity as if he had known her all her life,&mdash;that
      of a good-humoured elder brother, or a bachelor uncle. To Helen, on the
      contrary, when he did not address her apart, his manner was more
      respectful. He did not call her by her Christian name, as he did Violante,
      but "Miss Digby," and softened his tone and inclined his head when he
      spoke to her. Nor did he presume to jest at the very few and brief
      sentences he drew from Helen, but rather listened to them with deference,
      and invariably honoured them with approval. After breakfast he asked
      Violante to play or sing; and when she frankly owned how little she had
      cultivated those accomplishments, he persuaded Helen to sit down to the
      piano, and stood by her side while she did so, turning over the leaves of
      her music-book with the ready devotion of an admiring amateur. Helen
      always played well, but less well than usual that day, for her generous
      nature felt abashed. It was as if she were showing off to mortify
      Violante. But Violante, on the other hand, was so passionately fond of
      music that she had no feeling left for the sense of her own inferiority.
      Yet she sighed when Helen rose, and Harley thanked Miss Digby for the
      delight she had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was fine. Lady Lansmere proposed to walk in the garden. While the
      ladies went up-stairs for their shawls and bonnets, Harley lighted his
      cigar, and stepped from the window upon the lawn. Lady Lansmere joined him
      before the girls came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley," said she, taking his arm, "what a charming companion you have
      introduced to us! I never met with any that both pleased and delighted me
      like this dear Violante. Most girls who possess some power of
      conversation, and who have dared to think for themselves, are so pedantic,
      or so masculine; but she is always so simple, and always still the girl.
      Ah, Harley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why that sigh, my dear mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking how exactly she would have suited you,&mdash;how proud I
      should have been of such a daughter-in-law, and how happy you would have
      been with such a wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley started. "Tut," said he, peevishly, "she is a mere child; you
      forget my years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Lady Lansmere, surprised, "Helen is quite as young as
      Violante."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In dates-yes. But Helen's character is so staid; what it is now it will
      be ever; and Helen, from gratitude, respect, or pity, condescends to
      accept the ruins of my heart, while this bright Italian has the soul of a
      Juliet, and would expect in a husband all the passion of a Romeo. Nay,
      Mother, hush. Do you forget that I am engaged,&mdash;and of my own free
      will and choice? Poor dear Helen! A propos, have you spoken to my father,
      as you undertook to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet. I must seize the right moment. You know that my Lord requires
      management."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear mother, that female notion of managing us men costs you ladies a
      great waste of time, and occasions us a great deal of sorrow. Men are
      easily managed by plain truth. We are brought up to respect it, strange as
      it may seem to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lansmere smiled with the air of superior wisdom, and the experience
      of an accomplished wife. "Leave it to me, Harley, and rely on my Lord's
      consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley knew that Lady Lansmere always succeeded in obtaining her way with
      his father; and he felt that the earl might naturally be disappointed in
      such an alliance, and, without due propitiation, evince that
      disappointment in his manner to Helen. Harley was bound to save her from
      all chance of such humiliation. He did not wish her to think that she was
      not welcomed into his family; therefore he said, "I resign myself to your
      promise and your diplomacy. Meanwhile, as you love me, be kind to my
      betrothed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I not so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hem. Are you as kind as if she were the great heiress you believe
      Violante to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it," answered Lady Lansmere, evading the question&mdash;"is it because
      one is an heiress and the other is not that you make so marked a
      difference in your own manner to the two; treating Violante as a spoilt
      child, and Miss Digby as&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The destined wife of Lord L'Estrange, and the daughter-in-law of Lady
      Lansmere,&mdash;yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess suppressed an impatient exclamation that rose to her lips,
      for Harley's brow wore that serious aspect which it rarely assumed save
      when he was in those moods in which men must be soothed, not resisted. And
      after a pause he went on, "I am going to leave you to-day. I have engaged
      apartments at the Clarendon. I intend to gratify your wish, so often
      expressed, that I should enjoy what are called the pleasures of my rank,
      and the privileges of single-blessedness,&mdash;celebrate my adieu to
      celibacy, and blaze once more, with the splendour of a setting sun, upon
      Hyde Park and May Fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a positive enigma. Leave our house, just when you are betrothed
      to its inmate! Is that the natural conduct of a lover?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can your woman eyes be so dull, and your woman heart so obtuse?"
      answered Harley, half laughing, half scolding. "Can you not guess that I
      wish that Helen and myself should both lose the association of mere ward
      and guardian; that the very familiarity of our intercourse under the same
      roof almost forbids us to be lovers; that we lose the joy to meet, and the
      pang to part. Don't you remember the story of the Frenchman, who for
      twenty years loved a lady, and never missed passing his evenings at her
      house. She became a widow. 'I wish you joy,' cried his friend; 'you may
      now marry the woman you have so long adored.' 'Alas!' said the poor
      Frenchman, profoundly dejected; 'and if so, where shall I spend my
      evenings?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Violante and Helen were seen in the garden, walking affectionately
      arm in arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't perceive the point of your witty, heartless anecdote," said Lady
      Lansmere, obstinately. "Settle that, however, with Miss Digby. But to
      leave the very day after your friend's daughter comes as a guest!&mdash;what
      will she think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange looked steadfastly at his mother. "Does it matter much
      what she thinks of me,&mdash;of a man engaged to another; and old enough
      to be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to heaven you would not talk of your age, Harley; it is a
      reflection upon mine; and I never saw you look so well nor so handsome."
      With that she drew him on towards the young ladies; and, taking Helen's
      arm, asked her, aside, "If she knew that Lord L'Estrange had engaged rooms
      at the Clarendon; and if she understood why?" As while she said this she
      moved on, Harley was left by Violante's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be very dull here, I fear, my poor child," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dull! But why will you call me child? Am I so very&mdash;very
      child-like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, you are to me,&mdash;a mere infant. Have I not seen you one;
      have I not held you in my arms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"But that was a long time ago!"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"True. But if years have not stood still for you, they have
      not been stationary for me. There is the same difference between us now
      that there was then. And, therefore, permit me still to call you child,
      and as child to treat you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"I will do no such thing. Do you know that I always
      thought I was good-tempered till this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"And what undeceived you? Did you break your doll?"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE (with an indignant flash from her dark eyes).&mdash;"There!&mdash;again!&mdash;you
      delight in provoking me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"It was the doll, then. Don't cry; I will get you another."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante plucked her arm from him, and walked away towards the countess in
      speechless scorn. Harley's brow contracted, in thought and in gloom. He
      stood still for a moment or so, and then joined the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am trespassing sadly on your morning; but I wait for a visitor whom I
      sent to before you were up. He is to be here at twelve. With your
      permission, I will dine with you tomorrow, and you will invite him to meet
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. And who is your friend? I guess&mdash;the young author?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leonard Fairfield," cried Violante, who had conquered, or felt ashamed,
      of her short-lived anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fairfield!" repeated Lady Lansmere. "I thought, Harley, you said the name
      was Oran."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has assumed the latter name. He is the son of Mark Fairfield, who
      married an Avenel. Did you recognize no family likeness?&mdash;none in
      those eyes, Mother?" said Harley, sinking his voice into a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No;" answered the countess, falteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley, observing that Violante was now speaking to Helen about Leonard,
      and that neither was listening to him, resumed in the same low tone, "And
      his mother&mdash;Nora's sister&mdash;shrank from seeing me! That is the
      reason why I wished you not to call. She has not told the young man why
      she shrank from seeing me; nor have I explained it to him as yet. Perhaps
      I never shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, dearest Harley," said the countess, with great gentleness, "I
      wish you too much to forget the folly&mdash;well, I will not say that word&mdash;the
      sorrows of your boyhood, not to hope that you will rather strive against
      such painful memories than renew them by unnecessary confidence to any
      one; least of all to the relation of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough! don't name her; the very name pains me. And as to confidence,
      there are but two persons in the world to whom I ever bare the old wounds,&mdash;yourself
      and Egerton. Let this pass. Ha!&mdash;a ring at the bell&mdash;that is
      he!"

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard entered on the scene, and joined the party in the garden. The
      countess, perhaps to please her son, was more than civil,&mdash;she was
      markedly kind to him. She noticed him more attentively than she had
      hitherto done; and, with all her prejudices of birth, was struck to find
      the son of Mark Fairfield the carpenter so thoroughly the gentleman. He
      might not have the exact tone and phrase by which Convention stereotypes
      those born and schooled in a certain world; but the aristocrats of Nature
      can dispense with such trite minutia? And Leonard had lived, of late at
      least, in the best society that exists for the polish of language and the
      refinement of manners,&mdash;the society in which the most graceful ideas
      are clothed in the most graceful forms; the society which really, though
      indirectly, gives the law to courts; the society of the most classic
      authors, in the various ages in which literature has flowered forth from
      civilization. And if there was something in the exquisite sweetness of
      Leonard's voice, look, and manner, which the countess acknowledged to
      attain that perfection in high breeding, which, under the name of
      "suavity," steals its way into the heart, so her interest in him was
      aroused by a certain subdued melancholy which is rarely without
      distinction, and never without charm. He and Helen exchanged but few
      words. There was but one occasion in which they could have spoken apart,
      and Helen herself contrived to elude it. His face brightened at Lady
      Lansmere's cordial invitation, and he glanced at Helen as he accepted it;
      but her eye did not meet his own.

      "And now," said Harley, whistling to Nero, whom his ward was silently
      caressing, "I must take Leonard away. Adieu! all of you, till to-morrow at
      dinner. Miss Violante, is the doll to have blue eyes or black?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante turned her own black eyes in mute appeal to Lady Lansmere, and
      nestled to that lady's side as if in refuge from unworthy insult.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Let the carriage go to the Clarendon," said Harley to his servant; "I and
      Mr. Oran will walk to town. Leonard, I think you would rejoice at an
      occasion to serve your old friends, Dr. Riccabocca and his daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serve them! Oh, yes." And there instantly returned to Leonard the
      recollection of Violante's words when, on leaving his quiet village, he
      had sighed to part from all those he loved; and the little dark-eyed girl
      had said, proudly, yet consolingly, "But to SERVE those you love!" He
      turned to L'Estrange, with beaming, inquisitive eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said to our friend," resumed Harley, "that I would vouch for your
      honour as my own. I am about to prove my words, and to confide the secrets
      which your penetration has indeed divined,&mdash;our friend is not what he
      seems." Harley then briefly related to Leonard the particulars of the
      exile's history, the rank he had held in his native land, the manner in
      which, partly through the misrepresentations of a kinsman he had trusted,
      partly through the influence of a wife he had loved, he had been drawn
      into schemes which he believed bounded to the emancipation of Italy from a
      foreign yoke by the united exertions of her best and bravest sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A noble ambition!" interrupted Leonard, manfully. "And pardon me, my
      Lord, I should not have thought that you would speak of it in a tone that
      implies blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ambition in itself was noble," answered Harley; "but the cause to
      which it was devoted became defiled in its dark channel through Secret
      Societies. It is the misfortune of all miscellaneous political
      combinations, that with the purest motives of their more generous members
      are ever mixed the most sordid interests, and the fiercest passions of
      mean confederates. When those combinations act openly, and in daylight,
      under the eye of Public Opinion, the healthier elements usually prevail;
      where they are shrouded in mystery, where they are subjected to no censor
      in the discussion of the impartial and dispassionate, where chiefs working
      in the dark exact blind obedience, and every man who is at war with law is
      at once admitted as a friend of freedom, the history of the world tells us
      that patriotism soon passes away. Where all is in public, public virtue,
      by the natural sympathies of the common mind, and by the wholesome control
      of shame, is likely to obtain ascendancy; where all is in private, and
      shame is but for him who refuses the abnegation of his conscience, each
      man seeks the indulgence of his private vice. And hence in Secret
      Societies (from which may yet proceed great danger to all Europe) we find
      but foul and hateful Eleusinia, affording pretexts to the ambition of the
      great, to the license of the penniless, to the passions of the revengeful,
      to the anarchy of the ignorant. In a word, the societies of these Italian
      Carbonari did but engender schemes in which the abler chiefs disguised new
      forms of despotism, and in which the revolutionary many looked forward to
      the overthrow of all the institutions that stand between Law and Chaos.
      Naturally, therefore," added L'Estrange, dryly, "when their schemes were
      detected, and the conspiracy foiled, it was for the silly, honest men
      entrapped into the league to suffer, the leaders turned king's evidence,
      and the common mercenaries became&mdash;banditti." Harley then proceeded
      to state that it was just when the soi-disant Riccabocca had discovered
      the true nature and ulterior views of the conspirators he had joined, and
      actually withdrawn from their councils, that he was denounced by the
      kinsman who had duped him into the enterprise, and who now profited by his
      treason. Harley next spoke of the packet despatched by Riccabocca's dying
      wife, as it was supposed, to Mrs. Bertram; and of the hopes he founded on
      the contents of that packet, if discovered. He then referred to the design
      which had brought Peschiera to England,&mdash;a design which that
      personage had avowed with such effrontery to his companions at Vienna,
      that he had publicly laid wagers on his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But these men can know nothing of England, of the safety of English
      laws," said Leonard, naturally. "We take it for granted that Riccabocca,
      if I am still so to call him, refuses his consent to the marriage between
      his daughter and his foe. Where, then, the danger? This count, even if
      Violante were not under your mother's roof, could not get an opportunity
      to see her. He could not attack the house and carry her off like a feudal
      baron in the middle ages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this is very true," answered Harley. "Yet I have found through life
      that we cannot estimate danger by external circumstances, but by the
      character of those from whom it is threatened. This count is a man of
      singular audacity, of no mean natural talents,&mdash;talents practised in
      every art of duplicity and intrigue; one of those men whose boast it is
      that they succeed in whatever they undertake; and he is, here, urged on
      the one hand by all that can whet the avarice, and on the other, by all
      that can give invention to despair. Therefore, though I cannot guess what
      plan he may possibly adopt, I never doubt that some plan, formed with
      cunning and pursued with daring, will be embraced the moment he discovers
      Violante's retreat,&mdash;unless, indeed, we can forestall all peril by
      the restoration of her father, and the detection of the fraud and
      falsehood to which Peschiera owes the fortune he appropriates. Thus, while
      we must prosecute to the utmost our inquiries for the missing documents,
      so it should be our care to possess ourselves, if possible, of such
      knowledge of the count's machinations as may enable us to defeat them.
      Now, it was with satisfaction that I learned in Germany that Peschiera's
      sister was in London. I knew enough both of his disposition and of the
      intimacy between himself and this lady, to make me think it probable he
      will seek to make her his instrument and accomplice, should he require
      one. Peschiera (as you may suppose by his audacious wager) is not one of
      those secret villains who would cut off their right hand if it could
      betray the knowledge of what was done by the left,&mdash;rather one of
      those self-confident vaunting knaves of high animal spirits, and
      conscience so obtuse that it clouds their intellect, who must have some
      one to whom they can boast of their abilities and confide their projects.
      And Peschiera has done all he can to render this poor woman so wholly
      dependent on him as to be his slave and his tool. But I have learned
      certain traits in her character that show it to be impressionable to good,
      and with tendencies to honour. Peschiera had taken advantage of the
      admiration she excited, some years ago, in a rich young Englishman, to
      entice this admirer into gambling, and sought to make his sister both a
      decoy and an instrument in his designs of plunder. She did not encourage
      the addresses of our countryman, but she warned him of the snare laid for
      him, and entreated him to leave the place lest her brother should discover
      and punish her honesty. The Englishman told me this himself. In fine, my
      hope of detaching this lady from Peschiera's interests, and inducing her
      to forewarn us of his purpose, consists but in the innocent, and, I hope,
      laudable artifice, of redeeming herself,&mdash;of appealing to, and
      calling into disused exercise, the better springs of her nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard listened with admiration and some surprise to the singularly
      subtle and sagacious insight into character which Harley evinced in the
      brief clear strokes by which he had thus depicted Peschiera and Beatrice,
      and was struck by the boldness with which Harley rested a whole system of
      action upon a few deductions drawn from his reasonings on human motive and
      characteristic bias. Leonard had not expected to find so much practical
      acuteness in a man who, however accomplished, usually seemed indifferent,
      dreamy, and abstracted to the ordinary things of life. But Harley
      L'Estrange was one of those whose powers lie dormant till circumstance
      applies to them all they need for activity,&mdash;the stimulant of a
      motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley resumed: "After a conversation I had with the lady last night, it
      occurred to me that in this part of our diplomacy you could render us
      essential service. Madame di Negra&mdash;such is the sister's name&mdash;has
      conceived an admiration for your genius, and a strong desire to know you
      personally. I have promised to present you to her; and I shall do so after
      a preliminary caution. The lady is very handsome, and very fascinating. It
      is possible that your heart and your senses may not be proof against her
      attractions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do not fear that!" exclaimed Leonard, with a tone of conviction so
      earnest that Harley smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forewarned is not always forearmed against the might of beauty, my dear
      Leonard; so I cannot at once accept your assurance. But listen to me!
      Watch yourself narrowly, and if you find that you are likely to be
      captivated, promise, on your honour, to retreat at once from the field. I
      have no right, for the sake of another, to expose you to danger; and
      Madame di Negra, whatever may be her good qualities, is the last person I
      should wish to see you in love with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In love with her! Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible is a strong word," returned Harley; "still I own fairly (and
      this belief alone warrants me in trusting you to her fascinations), that I
      do think, as far as one man can judge of another, that she is not the
      woman to attract you; and if filled by one pure and generous object in
      your intercourse with her, you will see her with purged eyes. Still I
      claim your promise as one of honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give it," said Leonard, positively. "But how can I serve Riccabocca?
      How aid in&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus," interrupted Harley: "the spell of your writings is, that,
      unconsciously to ourselves, they make us better and nobler. And your
      writings are but the impressions struck off from your mind. Your
      conversation, when you are roused, has the same effect. And as you grow
      more familiar with Madame di Negra, I wish you to speak of your boyhood,
      your youth. Describe the exile as you have seen him,&mdash;so touching
      amidst his foibles, so grand amidst the petty privations of his fallen
      fortunes, so benevolent while poring over his hateful Machiavelli, so
      stingless in his wisdom of the serpent, so playfully astute in his
      innocence of the dove&mdash;I leave the picture to your knowledge of
      humour and pathos. Describe Violante brooding over her Italian Poets, and
      filled with dreams of her fatherland; describe her with all the flashes of
      her princely nature, shining forth through humble circumstance and obscure
      position; waken in your listener compassion, respect, admiration for her
      kindred exiles,&mdash;and I think our work is done. She will recognize
      evidently those whom her brother seeks. She will question you closely
      where you met with them, where they now are. Protect that secret; say at
      once that it is not your own. Against your descriptions and the feelings
      they excite, she will not be guarded as against mine. And there are other
      reasons why your influence over this woman of mixed nature may be more
      direct and effectual than my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I cannot conceive that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe it, without asking me to explain," answered Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he did not judge it necessary to say to Leonard: "I am high-born and
      wealthy, you a peasant's son, and living by your exertions. This woman is
      ambitious and distressed. She might have projects on me that would
      counteract mine on her. You she would but listen to, and receive, through
      the sentiments of good or of poetical that are in her; you she would have
      no interest to subjugate, no motive to ensnare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," said Harley, turning the subject, "I have another object in
      view. This foolish sage friend of ours, in his bewilderment and fears, has
      sought to save Violante from one rogue by promising her hand to a man who,
      unless my instincts deceive me, I suspect much disposed to be another.
      Sacrifice such exuberance of life and spirit to that bloodless heart, to
      that cold and earthward intellect! By Heaven, it shall not be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But whom can the exile possibly have seen of birth and fortunes to render
      him a fitting spouse for his daughter? Whom, my Lord, except yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me!" exclaimed Harley, angrily, and changing colour. "I worthy of such a
      creature?&mdash;I, with my habits! I, silken egotist that I am! And you, a
      poet, to form such an estimate of one who might be the queen of a poet's
      dream!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, when we sat the other night round Riccabocca's hearth, when I
      heard her speak, and observed you listen, I said to myself, from such
      knowledge of human nature as comes, we know not how, to us poets,&mdash;I
      said, 'Harley L'Estrange has looked long and wistfully on the heavens, and
      he now hears the murmur of the wings that can waft him towards them.' And
      then I sighed, for I thought how the world rules us all in spite of
      ourselves, and I said, 'What pity for both, that the exile's daughter is
      not the worldly equal of the peer's son!' And you too sighed, as I thus
      thought; and I fancied that, while you listened to the music of the wing,
      you felt the iron of the chain. But the exile's daughter is your equal in
      birth, and you are her equal in heart and in soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor Leonard, you rave," answered Harley, calmly. "And if Violante is
      not to be some young prince's bride, she should be some young poet's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poet's! Oh, no!" said Leonard, with a gentle laugh. "Poets need repose
      where they love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was struck by the answer, and mused over it in silence. "I
      comprehend," thought he; "it is a new light that dawns on me. What is
      needed by the man whose whole life is one strain after glory&mdash;whose
      soul sinks, in fatigue, to the companionship of earth&mdash;is not the
      love of a nature like his own. He is right,&mdash;it is repose! While I!&mdash;it
      is true; boy that he is, his intuitions are wiser than all my experience!
      It is excitement, energy, elevation, that Love should bestow on me. But I
      have chosen; and, at least, with Helen my life will be calm, and my hearth
      sacred. Let the rest sleep in the same grave as my youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Leonard, wishing kindly to arouse his noble friend from a
      revery which he felt was mournful, though he did not divine its true
      cause,&mdash;"but you have not yet told me the name of the signorina's
      suitor. May I know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably one you never heard of. Randal Leslie,&mdash;a placeman. You
      refused a place; you were right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Randal Leslie? Heaven forbid!" cried Leonard, revealing his surprise at
      the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen! But what do you know of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leonard related the story of Burley's pamphlet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley seemed delighted to hear his suspicions of Randal confirmed. "The
      paltry pretender;&mdash;and yet I fancied that he might be formidable!
      However, we must dismiss him for the present,&mdash;we are approaching
      Madame di Negra's house. Prepare yourself, and remember your promise."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some days have passed by. Leonard and Beatrice di Negra have already made
      friends. Harley is satisfied with his young friend's report. He himself
      has been actively occupied. He has sought, but hitherto in vain, all trace
      of Mrs. Bertram; he has put that investigation into the hands of his
      lawyer, and his lawyer has not been more fortunate than himself. Moreover,
      Harley has blazed forth again in the London world, and promises again de
      faire fureur; but he has always found time to spend some hours in the
      twenty-four at his father's house. He has continued much the same tone
      with Violante, and she begins to accustom herself to it, and reply
      saucily. His calm courtship to Helen flows on in silence. Leonard, too,
      has been a frequent guest at the Lansmeres: all welcome and like him
      there. Peschiera has not evinced any sign of the deadly machinations
      ascribed to him. He goes less into the drawing-room world; for in that
      world he meets Lord L'Estrange; and brilliant and handsome though
      Peschiera be, Lord L'Estrange, like Rob Roy Macgregor, is "on his native
      heath," and has the decided advantage over the foreigner. Peschiera,
      however, shines in the clubs, and plays high. Still, scarcely an evening
      passes in which he and Baron Levy do not meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley Egerton has been intensely occupied with affairs, only seen once by
      Harley. Harley then was about to deliver himself of his sentiments
      respecting Randal Leslie, and to communicate the story of Burley and the
      pamphlet. Egerton stopped him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Harley, don't try to set me against this young man. I wish to
      hear nothing in his disfavour. In the first place, it would not alter the
      line of conduct I mean to adopt with regard to him. He is my wife's
      kinsman; I charged myself with his career, as a wish of hers, and
      therefore as a duty to myself. In attaching him so young to my own fate, I
      drew him necessarily away from the professions in which his industry and
      talents (for he has both in no common degree) would have secured his
      fortunes; therefore, be he bad, be he good, I shall try to provide for him
      as I best can; and, moreover, cold as I am to him, and worldly though
      perhaps he be, I have somehow or other conceived an interest in him, a
      liking to him. He has been under my roof, he is dependent on me; he has
      been docile and prudent, and I am a lone childless man; therefore, spare
      him, since in so doing you spare me; and ah, Harley, I have so many cares
      on me now that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, say no more, my dear, dear Audley," cried the generous friend; "how
      little people know you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley's hand trembled. Certainly his nerves began to show wear and tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the object of this dialogue&mdash;the type of perverted
      intellect, of mind without heart, of knowledge which had no aim but power&mdash;was
      in a state of anxious, perturbed gloom. He did not know whether wholly to
      believe Levy's assurance of his patron's ruin. He could not believe it
      when he saw that great house in Grosvenor Square, its hall crowded with
      lacqueys, its sideboard blazing with plate; when no dun was ever seen in
      the antechamber; when not a tradesman was ever known to call twice for a
      bill. He hinted to Levy the doubts all these phenomena suggested to him;
      but the baron only smiled ominously, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, the tradesmen are always paid; but the how is the question! Randal,
      mon cher, you are too innocent. I have but two pieces of advice to
      suggest, in the shape of two proverbs,&mdash;'Wise rats run from a falling
      house,' and, 'Make hay while the sun shines.' A propos, Mr. Avenel likes
      you greatly, and has been talking of the borough of Lansmere for you. He
      has contrived to get together a great interest there. Make much of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal had indeed been to Mrs. Avenel's soiree dansante, and called twice
      and found her at home, and been very bland and civil, and admired the
      children. She had two, a boy and a girl, very like their father, with open
      faces as bold as brass. And as all this had won Mrs. Avenel's good graces,
      so it had propitiated her husband's. Avenel was shrewd enough to see how
      clever Randal was. He called him "smart," and said "he would have got on
      in America," which was the highest praise Dick Avenel ever accorded to any
      man. But Dick himself looked a little careworn; and this was the first
      year in which he had murmured at the bills of his wife's dressmaker, and
      said with an oath, that "there was such a thing as going too much ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal had visited Dr. Riccabocca, and found Violante flown. True to his
      promise to Harley, the Italian refused to say where, and suggested, as was
      agreed, that for the present it would be more prudent if Randal suspended
      his visits to himself. Leslie, not liking this proposition, attempted to
      make himself still necessary by working on Riccabocca's fears as to that
      espionage on his retreat, which had been among the reasons that had
      hurried the sage into offering Randal Violante's hand. But Riccabocca had
      already learned that the fancied spy was but his neighbour Leonard; and,
      without so saying, he cleverly contrived to make the supposition of such
      espionage an additional reason for the cessation of Leslie's visits.
      Randal then, in his own artful, quiet, roundabout way, had sought to find
      out if any communication had passed between L'Estrange and Riccabocca.
      Brooding over Harley's words to him, he suspected there had been such
      communication, with his usual penetrating astuteness. Riceabocca, here,
      was less on his guard, and rather parried the sidelong questions than
      denied their inferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal began already to surmise the truth. Where was it likely Violante
      should go but to the Lansmeres? This confirmed his idea of Harley's
      pretensions to her hand. With such a rival what chance had he? Randal
      never doubted for a moment that the pupil of Machiavelli would "throw him
      over," if such an alliance to his daughter really presented itself. The
      schemer at once discarded from his objects all further aim on Violante;
      either she would be poor, and he would not have her; or she would be rich,
      and her father would give her to another. As his heart had never been
      touched by the fair Italian, so the moment her inheritance became more
      doubtful, it gave him no pang to lose her; but he did feel very sore and
      resentful at the thought of being supplanted by Lord L'Estrange,&mdash;the
      man who had insulted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither, as yet, had Randal made any way in his designs on Frank. For
      several days Madame di Negra had not been at home either to himself or
      young Hazeldean; and Frank, though very unhappy, was piqued and angry; and
      Randal suspected, and suspected, and suspected, he knew not exactly what,
      but that the devil was not so kind to him there as that father of lies
      ought to have been to a son so dutiful. Yet, with all these
      discouragements, there was in Randal Leslie so dogged and determined a
      conviction of his own success, there was so great a tenacity of purpose
      under obstacles, and so vigilant an eye upon all chances that could be
      turned to his favour, that he never once abandoned hope, nor did more than
      change the details in his main schemes. Out of calculations apparently the
      most far-fetched and improbable, he had constructed a patient policy, to
      which he obstinately clung. How far his reasonings and patience served to
      his ends remains yet to be seen. But could our contempt for the baseness
      of Randal himself be separated from the faculties which he elaborately
      degraded to the service of that baseness, one might allow that there was
      something one could scarcely despise in this still self-reliance, this
      inflexible resolve. Had such qualities, aided as they were by abilities of
      no ordinary acuteness, been applied to objects commonly honest, one would
      have backed Randal Leslie against any fifty picked prize-men from the
      colleges. But there are judges of weight and metal who do that now,
      especially Baron Levy, who says to himself as he eyes that pale face all
      intellect, and that spare form all nerve, "This is a man who must make way
      in life; he is worth helping."
    </p>
    <p>
      By the words "worth helping" Baron Levy meant "worth getting into my
      power, that he may help me."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But parliament had met. Events that belong to history had contributed yet
      more to weaken the administration. Randal Leslie's interest became
      absorbed in politics, for the stake to him was his whole political career.
      Should Audley lose office, and for good, Audley could aid him no more; but
      to abandon his patron, as Levy recommended, and pin himself, in the hope
      of a seat in parliament, to a stranger,&mdash;an obscure stranger, like
      Dick Avenel,&mdash;that was a policy not to be adopted at a breath.
      Meanwhile, almost every night, when the House met, that pale face and
      spare form, which Levy so identified with shrewdness and energy, might be
      seen amongst the benches appropriated to those more select strangers who
      obtain the Speaker's order of admission. There, Randal heard the great men
      of that day, and with the half-contemptuous surprise at their fame, which
      is common enough amongst clever, well-educated young men, who know not
      what it is to speak in the House of Commons. He heard much slovenly
      English, much trite reasoning, some eloquent thoughts, and close argument,
      often delivered in a jerking tone of voice (popularly called the
      parliamentary twang), and often accompanied by gesticulations that would
      have shocked the manager of a provincial theatre. He thought how much
      better than these great dons (with but one or two exceptions), he himself
      could speak,&mdash;with what more refined logic, with what more polished
      periods, how much more like Cicero and Burke! Very probably he might have
      so spoken, and for that very reason have made that deadest of all dead
      failures,&mdash;a pretentious imitation of Burke and Cicero. One thing,
      however, he was obliged to own,&mdash;namely, that in a popular
      representative assembly, it is not precisely knowledge which is power, or
      if knowledge, it is but the knowledge of that particular assembly, and
      what will best take with it; passion, invective, sarcasm, bold
      declamation, shrewd common-sense, the readiness so rarely found in a very
      profound mind,&mdash;he owned that all these were the qualities that told;
      when a man who exhibited nothing but "knowledge," in the ordinary sense of
      the word, stood an imminent chance of being coughed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There at his left&mdash;last but one in the row of the ministerial chiefs&mdash;Randal
      watched Audley Egerton, his arms folded on his breast, his hat drawn over
      his brows, his eyes fixed with steady courage on whatever speaker in the
      Opposition held possession of the floor. And twice Randal heard Egerton
      speak, and marvelled much at the effect that minister produced. For of
      those qualities enumerated above, and which Randal had observed to be most
      sure of success, Audley Egerton only exhibited to a marked degree the
      common-sense and the readiness. And yet, though but little applauded by
      noisy cheers, no speaker seemed more to satisfy friends, and command
      respect from foes. The true secret was this, which Randal might well not
      divine, since that young person, despite his ancient birth, his Eton
      rearing, and his refined air, was not one of Nature's gentlemen,&mdash;the
      true secret was, that Audley Egerton moved, looked, and spoke like a
      thorough gentleman of England,&mdash;a gentleman of more than average
      talents and of long experience, speaking his sincere opinions, not a
      rhetorician aiming at effect. Moreover, Egerton was a consummate man of
      the world. He said, with nervous simplicity, what his party desired to be
      said, and put what his opponents felt to be the strong points of the case.
      Calm and decorous, yet spirited and energetic, with little variety of
      tone, and action subdued and rare, but yet signalized by earnest vigour,
      Audley Egerton impressed the understanding of the dullest, and pleased the
      taste of the most fastidious.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once, when allusions were made to a certain popular question, on which
      the premier had announced his resolution to refuse all concession, and on
      the expediency of which it was announced that the Cabinet was nevertheless
      divided, and when such allusions were coupled with direct appeals to Mr.
      Egerton, as "the enlightened member of a great commercial constituency,"
      and with a flattering doubt that "that Right Honourable gentleman, member
      for that great city, identified with the cause of the Burgher class, could
      be so far behind the spirit of the age as his official chief,"&mdash;Randal
      observed that Egerton drew his hat still more closely over his brows, and
      turned to whisper with one of his colleagues. He could not be got up to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Randal walked home with Egerton, and intimated his surprise
      that the minister had declined what seemed to him a good occasion for one
      of those brief, weighty replies by which Audley was chiefly distinguished,&mdash;an
      occasion to which he had been loudly invited by the "hears" of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leslie," answered the statesman, briefly, "I owe all my success in
      parliament to this rule,&mdash;I have never spoken against my convictions.
      I intend to abide by it to the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if the question at issue comes before the House, you will vote
      against it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, I vote as a member of the Cabinet. But since I am not leader
      and mouthpiece of the party, I retain as an individual the privilege to
      speak or keep silence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear Mr. Egerton," exclaimed Randal, "forgive me. But this
      question, right or wrong, has got such hold of the public mind. So little,
      if conceded in time, would give content; and it is so clear (if I may
      judge by the talk I hear everywhere I go) that by refusing all concession,
      the Government must fall, that I wish&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I wish," interrupted Egerton, with a gloomy, impatient sigh,&mdash;"so
      do I wish! But what avails it? If my advice had been taken but three weeks
      ago&mdash;now it is too late&mdash;we could have doubled the rock; we
      refused, we must split upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech was so unlike the discreet and reserved minister, that Randal
      gathered courage to proceed with an idea that had occurred to his own
      sagacity. And before I state it, I must add that Egerton had of late shown
      much more personal kindness to his protege; whether his spirits were
      broken, or that at last, close and compact as his nature of bronze was, he
      felt the imperious want to groan aloud in some loving ear, the stern
      Audley seemed tamed and softened. So Randal went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I say what I have heard expressed with regard to you and your
      position&mdash;in the streets, in the clubs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is in the streets and the clubs that statesmen should go to
      school. Say on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I have heard it made a matter of wonder why you, and one or
      two others I will not name, do not at once retire from the ministry, and
      on the avowed ground that you side with the public feeling on this
      irresistible question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is clear that in so doing you would become the most popular man in the
      country,&mdash;clear that you would be summoned back to power on the
      shoulders of the people. No new Cabinet could be formed without you, and
      your station in it would perhaps be higher, for life, than that which you
      may now retain but for a few weeks longer. Has not this ever occurred to
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never," said Audley, with dry composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amazed at such obtuseness, Randal exclaimed, "Is it possible! And yet,
      forgive me if I say I think you are ambitious, and love power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No man more ambitious; and if by power you mean office, it has grown the
      habit of my life, and I shall not know what to do without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how, then, has what seems to me so obvious never occurred to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you are young, and therefore I forgive you; but not the gossips
      who could wonder why Audley Egerton refused to betray the friends of his
      whole career, and to profit by the treason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But one should love one's country before a party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of that; and the first interest of a country is the honour of
      its public men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But men may leave their party without dishonour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who doubts that? Do you suppose that if I were an ordinary independent
      member of parliament, loaded with no obligations, charged with no trust, I
      could hesitate for a moment what course to pursue? Oh, that I were but the
      member for &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! Oh, that I had the full
      right to be a free agent! But if a member of a Cabinet, a chief in whom
      thousands confide, because he is outvoted in a council of his colleagues,
      suddenly retires, and by so doing breaks up the whole party whose
      confidence he has enjoyed, whose rewards he has reaped, to whom he owes
      the very position which he employs to their ruin,&mdash;own that though
      his choice may be honest, it is one which requires all the consolations of
      conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will have those consolations. And," added Randal, energetically,
      "the gain to your career will be so immense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is precisely what it cannot be," answered Egerton, gloomily. "I
      grant that I may, if I choose, resign office with the present Government,
      and so at once destroy that Government; for my resignation on such ground
      would suffice to do it. I grant this; but for that very reason I could not
      the next day take office with another administration. I could not accept
      wages for desertion. No gentleman could! and therefore&mdash;" Audley
      stopped short, and buttoned his coat over his broad breast. The action was
      significant; it said that the man's mind was made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, whether Audley Egerton was right or wrong in his theory depends
      upon much subtler, and perhaps loftier, views in the casuistry of
      political duties, than it was in his character to take. And I guard myself
      from saying anything in praise or disfavour of his notions, or implying
      that he is a fit or unfit example in a parallel case. I am but describing
      the man as he was, and as a man like him would inevitably be, under the
      influences in which he lived, and in that peculiar world of which he was
      so emphatically a member. "Ce n'est pas moi qui parle, c'est Marc Aurele."
    </p>
    <p>
      He speaks, not I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal had no time for further discussion. They now reached Egerton's
      house, and the minister, taking the chamber candlestick from his servant's
      hand, nodded a silent goodnight to Leslie, and with a jaded look retired
      to his room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      But not on the threatened question was that eventful campaign of Party
      decided. The Government fell less in battle than skirmish. It was one
      fatal Monday&mdash;a dull question of finance and figures. Prosy and few
      were the speakers,&mdash;all the Government silent, save the Chancellor of
      the Exchequer, and another business-like personage connected with the
      Board of Trade, whom the House would hardly condescend to hear. The House
      was in no mood to think of facts and figures. Early in the evening,
      between nine and ten, the Speaker's sonorous voice sounded, "Strangers
      must withdraw!" And Randal, anxious and foreboding, descended from his
      seat and went out of the fatal doors. He turned to take a last glance at
      Audley Egerton. The whipper-in was whispering to Audley; and the minister
      pushed back his hat from his brows, and glanced round the House, and up
      into the galleries, as if to calculate rapidly the relative numbers of the
      two armies in the field; then he smiled bitterly, and threw himself back
      into his seat. That smile long haunted Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the strangers thus banished with Randal, while the division was
      being taken, were many young men, like himself, connected with the
      administration,&mdash;some by blood, some by place. Hearts beat loud in
      the swarming lobbies. Ominous mournful whispers were exchanged. "They say
      the Government will have a majority of ten." "No; I hear they will
      certainly be beaten." "H&mdash;says by fifty." "I don't believe it," said
      a Lord of the Bedchamber; "it is impossible. I left five Government
      members dining at The Travellers." "No one thought the division would be
      so early." "A trick of the Whigs-shameful!" "Wonder some one was not set
      up to talk for time; very odd P&mdash;did not speak; however, he is so
      cursedly rich, he does not care whether he is out or in." "Yes; and Audley
      Egerton too, just such another: glad, no doubt, to be set free to look
      after his property; very different tactics if we had men to whom office
      was as necessary as it is&mdash;to me!" said a candid young placeman.
      Suddenly the silent Leslie felt a friendly grasp on his arm. He turned and
      saw Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I not tell you?" said the baron, with an exulting smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sure, then, that the Government will be outvoted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I spent the morning in going over the list of members with a
      parliamentary client of mine, who knows them all as a shepherd does his
      sheep. Majority for the Opposition at least twenty-five."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in that case must the Government resign, sir?" asked the candid young
      placeman, who had been listening to the smart, well-dressed baron, "his
      soul planted in his ears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sir," replied the baron, blandly, and offering his snuff-box
      (true Louis Quinze, with a miniature of Madame de Pompadour, set in
      pearls). "You are a friend to the present ministers? You could not wish
      them to be mean enough to stay in?" Randal drew aside the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Audley's affairs are as you state, what can he do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall ask him that question to-morrow," answered the baron, with a look
      of visible hate; "and I have come here just to see how he bears the
      prospect before him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not discover that in his face. And those absurd scruples of his!
      If he had but gone out in time&mdash;to come in again with the New Men!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course, our Right Honourable is too punctilious for that!"
      answered the baron, sneering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the doors opened, in rushed the breathless expectants. "What are
      the numbers? What is the division?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Majority against ministers," said a member of Opposition, peeling an
      orange, "twenty-nine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron, too, had a Speaker's order; and he came into the House with
      Randal, and sat by his side. But, to their disgust, some member was
      talking about the other motions before the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! has nothing been said as to the division?" asked the baron of a
      young county member, who was talking to some non-parliamentary friend in
      the bench before Levy. The county member was one of the baron's pet eldest
      sons, had dined often with Levy, was under "obligations" to him. The young
      legislator looked very much ashamed of Levy's friendly pat on his
      shoulder, and answered hurriedly, "Oh, yes; H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; asked
      if, after such an expression of the House, it was the intention of
      ministers to retain their places, and carry on the business of the
      Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-! Very inquisitive mind! And what was
      the answer he got?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None," said the county member; and returned in haste to his proper seat
      in the body of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There comes Egerton," said the baron. And, indeed, as most of the members
      were now leaving the House, to talk over affairs at clubs or in saloons,
      and spread through town the great tidings, Audley Egerton's tall head was
      seen towering above the rest. And Levy turned away disappointed. For not
      only was the minister's handsome face, though pale, serene and cheerful,
      but there was an obvious courtesy, a marked respect, in the mode in which
      that assembly&mdash;heated though it was&mdash;made way for the fallen
      minister as he passed through the jostling crowd. And the frank urbane
      nobleman, who afterwards, from the force, not of talent but of character,
      became the leader in that House, pressed the hand of his old opponent, as
      they met in the throng near the doors, and said aloud, "I shall not be a
      proud man if ever I live to have office; but I shall be proud if ever I
      leave it with as little to be said against me as your bitterest opponents
      can say against you, Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," exclaimed the baron, aloud, and leaning over the partition
      that divided him from the throng below, so that his voice reached Egerton&mdash;and
      there was a cry from formal, indignant members, "Order in the strangers'
      gallery I wonder what Lord L'Estrange will say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley lifted his dark brows, surveyed the baron for an instant with
      flashing eyes, then walked down the narrow defile between the last
      benches, and vanished from the scene, in which, alas! so few of the most
      admired performers leave more than an actor's short-lived name!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Baron Levy did not execute his threat of calling on Egerton the next
      morning. Perhaps he shrank from again meeting the flash of those indignant
      eyes. And indeed Egerton was too busied all the forenoon to see any one
      not upon public affairs, except Harley, who hastened to console or cheer
      him. When the House met, it was announced that the ministers had resigned,
      only holding their offices till their successors were appointed. But
      already there was some reaction in their favour; and when it became
      generally known that the new administration was to be formed of men few
      indeed of whom had ever before held office, the common superstition in the
      public mind that government is like a trade, in which a regular
      apprenticeship must be served, began to prevail; and the talk at the clubs
      was that the new men could not stand; that the former ministry, with some
      modification, would be back in a month. Perhaps that too might be a reason
      why Baron Levy thought it prudent not prematurely to offer vindictive
      condolences to Mr. Egerton. Randal spent part of his morning in inquiries
      as to what gentlemen in his situation meant to do with regard to their
      places; he heard with great satisfaction that very few intended to
      volunteer retirement from their desks. As Randal himself had observed to
      Egerton, "Their country before their party!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's place was of great moment to him; its duties were easy, its
      salary amply sufficient for his wants, and defrayed such expenses as were
      bestowed on the education of Oliver and his sister. For I am bound to do
      justice to this young man,&mdash;indifferent as he was towards his species
      in general, the ties of family were strong with him; and he stinted
      himself in many temptations most alluring to his age, in the endeavour to
      raise the dull honest Oliver and the loose-haired pretty Juliet somewhat
      more to his own level of culture and refinement. Men essentially griping
      and unscrupulous often do make the care for their family an apology for
      their sins against the world. Even Richard III., if the chroniclers are to
      be trusted, excused the murder of his nephews by his passionate affection
      for his son. With the loss of that place, Randal lost all means of
      support, save what Audley could give him; and if Audley were in truth
      ruined? Moreover, Randal had already established at the office a
      reputation for ability and industry. It was a career in which, if he
      abstained from party politics, he might rise to a fair station and to a
      considerable income. Therefore, much contented with what he learned as to
      the general determination of his fellow officials, a determination
      warranted by ordinary precedent in such cases, Randal dined at a club with
      good relish, and much Christian resignation for the reverse of his patron,
      and then walked to Grosvenor Square, on the chance of finding Audley
      within. Learning that he was so, from the porter who opened the door,
      Randal entered the library. Three gentlemen were seated there with
      Egerton: one of the three was Lord L'Estrange; the other two were members
      of the really defunct, though nominally still existing, Government. He was
      about to withdraw from intruding on this conclave, when Egerton said to
      him gently, "Come in, Leslie; I was just speaking about yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About me, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; about you and the place you hold. I had asked Sir &mdash;&mdash;
      [pointing to a fellow minister] whether I might not, with propriety,
      request your chief to leave some note of his opinion of your talents,
      which I know is high, and which might serve you with his successor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir, at such a time to think of me!" exclaimed Randal, and he was
      genuinely touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," resumed Audley, with his usual dryness, "Sir &mdash;&mdash;, to my
      surprise, thinks that it would better become you that you should resign.
      Unless his reasons, which he has not yet stated, are very strong, such
      would not be my advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My reasons," said Sir &mdash;&mdash;, with official formality, "are
      simply these: I have a nephew in a similar situation; he will resign, as a
      matter of course. Every one in the public offices whose relations and near
      connections hold high appointments in the Government will do so. I do not
      think Mr. Leslie will like to feel himself a solitary exception."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Leslie is no relation of mine,&mdash;not even a near connection,"
      answered Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But his name is so associated with your own: he has resided so long in
      your house, is so well known in society (and don't think I compliment when
      I add, that we hope so well of him), that I can't think it worth his while
      to keep this paltry place, which incapacitates him too from a seat in
      parliament."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir &mdash;&mdash; was one of those terribly rich men, to whom all
      considerations of mere bread and cheese are paltry. But I must add that he
      supposed Egerton to be still wealthier than himself, and sure to provide
      handsomely for Randal, whom Sir &mdash;&mdash; rather liked than not; and
      for Randal's own sake, Sir &mdash;&mdash; thought it would lower him in
      the estimation of Egerton himself, despite that gentleman's advocacy, if
      he did not follow the example of his avowed and notorious patron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Leslie," said Egerton, checking Randal's meditated reply, "that
      nothing can be said against your honour if you stay where you are; it is a
      mere question of expediency; I will judge that for you; keep your place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily the other member of the Government, who had hitherto been
      silent, was a literary man. Unhappily, while this talk had proceeded, he
      had placed his hand upon Randal Leslie's celebrated pamphlet, which lay on
      the library table; and, turning over the leaves, the whole spirit and
      matter of that masterly composition in defence of the administration (a
      composition steeped in all the essence of party) recurred to his too
      faithful recollection. He, too, liked Randal; he did more,&mdash;he
      admired the author of that striking and effective pamphlet. And therefore,
      rousing himself from the sublime indifference he had before felt for the
      fate of a subaltern, he said, with a bland and complimentary smile, "No; the
      writer of this most able publication is no ordinary placeman. His opinions
      here are too vigorously stated; this fine irony on the very person who in
      all probability will be the chief in his office has excited too lively an
      attention to allow him the sedet eternumque sedebit on an official stool.
      Ha, ha! this is so good! Read it, L'Estrange. What say you?" Harley
      glanced over the page pointed out to him. The original was in one of
      Burley's broad, coarse, but telling burlesques, strained fine through
      Randal's more polished satire. It was capital. Harley smiled, and lifted
      his eyes to Randal. The unlucky plagiarist's face was flushed,&mdash;the
      beads stood on his brow. Harley was a good hater; he loved too warmly not
      to err on the opposite side; but he was one of those men who forget hate
      when its object is distressed and humbled. He put down the pamphlet and
      said, "I am no politician; but Egerton is so well known to be fastidious
      and over-scrupulous in all points of official etiquette, that Mr. Leslie
      cannot follow a safer counsellor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read that yourself, Egerton," said Sir &mdash;&mdash;; and he pushed the
      pamphlet to Audley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Egerton had a dim recollection that that pamphlet was unlucky; but he
      had skimmed over its contents hastily, and at that moment had forgotten
      all about it. He took up the too famous work with a reluctant hand, but he
      read attentively the passages pointed out to him, and then said gravely
      and sadly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Leslie, I retract my advice. I believe Sir &mdash;&mdash; is right,&mdash;that
      the nobleman here so keenly satirized will be the chief in your office. I
      doubt whether he will not compel your dismissal; at all events, he could
      scarcely be expected to promote your advancement. Under the circumstances,
      I fear you have no option as a&mdash;" Egerton paused a moment, and, with
      a sigh that seemed to settle the question, concluded with&mdash;"as a
      gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did Jack Cade, never did Wat Tyler, feel a more deadly hate to that
      word "gentleman" than the well-born Leslie felt then; but he bowed his
      head, and answered with his usual presence of mind,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You utter my own sentiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think we are right, Harley?" asked Egerton, with an irresolution that
      surprised all present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," answered Harley, with a compassion for Randal that was almost
      over-generous, and yet with an equivoque on the words, despite the
      compassion,&mdash;"I think whoever has served Audley Egerton never yet has
      been a loser by it; and if Mr. Leslie wrote this pamphlet, he must have
      well served Audley Egerton. If he undergoes the penalty, we may safely
      trust to Egerton for the compensation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My compensation has long since been made," answered Randal, with grace;
      "and that Mr. Egerton could thus have cared for my fortunes, at an hour so
      occupied, is a thought of pride which&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough, Leslie! enough!" interrupted Egerton, rising and pressing his
      protege's hand. "See me before you go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two other ministers rose also and shook hands with Leslie, and
      told him he had done the right thing, and that they hoped soon to see him
      in parliament; and hinted, smilingly, that the next administration did not
      promise to be very long-lived; and one asked him to dinner, and the other
      to spend a week at his country-seat. And amidst these congratulations at
      the stroke that left him penniless, the distinguished pamphleteer left the
      room. How he cursed big John Burley!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was past midnight when Audley Egerton summoned Randal. The statesman
      was then alone, seated before his great desk, with its manifold
      compartments, and engaged on the task of transferring various papers and
      letters, some to the waste-basket, some to the flames, some to two great
      iron chests with patent locks, that stood, open-mouthed, at his feet.
      Strong, stern, and grim looked those iron chests, silently receiving the
      relics of power departed; strong, stern, and grim as the grave. Audley
      lifted his eyes at Randal's entrance, signed to him to take a chair,
      continued his task for a few moments, and then turning round, as if by an
      effort he plucked himself from his master-passion,&mdash;Public Life, he
      said, with deliberate tones,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not, Randal Leslie, whether you thought me needlessly cautious, or
      wantonly unkind, when I told you never to expect from me more than such
      advance to your career as my then position could effect,&mdash;never to
      expect from my liberality in life, nor from my testament in death, an
      addition to your private fortunes. I see by your gesture what would be
      your reply, and I thank you for it. I now tell you, as yet in confidence,
      though before long it can be no secret to the world, that my pecuniary
      affairs have been so neglected by me in my devotion to those of the State,
      that I am somewhat like the man who portioned out his capital at so much a
      day, calculating to live just long enough to make it last. Unfortunately
      he lived too long." Audley smiled&mdash;but the smile was cold as a
      sunbeam upon ice-and went on with the same firm, unfaltering accents. "The
      prospects that face me I am prepared for; they do not take me by surprise.
      I knew long since how this would end, if I survived the loss of office. I
      knew it before you came to me, and therefore I spoke to you as I did,
      judging it manful and right to guard you against hopes which you might
      otherwise have naturally entertained. On this head, I need say no more. It
      may excite your surprise, possibly your blame, that I, esteemed methodical
      and practical enough in the affairs of the State, should be so imprudent
      as to my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir! you owe no account to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you, at least, as much as to any one. I am a solitary man; my few
      relations need nothing from me. I had a right do spend what I possessed as
      I pleased; and if I have spent it recklessly as regards myself, I have not
      spent it ill in its effect on others. It has been my object for many years
      to have no Private Life,&mdash;to dispense with its sorrows, joys,
      affections; and as to its duties, they did not exist for me. I have said."
      Mechanically, as he ended, the minister's hand closed the lid of one of
      the iron boxes, and on the closed lid he rested his firm foot. "But now,"
      he resumed, "I have failed to advance your career. True, I warned you that
      you drew into a lottery; but you had more chance of a prize than a blank.
      A blank, however, it has turned out, and the question becomes grave,&mdash;What
      are you to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, seeing that Egerton came to a full pause, Randal answered readily,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, sir, to go by your advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My advice," said Audley, with a softened look, "would perhaps be rude and
      unpalatable. I would rather place before you an option. On the one hand,
      recommence life again. I told you that I would keep your name on your
      college books. You can return, you can take your degree, after that, you
      can go to the Bar,&mdash;you have just the talents calculated to succeed
      in that profession. Success will be slow, it is true; but, with
      perseverance, it will be sure. And, believe me, Leslie, Ambition is only
      sweet while it is but the loftier name for Hope. Who would care for a
      fox's brush if it had not been rendered a prize by the excitement of the
      chase?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oxford&mdash;again! It is a long step back in life," said Randal,
      drearily, and little heeding Egerton's unusual indulgence of illustration.
      "A long step back&mdash;and to what? To a profession in which one never
      begins to rise till one's hair is gray. Besides, how live in the mean
      while?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not let that thought disturb you. The modest income that suffices for
      a student at the Bar, I trust, at least, to insure you from the wrecks of
      my fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir, I would not burden you further. What right have I to such
      kindness, save my name of Leslie?" And in spite of himself, as Randal
      concluded, a tone of bitterness, that betrayed reproach, broke forth.
      Egerton was too much the man of the world not to comprehend the reproach,
      and not to pardon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," he answered calmly, "as a Leslie you are entitled to my
      consideration, and would have been entitled perhaps to more, had I not so
      explicitly warned you to the contrary. But the Bar does not seem to please
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the alternative, sir? Let me decide when I hear it," answered
      Randal, sullenly. He began to lose respect for the roan who owned he could
      do so little for him, and who evidently recommended him to shift for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one could have pierced into Egerton's gloomy heart as he noted the
      young man's change of tone, it may be a doubt whether one would have seen
      there pain or pleasure,&mdash;pain, for merely from the force of habit he
      had begun to like Randal, or pleasure at the thought that he might have
      reason to withdraw that liking. So lone and stoical had grown the man who
      had made it his object to have no private life! Revealing, however,
      neither pleasure nor pain, but with the composed calmness of a judge upon
      the bench, Egerton replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The alternative is, to continue in the course you have begun, and still
      to rely on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, my dear Mr. Egerton," exclaimed Randal, regaining all his usual
      tenderness of look and voice, "rely on you! But that is all I ask. Only"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only, you would say, I am going out of power, and you don't see the
      chance of my return?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not mean that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me to suppose that you did: very true; but the party I belong to
      is as sure of return as the pendulum of that clock is sure to obey the
      mechanism that moves it from left to right. Our successors profess to come
      in upon a popular question. All administrations who do that are
      necessarily short-lived. Either they do not go far enough to please
      present supporters, or they go so far as to arm new enemies in the rivals
      who outbid them with the people. 'T is the history of all revolutions, and
      of all reforms. Our own administration in reality is destroyed for having
      passed what was called a popular measure a year ago, which lost us half
      our friends, and refusing to propose another popular measure this year, in
      the which we are outstripped by the men who hallooed us on to the last.
      Therefore, whatever our successors do, we shall by the law of reaction,
      have another experiment of power afforded to ourselves. It is but a
      question of time; you can wait for it,&mdash;whether I can is uncertain.
      But if I die before that day arrives, I have influence enough still left
      with those who will come in, to obtain a promise of a better provision for
      you than that which you have lost. The promises of public men are
      proverbially uncertain; but I shall entrust your cause to a man who never
      failed a friend, and whose rank will enable him to see that justice is
      done to you,&mdash;I speak of Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not he; he is unjust to me; he dislikes me; he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May dislike you (he has his whims), but he loves me; and though for no
      other human being but you would I ask Harley L'Estrange a favour, yet for
      you I will," said Egerton, betraying, for the first time in that dialogue,
      a visible emotion,&mdash;"for you, a Leslie, a kinsman, however remote, to
      the wife from whom I received my fortune! And despite all my cautions, it
      is possible that in wasting that fortune I may have wronged you. Enough:
      you have now before you the two options, much as you had at first; but you
      have at present more experience to aid you in your choice. You are a man,
      and with more brains than most men; think over it well, and decide for
      yourself. Now to bed, and postpone thought till the morrow. Poor Randal,
      you look pale!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley, as he said the last words, put his hand on Randal's shoulder,
      almost with a father's gentleness; and then suddenly drawing himself up,
      as the hard inflexible expression, stamped on that face by years,
      returned, he moved away and resettled to Public Life and the iron box.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early the next day Randal Leslie was in the luxurious business-room of
      Baron Levy. How unlike the cold Doric simplicity of the statesman's
      library! Axminster carpets, three inches thick; portieres a la Francaise
      before the doors; Parisian bronzes on the chimney-piece; and all the
      receptacles that lined the room, and contained title-deeds and postobits
      and bills and promises to pay and lawyer-like japan boxes, with many a
      noble name written thereon in large white capitals&mdash;"making ruin
      pompous," all these sepulchres of departed patrimonies veneered in
      rosewood that gleamed with French polish, and blazed with ormulu. There
      was a coquetry, an air of petit maitre, so diffused over the whole room,
      that you could not, for the life of you, recollect you were with a usurer!
      Plutus wore the aspect of his enemy Cupid; and how realize your idea of
      Harpagon in that baron, with his easy French "Mon cher," and his white,
      warm hands that pressed yours so genially, and his dress so exquisite,
      even at the earliest morn? No man ever yet saw that baron in a
      dressing-gown and slippers! As one fancies some feudal baron of old (not
      half so terrible) everlastingly clad in mail, so all one's notions of this
      grand marauder of civilization were inseparably associated with varnished
      boots and a camellia in the button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is all that he does for you!" cried the baron, pressing together
      the points of his ten taper fingers. "Had he but let you conclude your
      career at Oxford, I have heard enough of your scholarship to know that you
      would have taken high honours, been secure of a fellowship, have betaken
      yourself with content to a slow and laborious profession, and prepared
      yourself to die on the woolsack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He proposes to me now to return to Oxford," said Randal. "It is not too
      late!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is," said the baron. "Neither individuals nor nations ever go
      back of their own accord. There must be an earthquake before a river
      recedes to its source."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak well," answered Randal, "and I cannot gainsay you. But now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, the now is the grand question in life, the then is obsolete, gone by,&mdash;out
      of fashion; and now, mon cher, you come to ask my advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Baron, I come to ask your explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to know why you spoke to me of Mr. Egerton's ruin; why you spoke
      to me of the lands to be sold by Mr. Thornhill; and why you spoke to me of
      Count Peschiera. You touched on each of those points within ten minutes,
      you omitted to indicate what link can connect them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Jove," said the baron, rising, and with more admiration in his face
      than you could have conceived that face, so smiling and so cynical, could
      exhibit,&mdash;"by Jove, Randal Leslie, but your shrewdness is wonderful.
      You really are the first young man of your day; and I will 'help you,' as
      I helped Audley Egerton. Perhaps you will be more grateful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal thought of Egerton's ruin. The parallel implied by the baron did
      not suggest to him the rare enthusiasm of gratitude. However, he merely
      said, "Pray, proceed; I listen to you with interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for politics, then," said the baron, "we will discuss that topic
      later. I am waiting myself to see how these new men get on. The first
      consideration is for your private fortunes. You should buy this ancient
      Leslie property&mdash;Rood and Dulmansberry&mdash;only L20,000 down; the
      rest may remain on mortgage forever&mdash;or at least till I find you a
      rich wife,&mdash;as in fact I did for Egerton. Thornhill wants the L20,000
      now,&mdash;wants them very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And where," said Randal, with an iron smile, "are the L20,000 you ascribe
      to me to come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten thousand shall come to you the day Count Peschiera marries the
      daughter of his kinsman with your help and aid; the remaining ten thousand
      I will lend you. No scruple, I shall hazard nothing, the estates will bear
      that additional burden. What say you,&mdash;shall it be so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten thousand pounds from Count Peschiera!" said Randal, breathing hard.
      "You cannot be serious? Such a sum&mdash;for what?&mdash;for a mere piece
      of information? How otherwise can I aid him? There must be trick and
      deception intended here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," answered Levy, "I will give you a hint. There is such a
      thing in life as being over-suspicious. If you have a fault, it is that.
      The information you allude to is, of course, the first assistance you are
      to give. Perhaps more may be needed, perhaps not. Of that you will judge
      yourself, since the L10,000 are contingent on the marriage aforesaid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over-suspicious or not," answered Randal, "the amount of the sum is too
      improbable, and the security too bad, for me to listen to this
      proposition, even if I could descend to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, mon cher. Business first, scruples afterwards. The security too
      bad; what security?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The word of Count di Peschiera."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has nothing to do with it, he need know nothing about it. 'T is my
      word you doubt. I am your security."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal thought of that dry witticism in Gibbon, "Abu Rafe says he will be
      witness for this fact, but who will be witness for Abu Rafe?" but he
      remained silent, only fixing on Levy those dark observant eyes, with their
      contracted, wary pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is simply this," resumed Levy: "Count di Peschiera has promised
      to pay his sister a dowry of L20,000, in case he has the money to spare.
      He can only have it to spare by the marriage we are discussing. On my
      part, as I manage his affairs in England for him, I have promised that,
      for the said sum of L20,000, I will guarantee the expenses in the way of
      that marriage, and settle with Madame di Negra. Now, though Peschiera is a
      very liberal, warm-hearted fellow, I don't say that he would have named so
      large a sum for his sister's dowry, if in strict truth he did not owe it
      to her. It is the amount of her own fortune, which by some arrangements
      with her late husband, not exactly legal, he possessed himself of. If
      Madame di Negra went to law with him for it, she could get it back. I have
      explained this to him; and, in short, you now understand why the sum is
      thus assessed. But I have bought up Madame di Negra's debts, I have bought
      up young Hazeldean's (for we must make a match between these two a part of
      our arrangements). I shall present to Peschiera, and to these excellent
      young persons, an account that will absorb the whole L20,000. That sum
      will come into my hands. If I settle the claims against them for half the
      money, which, making myself the sole creditor, I have the right to do, the
      moiety will remain. And if I choose to give it to you in return for the
      services which provide Peschiera with a princely fortune, discharge the
      debts of his sister, and secure her a husband in my promising young
      client, Mr. Hazeldean, that is my lookout,&mdash;all parties are
      satisfied, and no one need ever be the wiser. The sum is large, no doubt;
      it answers to me to give it to you; does it answer to you to receive it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal was greatly agitated; but vile as he was, and systematically as in
      thought he had brought himself to regard others merely as they could be
      made subservient to his own interest, still, with all who have not
      hardened themselves in actual crime, there is a wide distinction between
      the thought and the act; and though, in the exercise of ingenuity and
      cunning, he would have had few scruples in that moral swindling which is
      mildly called "outwitting another," yet thus nakedly and openly to accept
      a bribe for a deed of treachery towards the poor Italian who had so
      generously trusted him&mdash;he recoiled. He was nerving himself to
      refuse, when Levy, opening his pocket-book, glanced over the memoranda
      therein, and said, as to himself, "Rood Manor&mdash;Dulmansberry, sold to
      the Thornhills by Sir Gilbert Leslie, knight of the shire; estimated
      present net rental L2,250 7s. 0d. It is the greatest bargain I ever knew.
      And with this estate in hand, and your talents, Leslie, I don't see why
      you should not rise higher than Audley Egerton. He was poorer than you
      once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Leslie lands&mdash;a positive stake in the country&mdash;the
      restoration of the fallen family; and on the other hand, either long
      drudgery at the Bar,&mdash;a scanty allowance on Egerton's bounty, his
      sister wasting her youth at slovenly, dismal Rood, Oliver debased into a
      boor!&mdash;or a mendicant's dependence on the contemptuous pity of Harley
      L'Estrange,&mdash;Harley, who had refused his hand to him, Harley, who
      perhaps would become the husband of Violante! Rage seized him as these
      contrasting pictures rose before his view. He walked to and fro in
      disorder, striving to re-collect his thoughts, and reduce himself from the
      passions of the human heart into the mere mechanism of calculating
      intellect. "I cannot conceive," said he, abruptly, "why you should tempt
      me thus,&mdash;what interest it is to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Baron Levy smiled, and put up his pocket-book. He saw from that moment
      that the victory was gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," said he, with the most agreeable bonhommie, "it is very
      natural that you should think a man would have a personal interest in
      whatever he does for another. I believe that view of human nature is
      called utilitarian philosophy, and is much in fashion at present. Let me
      try and explain to you. In this affair I sha'n't injure myself. True, you
      will say, if I settle claims which amount to L20,000 for L10,000, I might
      put the surplus into my own pocket instead of yours. Agreed. But I shall
      not get the L20,000, nor repay myself Madame di Negra's debts (whatever I
      may do as to Hazeldean's), unless the count gets this heiress. You can
      help in this. I want you; and I don't think I could get you by a less
      offer than I make. I shall soon pay myself back the L10,000 if the count
      get hold of the lady and her fortune. Brief, I see my way here to my own
      interests. Do you want more reasons,&mdash;you shall have them. I am now a
      very rich man. How have I become so? Through attaching myself from the
      first to persons of expectations, whether from fortune or talent. I have
      made connections in society, and society has enriched me. I have still a
      passion for making money. 'Que voulez-vous?' It is my profession, my
      hobby. It will be useful to me in a thousand ways to secure as a friend a
      young man who will have influence with other young men, heirs to something
      better than Rood Hall. You may succeed in public life. A man in public
      life may attain to the knowledge of State secrets that are very profitable
      to one who dabbles a little in the Funds. We can perhaps hereafter do
      business together that may put yourself in a way of clearing off all
      mortgages on these estates,&mdash;on the encumbered possession of which I
      shall soon congratulate you. You see I am frank; 't is the only way of
      coming to the point with so clever a fellow as you. And now, since the
      less we rake up the mud in a pond from which we have resolved to drink the
      better, let us dismiss all other thoughts but that of securing our end.
      Will you tell Peschiera where the young lady is, or shall I? Better do it
      yourself; reason enough for it, that he has confided to you his hope, and
      asked you to help him; why should not you? Not a word to him about our
      little arrangement; he need never know it. You need never be troubled."
      Levy rang the bell: "Order my carriage round."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal made no objection. He was deathlike pale, but there was a sinister
      expression of firmness on his thin, bloodless lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next point," Levy resumed, "is to hasten the match between Frank and
      the fair widow. How does that stand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will not see me, nor receive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, learn why! And if you find on either side there is a hitch, just let
      me know; I will soon remove it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Hazeldean consented to the post-obit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet; I have not pressed it; I wait the right moment, if necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you wish it. It shall be so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie again paced the room, and after a silent self-commune came
      up close to the baron, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look you, sir, I am poor and ambitious; you have tempted me at the right
      moment, and with the right inducement. I succumb. But what guarantee have
      I that this money will be paid, these estates made mine upon the
      conditions stipulated?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before anything is settled," replied the baron, "go and ask my character
      of any of our young friends, Borrowell, Spendquick&mdash;whom you please;
      you will hear me abused, of course; but they will all say this of me, that
      when I pass my word, I keep it. If I say, 'Mon cher, you shall have the
      money,' a man has it; if I say, 'I renew your bill for six months,' it is
      renewed. 'T, is my way of doing business. In all cases any word is my
      bond. In this case, where no writing can pass between us, my only bond
      must be my word. Go, then, make your mind clear as to your security, and
      come here and dine at eight. We will call on Peschiera afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Randal, "I will at all events take the day to consider.
      Meanwhile, I say this, I do not disguise from myself the nature of the
      proposed transaction, but what I have once resolved I go through with. My
      sole vindication to myself is, that if I play here with a false die, it
      will be for a stake so grand, as once won, the magnitude of the prize will
      cancel the ignominy of the play. It is not this sum of money for which I
      sell myself,&mdash;it is for what that sum will aid me to achieve. And in
      the marriage of young Hazeldean with the Italian woman, I have another,
      and it may be a larger interest. I have slept on it lately,&mdash;I wake
      to it now. Insure that marriage, obtain the post-obit. from Hazeldean, and
      whatever the issue of the more direct scheme for which you seek my
      services, rely on my gratitude, and believe that you will have put me in
      the way to render gratitude of avail. At eight I will be with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron sat thoughtful. "It is true," said he to himself, "this young
      man is the next of kin to the Hazeldean estate, if Frank displease his
      father sufficiently to lose his inheritance; that must be the clever boy's
      design. Well, in the long-run, I should make as much, or more, out of him
      than out of the spendthrift Frank. Frank's faults are those of youth. He
      will reform and retrench. But this man! No, I shall have him for life. And
      should he fail in this project, and have but this encumbered property&mdash;a
      landed proprietor mortgaged up to his ears&mdash;why, he is my slave, and
      I can foreclose when I wish, or if he prove useless;&mdash;no, I risk
      nothing. And if I did&mdash;if I lost L10,000&mdash;what then? I can
      afford it for revenge!&mdash;afford it for the luxury of leaving Audley
      Egerton alone with penury and ruin, deserted, in his hour of need, by the
      pensioner of his bounty, as he will be by the last friend of his youth,
      when it so pleases me,&mdash;me whom he has called 'scoundrel'! and whom
      he&mdash;" Levy's soliloquy halted there, for the servant entered to
      announce the carriage. And the baron hurried his band over his features,
      as if to sweep away all trace of the passions that distorted their smiling
      effrontery. And so, as he took up his cane and gloves, and glanced at the
      glass, the face of the fashionable usurer was once more as varnished as
      his boots.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When a clever man resolves on a villanous action, he hastens, by the
      exercise of his cleverness, to get rid of the sense of his villany. With
      more than his usual alertness, Randal employed the next hour or two in
      ascertaining how far Baron Levy merited the character he boasted, and how
      far his word might be his bond. He repaired to young men whom he esteemed
      better judges on these points than Spendquick and Borrowell,&mdash;young
      men who resembled the Merry Monarch, inasmuch as&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "They never said a foolish thing,
          And never did a wise one."
</pre>
    <p>
      There are many such young men about town,&mdash;sharp and able in all
      affairs except their own. No one knows the world better, nor judges of
      character more truly, than your half-beggared roue. From all these Baron
      Levy obtained much the same testimonials: he was ridiculed as a would-be
      dandy, but respected as a very responsible man of business, and rather
      liked as a friendly, accommodating species of the Sir Epicure Mammon, who
      very often did what were thought handsome, liberal things; and, "in
      short," said one of these experienced referees, "he is the best fellow
      going&mdash;for a money-lender! You may always rely on what he promises,
      and he is generally very forbearing and indulgent to us of good society;
      perhaps for the same reason that our tailors are,&mdash;to send one of us
      to prison would hurt his custom. His foible is to be thought a gentleman.
      I believe, much as I suppose he loves money, he would give up half his
      fortune rather than do anything for which we could cut him. He allows a
      pension of three hundred a year to Lord S&mdash;&mdash;-. True; he was his
      man of business for twenty years, and before then S&mdash;&mdash;- was
      rather a prudent fellow, and had fifteen thousand a year. He has helped
      on, too, many a clever young man,&mdash;the best borough-monger you ever
      knew. He likes having friends in parliament. In fact, of course he is a
      rogue; but if one wants a rogue, one can't find a pleasanter. I should
      like to see him on the French stage,&mdash;a prosperous Macaire; Le Maitre
      could hit him off to the life."
    </p>
    <p>
      From information in these more fashionable quarters, gleaned with his
      usual tact, Randal turned to a source less elevated, but to which he
      attached more importance. Dick Avenel associated with the baron,&mdash;Dick
      Avenel must be in his clutches. Now Randal did justice to that gentleman's
      practical shrewdness. Moreover, Avenel was by profession a man of
      business. He must know more of Levy than these men of pleasure could; and
      as he was a plain-spoken person, and evidently honest, in the ordinary
      acceptation of the word, Randal did not doubt that out of Dick Avenel he
      should get the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving in Eaton Square, and asking for Mr. Avenel, Randal was at once
      ushered into the drawing-room. The apartment was not in such good, solid,
      mercantile taste as had characterized Avenel's more humble bachelor's
      residence at Screwstown. The taste now was the Honourable Mrs. Avenel's;
      and, truth to say, no taste could be worse. Furniture of all epochs
      heterogeneously clumped together,&mdash;here a sofa a la renaissance in
      Gobelin; there a rosewood Console from Gillow; a tall mock-Elizabethan
      chair in black oak, by the side of a modern Florentine table of Mosaic
      marbles; all kinds of colours in the room, and all at war with each other;
      very bad copies of the best-known pictures in the world in the most gaudy
      frames, and impudently labelled by the names of their murdered originals,&mdash;"Raphael,"
      "Corregio," "Titian," "Sebastian del Piombo." Nevertheless, there had been
      plenty of money spent, and there was plenty to show for it. Mrs. Avenel
      was seated on her sofa a la renaissance, with one of her children at her
      feet, who was employed in reading a new Annual in crimson silk binding.
      Mrs. Avenel was in an attitude as if sitting for her portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polite society is most capricious in its adoptions or rejections. You see
      many a very vulgar person firmly established in the beau monde; others,
      with very good pretensions as to birth, fortune, etc., either rigorously
      excluded, or only permitted a peep over the pales. The Honourable Mrs.
      Avenel belonged to families unquestionably noble, both by her own descent
      and by her first marriage; and if poverty had kept her down in her earlier
      career, she now, at least, did not want wealth to back her pretensions.
      Nevertheless, all the dispensers of fashion concurred in refusing their
      support to the Honourable Mrs. Avenel. One might suppose it was solely on
      account of her plebeian husband; but indeed it was not so. Many a woman of
      high family can marry a low-born man not so presentable as Avenel, and, by
      the help of his money, get the fine world at her feet. But Mrs. Avenel had
      not that art. She was still a very handsome, showy woman; and as for
      dress, no duchess could be more extravagant. Yet these very circumstances
      had perhaps gone against her ambition; for your quiet little plain woman,
      provoking no envy, slips into coteries, when a handsome, flaunting lady&mdash;whom,
      once seen in your drawing-room, can be no more over-looked than a scarlet
      poppy amidst a violet bed&mdash;is pretty sure to be weeded out as
      ruthlessly as a poppy would be in a similar position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Avenel was sitting by the fire, rather moodily, his hands in his
      pockets, and whistling to himself. To say truth, that active mind of his
      was very much bored in London, at least during the fore part of the day.
      He hailed Randal's entrance with a smile of relief, and rising and posting
      himself before the fire&mdash;a coat tail under each arm&mdash;he scarcely
      allowed Randal to shake hands with Mrs. Avenel, and pat the child on the
      head, murmuring, "Beautiful creature!" (Randal was ever civil to children,&mdash;that
      sort of wolf in sheep's clothing always is; don't be taken in, O you
      foolish young mothers!)&mdash;Dick, I say, scarcely allowed his visitor
      these preliminary courtesies, before he plunged far beyond depth of wife
      and child into the political ocean. "Things now were coming right,&mdash;a
      vile oligarchy was to be destroyed. British respectability and British
      talent were to have fair play." To have heard him you would have thought
      the day fixed for the millennium! "And what is more," said Avenel,
      bringing down the fist of his right hand upon the palm of his left, "if
      there is to be a new parliament, we must have new men; not worn-out old
      brooms that never sweep clean, but men who understand how to govern the
      country, Sir. I INTEND TO COME IN MYSELF!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mrs. Avenel, hooking in a word at last, "I am sure, Mr.
      Leslie, you will think I did right. I persuaded Mr. Avenel that, with his
      talents and property, he ought, for the sake of his country, to make a
      sacrifice; and then you know his opinions now are all the fashion, Mr.
      Leslie; formerly they would have been called shocking and vulgar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, she looked with fond pride at Dick's comely face, which at
      that moment, however, was all scowl and frown. I must do justice to Mrs.
      Avenel; she was a weak woman, silly in some things, and a cunning one in
      others, but she was a good wife as wives go. Scotch women generally are.
      "Bother!" said Dick. "What do women know about politics? I wish you'd mind
      the child,&mdash;it is crumpling up and playing almighty smash with that
      flim-flam book, which cost me one pound one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Avenel submissively bowed her head, and removed the Annual from the
      hands of the young destructive; the destructive set up a squall, as
      destructives usually do when they don't have their own way. Dick clapped
      his hand to his ears. "Whe-e-ew, I can't stand this; come and take a walk,
      Leslie: I want stretching!" He stretched himself as he spoke, first
      half-way up to the ceiling, and then fairly out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal, with his May Fair manner, turned towards Mrs. Avenel as if to
      apologize for her husband and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Richard!" said she, "he is in one of his humours,&mdash;all men have
      them. Come and see me again soon. When does Almack's open?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I ought to ask you that question,&mdash;you who know everything that
      goes on in our set," said the young serpent. Any tree planted in "our
      set," if it had been but a crab-tree, would have tempted Mr. Avenel's Eve
      to jump at its boughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you coming, there?" cried Dick, from the foot of the stairs.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I have just been at our friend Levy's," said Randal, when he and Dick
      were outside the street door. "He, like you, is full of politics; pleasant
      man,&mdash;for the business he is said to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Dick, slowly, "I suppose he is pleasant, but make the best of
      it&mdash;and still&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still what, my dear Avenel?" (Randal here for the first time discarded
      the formal Mister.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. AVENEL.&mdash;"Still the thing itself is not pleasant."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (with his soft hollow laugh).&mdash;"You mean borrowing money upon
      more than five per cent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, curse the percentage. I agree with Bentham on the Usury Laws,&mdash;no
      shackles in trade for me, whether in money or anything else. That's not
      it. But when one owes a fellow money even at two per cent, and 't is not
      convenient to pay him, why, somehow or other, it makes one feel small; it
      takes the British Liberty out of a man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have thought you more likely to lend money than to borrow it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I guess you are right there, as a general rule. But I tell you what
      it is, sir; there is too great a mania for competition getting up in this
      rotten old country of ours. I am as liberal as most men. I like
      competition to a certain extent, but there is too much of it, sir,&mdash;too
      much of it." Randal looked sad and convinced. But if Leonard had heard
      Dick Avenel, what would have been his amaze? Dick Avenel rail against
      competition! Think there could be too much of it! "Of course heaven and
      earth are coming together," said the spider, when the housemaid's broom
      invaded its cobweb. Dick was all for sweeping away other cobwebs; but he
      certainly thought heaven and earth coming together when he saw a great
      Turk's-head besom poked up at his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Avenel, in his genius for speculation and improvement, had established
      a factory at Screwstown, the first which had ever eclipsed the church
      spire with its Titanic chimney. It succeeded well at first. Mr. Avenel
      transferred to this speculation nearly all his capital. "Nothing," quoth
      he, "paid such an interest. Manchester was getting worn out,&mdash;time to
      show what Screwstown could do. Nothing like competition." But by-and-by a
      still greater capitalist than Dick Avenel, finding out that Screwstown was
      at the mouth of a coal mine, and that Dick's profits were great, erected a
      still uglier edifice, with a still taller chimney. And having been brought
      up to the business, and making his residence in the town, while Dick
      employed a foreman and flourished in London, this infamous competitor so
      managed, first to share, and then gradually to sequester, the profits
      which Dick had hitherto monopolized, that no wonder Mr. Avenel thought
      competition should have its limits. "The tongue touches where the tooth
      aches," as Dr. Riccabocca would tell us. By little and little our Juvenile
      Talleyrand (I beg the elder great man's pardon) wormed out from Dick this
      grievance, and in the grievance discovered the origin of Dick's connection
      with the money-lender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Levy," said Avenel, candidly, "is a decentish chap in his way,&mdash;friendly
      too. Mrs. A. finds him useful; brings some of your young highflyers to her
      soirees. To be sure, they don't dance,&mdash;stand all in a row at the
      door, like mutes at a funeral. Not but what they have been uncommon civil
      to me lately, Spendquick particularly. By-the-by, I dine with him
      to-morrow. The aristocracy are behindhand,&mdash;not smart, sir, not up to
      the march; but when a man knows how to take 'em, they beat the New Yorkers
      in good manners. I'll say that for them. I have no prejudice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw a man with less; no prejudice even against Levy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not a bit of it! Every one says he's a Jew; he says he's not. I don't
      care a button what he is. His money is English,&mdash;that's enough for
      any man of a liberal turn of mind. His charges, too, are moderate. To be
      sure, he knows I shall pay them; only what I don't like in him is a sort
      of way he has of mon-cher-ing and my-good-fellow-ing one, to do things
      quite out of the natural way of that sort of business. He knows I have got
      parliamentary influence. I could return a couple of members for
      Screwstown, and one, or perhaps two, for Lansmere, where I have of late
      been cooking up an interest; and he dictates to&mdash;no, not dictates&mdash;but
      tries to humbug me into putting in his own men. However, in one respect,
      we are likely to agree. He says you want to come into parliament. You seem
      a smart young fellow; but you must throw over that stiff red-tapist of
      yours, and go with Public Opinion, and&mdash;Myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind, Avenel; perhaps when we come to compare opinions we
      may find that we agree entirely. Still, in Egerton's present position,
      delicacy to him&mdash;However, we'll not discuss that now. But you really
      think I might come in for Lansmere,&mdash;against the L'Estrange interest,
      too, which must be strong there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was very strong, but I've smashed it, I calculate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would a contest there cost very much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I guess you must come down with the ready. But, as you say, time
      enough to discuss that when you have squared your account with 'delicacy;'
      come to me then, and we'll go into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal, having now squeezed his orange dry, had no desire to waste his
      time in brushing up the rind with his coat-sleeve, so he unhooked his arm
      from Avenel's, and, looking at his watch, discovered he should be just in
      time for an appointment of the most urgent business,&mdash;hailed a cab,
      and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick looked hipped and disconsolate at being left alone; he yawned very
      loud, to the astonishment of three prim old maiden Belgravians who were
      passing that way; and then his mind began to turn towards his factory at
      Screwstown, which had led to his connection with the baron; and he thought
      over a letter he had received from his foreman that morning, informing him
      that it was rumoured at Screwstown that Mr. Dyce, his rival, was about to
      have new machinery on an improved principle; and that Mr. Dyce had already
      gone up to town, it was supposed, with the intention of concluding a
      purchase for a patent discovery to be applied to the new machinery, and
      which that gentleman had publicly declared in the corn-market "would shut
      up Mr. Avenel's factory before the year was out." As this menacing epistle
      recurred to him, Dick felt his desire to yawn incontinently checked. His
      brow grew very dark; and he walked, with restless strides, on and on, till
      he found himself in the Strand. He then got into an omnibus, and proceeded
      to the city, wherein he spent the rest of the day looking over machines
      and foundries, and trying in vain to find out what diabolical invention
      the over-competition of Mr. Dyce had got hold of. "If," said Dick Avenel
      to himself, as he returned fretfully homeward&mdash;"if a man like me, who
      has done so much for British industry and go-a-head principles, is to be
      catawampously champed up by a mercenary, selfish cormorant of a capitalist
      like that interloping blockhead in drab breeches, Tom Dyce, all I can say
      is, that the sooner this cursed old country goes to the dogs, the better
      pleased I shall be. I wash my hands of it."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal's mind was made up. All he had learned in regard to Levy had
      confirmed his resolves or dissipated his scruples. He had started from the
      improbability that Pesehiera would offer, and the still greater
      improbability that Peschiera would pay him, L10,000 for such information
      or aid as he could bestow in furthering the count's object. But when Levy
      took such proposals entirely on himself, the main question to Randal
      became this,&mdash;could it be Levy's interest to make so considerable a
      sacrifice? Had the baron implied only friendly sentiments as his motives,
      Randal would have felt sure he was to be taken in; but the usurer's frank
      assurance that it would answer to him in the long-run to concede to Randal
      terms so advantageous, altered the case, and led our young philosopher to
      look at the affair with calm, contemplative eyes. Was it sufficiently
      obvious that Levy counted on an adequate return? Might he calculate on
      reaping help by the bushel if he sowed it by the handful? The result of
      Randal's cogitations was that the baron might fairly deem himself no
      wasteful sower. In the first place, it was clear that Levy, not without
      reasonable ground, believed that he could soon replace, with exceeding
      good interest, any sum he might advance to Randal, out of the wealth which
      Randal's prompt information might bestow on Levy's client, the count; and
      secondly, Randal's self-esteem was immense, and could he but succeed in
      securing a pecuniary independence on the instant, to free him from the
      slow drudgery of the Bar, or from a precarious reliance on Audley Egerton,
      as a politician out of power, his convictions of rapid triumph in public
      life were as strong as if whispered by an angel or promised by a fiend. On
      such triumphs, with all the social position they would secure, Levy might
      well calculate for repayment by a thousand indirect channels. Randal's
      sagacity detected that, through all the good-natured or liberal actions
      ascribed to the usurer, Levy had steadily pursued his own interests, he
      saw that Levy meant to get him into his power, and use his abilities as
      instruments for digging new mines, in which Baron Levy would claim the
      right of large royalties. But at that thought Randal's pale lip curled
      disdainfully; he confided too much in his own powers not to think that he
      could elude the grasp of the usurer, whenever it suited him to do so.
      Thus, on a survey, all conscience hushed itself; his mind rushed buoyantly
      on to anticipations of the future. He saw the hereditary estates regained,&mdash;no
      matter how mortgaged,&mdash;for the moment still his own, legally his own,
      yielding for the present what would suffice for competence to one of few
      wants, and freeing his name from that title of Adventurer, which is so
      prodigally given in rich old countries to those who have no estates but
      their brains. He thought of Violante but as the civilized trader thinks of
      a trifling coin, of a glass bead, which he exchanges with some barbarian
      for gold dust; he thought of Frank Hazeldean married to the foreign woman
      of beggared means, and repute that had known the breath of scandal,&mdash;married,
      and living on post-obit instalments of the Casino property; he thought of
      the poor squire's resentment; his avarice swept from the lands annexed to
      Rood on to the broad fields of Hazeldean; he thought of Avenel, of
      Lansmere, of parliament; with one hand he grasped fortune, with the next
      power. "And yet I entered on life with no patrimony (save a ruined hall
      and a barren waste),&mdash;no patrimony but knowledge. I have but turned
      knowledge from books to men; for books may give fame after death, but men
      give us power in life." And all the while he thus ruminated, his act was
      speeding his purpose. Though it was but in a miserable hack-cab that he
      erected airy scaffoldings round airy castles, still the miserable hack-cab
      was flying fast, to secure the first foot of solid ground whereon to
      transfer the mental plan of the architect to foundations of positive slime
      and clay. The cab stopped at the door of Lord Lansmere's house. Randal had
      suspected Violante to be there: he resolved to ascertain. Randal descended
      from his vehicle and rang the bell. The lodge-keeper opined the great
      wooden gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have called to see the young lady staying here,&mdash;the foreign young
      lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lansmere had been too confident of the security of her roof to
      condescend to give any orders to her servants with regard to her guest,
      and the lodge-keeper answered directly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "At home, I believe, sir. I rather think she is in the garden with my
      lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Randal; and he did see the form of Violante at a distance.
      "But, since she is walking, I will not disturb her at present. I will call
      another day."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lodge-keeper bowed respectfully, Randal jumped into his cab: "To
      Curzon Street,&mdash;quick!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harley had made one notable oversight in that appeal to Beatrice's better
      and gentler nature, which he entrusted to the advocacy of Leonard,&mdash;a
      scheme in itself very characteristic of Harley's romantic temper, and
      either wise or foolish, according as his indulgent theory of human
      idiosyncrasies in general, and of those peculiar to Beatrice di Negra in
      especial, was the dream of an enthusiast, or the inductive conclusion of a
      sound philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley had warned Leonard not to fall in love with the Italian,&mdash;he
      had forgotten to warn the Italian not to fall in love with Leonard; nor
      had he ever anticipated the probability of that event. This is not to be
      very much wondered at; for if there be anything on which the most sensible
      men are dull-eyed, where those eyes are not lighted by jealousy, it is as
      to the probabilities of another male creature being beloved. All, the
      least vain of the whiskered gender, think it prudent to guard themselves
      against being too irresistible to the fair sex; and each says of his
      friend, "Good fellow enough, but the last man for that woman to fall in
      love with!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But certainly there appeared on the surface more than ordinary cause for
      Harley's blindness in the special instance of Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Beatrice's better qualities, she was generally esteemed worldly
      and ambitious. She was pinched in circumstances, she was luxuriant and
      extravagant; how was it likely that she could distinguish any aspirant of
      the humble birth and fortunes of the young peasant-author? As a coquette,
      she might try to win his admiration and attract his fancy; but her own
      heart would surely be guarded in the triple mail of pride, poverty, and
      the conventional opinions of the world in which she lived. Had Harley
      thought it possible that Madame di Negra could stoop below her station,
      and love, not wisely, but too well, he would rather have thought that the
      object would be some brilliant adventurer of fashion, some one who could
      turn against herself all the arts of deliberate fascination, and all the
      experience bestowed by frequent conquest. One so simple as Leonard, so
      young and so new! Harley L'Estrange would have smiled at himself, if the
      idea of that image subjugating the ambitious woman to the disinterested
      love of a village maid had once crossed his mind. Nevertheless, so it was,
      and precisely from those causes which would have seemed to Harley to
      forbid the weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that fresh, pure heart, it was that simple, earnest sweetness, it
      was that contrast in look, in tone, in sentiment, and in reasonings, to
      all that had jaded and disgusted her in the circle of her admirers,&mdash;it
      was all this that captivated Beatrice at the first interview with Leonard.
      Here was what she had confessed to the sceptical Randal she had dreamed
      and sighed for. Her earliest youth had passed into abhorrent marriage,
      without the soft, innocent crisis of human life,&mdash;virgin love. Many a
      wooer might have touched her vanity, pleased her fancy, excited her
      ambition&mdash;her heart had never been awakened; it woke now. The world,
      and the years that the world had wasted, seemed to fleet away as a cloud.
      She was as if restored to the blush and the sigh of youth,&mdash;the youth
      of the Italian maid. As in the restoration of our golden age is the spell
      of poetry with us all, so such was the spell of the poet himself on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how exquisite was that brief episode in the life of the woman palled
      with the "hack sights and sounds" of worldly life! How strangely happy
      were those hours, when, lured on by her silent sympathy, the young scholar
      spoke of his early struggles between circumstance and impulse, musing
      amidst the flowers, and hearkening to the fountain; or of his wanderings
      in the desolate, lamp-lit streets, while the vision of Chatterton's
      glittering eyes shone dread through the friendless shadows. And as he
      spoke, whether of his hopes or his fears, her looks dwelt fondly on the
      young face, that varied between pride and sadness,&mdash;pride ever so
      gentle, and sad ness ever so nobly touching. She was never weary of gazing
      on that brow, with its quiet power; but her lids dropped before those
      eyes, with their serene, unfathomable passion. She felt, as they haunted
      her, what a deep and holy thing love in such souls must be. Leonard never
      spoke to her of Helen&mdash;that reserve every reader can comprehend. To
      natures like his, first love is a mystery; to confide it is to profane.
      But he fulfilled his commission of interesting her in the exile and his
      daughter, and his description of them brought tears to her eyes. She inly
      resolved not to aid Peschiera in his designs on Violante. She forgot for
      the moment that her own fortune was to depend on the success of those
      designs. Levy had arranged so that she was not reminded of her poverty by
      creditors,&mdash;she knew not how. She knew nothing of business. She gave
      herself up to the delight of the present hour, and to vague prospects of a
      future associated with that young image,&mdash;with that face of a
      guardian angel that she saw before her, fairest in the moments of absence;
      for in those moments came the life of fairy-land, when we shut our eyes on
      the world, and see through the haze of golden revery. Dangerous, indeed,
      to Leonard would have been the soft society of Beatrice di Negra, had not
      his heart been wholly devoted to one object, and had not his ideal of
      woman been from that object one sole and indivisible reflection. But
      Beatrice guessed not this barrier between herself and him. Amidst the
      shadows that he conjured up from his past life, she beheld no rival form.
      She saw him lonely in the world, as she was herself. And in his lowly
      birth, his youth, in the freedom from presumption which characterized him
      in all things (save that confidence in his intellectual destinies which is
      the essential attribute of genius), she but grew the bolder by the belief
      that, even if he loved her, he would not dare to hazard the avowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, one day, yielding, as she had ever been wont to yield, to the
      impulse of her quick Italian heart&mdash;how she never remembered, in what
      words she could never recall&mdash;she spoke, she owned her love, she
      pleaded, with tears and blushes, for love in return. All that passed was
      to her as a dream,&mdash;a dream from which she woke with a fierce sense
      of agony, of humiliation,&mdash;woke as the woman "scorned." No matter how
      gratefully, how tenderly Leonard had replied, the reply was refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time she learned she had a rival; that all he could give of
      love was long since, from his boyhood, given to another. For the first
      time in her life, that ardent nature knew jealousy, its torturing stings,
      its thirst for vengeance, its tempest of loving hate. But, to outward
      appearance, silent and cold she stood as marble. Words that sought to
      soothe fell on her ear unheeded: they were drowned by the storm within.
      Pride was the first feeling which dominated the warring elements that
      raged in her soul. She tore her hand from that which clasped hers with so
      loyal a respect. She could have spurned the form that knelt at her feet,
      not for love, but for pardon. She pointed to the door with the gesture of
      an insulted queen. She knew no more till she was alone. Then came that
      rapid flash of conjecture peculiar to the storms of jealousy; that which
      seems to single from all nature the one object to dread and to destroy;
      the conjecture so often false, yet received at once by our convictions as
      the revelation of instinctive truth. He to whom she had humbled herself
      loved another; whom but Violante,&mdash;whom else, young and beautiful,
      had he named in the record of his life?&mdash;None! And he had sought to
      interest her, Beatrice di Negra, in the object of his love; hinted at
      dangers which Beatrice knew too well; implied trust in Beatrice's will to
      protect. Blind fool that she had been! This, then, was the reason why he
      had come, day after day, to Beatrice's house; this was the charm that had
      drawn him thither; this&mdash;she pressed her hands to her burning
      temples, as if to stop the torture of thought. Suddenly a voice was heard
      below, the door opened, and Randal Leslie entered.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Punctually at eight o'clock that evening, Baron Levy welcomed the new ally
      he had secured. The pair dined en tete a tete, discussing general matters
      till the servants left them to their wine. Then said the baron, rising and
      stirring the fire&mdash;then said the baron, briefly and significantly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As regards the property you spoke of," answered Randal, "I am willing to
      purchase it on the terms you name. The only point that perplexes me is how
      to account to Audley Egerton, to my parents, to the world, for the power
      of purchasing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said the baron, without even a smile at the ingenious and truly
      Greek manner in which Randal had contrived to denote his meaning, and
      conceal the ugliness of it&mdash;"true, we must think of that. If we could
      manage to conceal the real name of the purchaser for a year or so, it
      might be easy,&mdash;you may be supposed to have speculated in the Funds;
      or Egerton may die, and people may believe that he had secured to you
      something handsome from the ruins of his fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little chance of Egerton's dying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said the baron. "However, this is a mere detail, reserved for
      consideration. You can now tell us where the young lady is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. I could not this morning,&mdash;I can now. I will go with you
      to the count. Meanwhile, I have seen Madame di Negra; she will accept
      Frank Hazeldean if he will but offer himself at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will he not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I have been to him. He is overjoyed at my representations, but
      considers it his duty to ask the consent of his parents. Of course they
      will not give it; and if there be delay, she will retract. She is under
      the influence of passions on the duration of which there is no reliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What passions? Love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love; but not for Hazeldean. The passions that bring her to accept his
      hand are pique and jealousy. She believes, in a word, that one who seems
      to have gained the mastery over her affections with a strange suddenness,
      is but blind to her charms because dazzled by Violante's. She is prepared
      to aid in all that can give her rival to Peschiera; and yet, such is the
      inconsistency of woman" (added the young philosopher, with a shrug of the
      shoulders), "that she is also prepared to lose all chance of securing him
      she loves, by bestowing herself on another!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman, indeed, all over!" said the baron, tapping his snuff-box (Louis
      Quinze), and regaling his nostrils with a scornful pinch. "But who is the
      man whom the fair Beatrice has thus honoured? Superb creature! I had some
      idea of her myself when I bought up her debts; but it might have
      embarrassed me, in more general plans, as regards the count. All for the
      best. Who's the man? Not Lord L'Estrange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think it is he; but I have not yet ascertained. I have told you
      all I know. I found her in a state so excited, so unlike herself, that I
      had no little difficulty in soothing her into confidence so far. I could
      not venture more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she will accept Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had he offered to-day she would have accepted him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be a great help to your fortunes, mon cher, if Frank Hazeldean
      marry this lady without his father's consent. Perhaps he may be
      disinherited. You are next of kin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that?" asked Randal, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my business to know all about the chances and connections of any
      one with whom I do money matters. I do money matters with young Mr.
      Hazeldean; so I know that the Hazeldean property is not entailed; and, as
      the squire's half-brother has no Hazeldean blood in him, you have
      excellent expectations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Frank tell you I was next of kin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rather think so; but I am sure you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;when?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you told me how important it was to you that Frank should marry
      Madame di Negra. Peste! mon cher, do you think I am a blockhead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Baron, Frank is of age, and can marry to please himself. You
      implied to me that you could help him in this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try. See that he call at Madame di Negra's tomorrow, at two
      precisely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather keep clear of all apparent interference in this matter.
      Will you not arrange that he call on her? And do not forget to entangle
      him in a post-obit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave it to me. Any more wine? No?&mdash;then let us go to the count's."

    <p>
      The next morning Frank Hazeldean was sitting over his solitary
      breakfast-table. It was long past noon. The young man had risen early, it
      is true, to attend his military duties, but he had contracted the habit of
      breakfasting late. One's appetite does not come early when one lives in
      London, and never goes to bed before daybreak.

    <p>
      There was nothing very luxurious or effeminate about Frank's rooms, though
      they were in a very dear street, and he paid a monstrous high price for
      them. Still, to a practised eye, they betrayed an inmate who can get
      through his money, and make very little show for it. The walls were
      covered with coloured prints of racers and steeple-chases, interspersed
      with the portraits of opera-dancers, all smirk and caper. Then there was a
      semi-circular recess covered with red cloth, and fitted up for smoking, as
      you might perceive by sundry stands full of Turkish pipes in cherry-stick
      and jessamine, with amber mouthpieces; while a great serpent hookah, from
      which Frank could no more have smoked than he could have smoked out of the
      head of a boa constrictor, coiled itself up on the floor; over the
      chimney-piece was a collection of Moorish arms. What use on earth ataghan
      and scimitar and damasquined pistols, that would not carry straight three
      yards, could be to an officer in his Majesty's Guards is more than I can
      conjecture, or even Frank satisfactorily explain. I have strong suspicions
      that this valuable arsenal passed to Frank in part payment of a bill to be
      discounted. At all events, if so, it was an improvement on the bear that
      he had sold to the hair-dresser. No books were to be seen anywhere, except
      a Court Guide, a Racing Calendar, an Army List, the Sporting Magazine
      complete (whole bound in scarlet morocco, at about a guinea per volume),
      and a small book, as small as an Elzevir, on the chimney-piece, by the
      side of a cigar-case. That small book had cost Frank more than all the
      rest put together; it was his Own Book, his book par excellence; book made
      up by himself,&mdash;his BETTING Book!
    </p>
    <p>
      On a centre table were deposited Frank's well-brushed hat; a satinwood
      box, containing kid-gloves, of various delicate tints, from primrose to
      lilac; a tray full of cards and three-cornered notes; an opera-glass, and
      an ivory subscription-ticket to his opera stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one corner was an ingenious receptacle for canes, sticks, and whips&mdash;I
      should not like, in these bad times, to have paid the bill for them; and
      mounting guard by that receptacle, stood a pair of boots as bright as
      Baron Levy's,&mdash;"the force of brightness could no further go." Frank
      was in his dressing-gown,&mdash;very good taste, quite Oriental,
      guaranteed to be true Indian cashmere, and charged as such. Nothing could
      be more neat, though perfectly simple, than the appurtenances of his
      breakfast-table: silver tea-pot, ewer, and basin, all fitting into his
      dressing-box&mdash;for the which may Storr and Mortimer be now praised,
      and some day paid! Frank looked very handsome, rather tired, and
      exceedingly bored. He had been trying to read the "Morning Post," but the
      effort had proved too much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor dear Frank Hazeldean!&mdash;true type of many a poor dear fellow who
      has long since gone to the dogs. And if, in this road to ruin, there had
      been the least thing to do the traveller any credit by the way! One feels
      a respect for the ruin of a man like Audley Egerton. He is ruined en roi!
      From the wrecks of his fortune he can look down and see stately monuments
      built from the stones of that dismantled edifice. In every institution
      which attests the humanity of England was a record of the princely bounty
      of the public man. In those objects of party, for which the proverbial
      sinews of war are necessary, in those rewards for service, which private
      liberality can confer, the hand of Egerton had been opened as with the
      heart of a king. Many a rising member of parliament, in those days when
      talent was brought forward through the aid of wealth and rank, owed his
      career to the seat which Audley Egerton's large subscription had secured
      to him; many an obscure supporter in letters and the Press looked back to
      the day when he had been freed from the jail by the gratitude of the
      patron. The city he represented was embellished at his cost; through the
      shire that held his mortgaged lands, which he had rarely ever visited, his
      gold had flowed as a Pactolus; all that could animate its public spirit,
      or increase its civilization, claimed kindred with his munificence, and
      never had a claim disallowed. Even in his grand, careless household, with
      its large retinue and superb hospitality, there was something worthy of a
      representative of that time-honoured portion of our true nobility, the
      untitled gentlemen of the land. The Great Commoner had, indeed, "something
      to show" for the money he had disdained and squandered. But for Frank
      Hazeldean's mode of getting rid of the dross, when gone, what would be
      left to tell the tale? Paltry prints in a bachelor's lodging; a collection
      of canes and cherry-sticks; half-a-dozen letters in ill-spelt French from
      a figurante; some long-legged horses, fit for nothing but to lose a race;
      that damnable Betting-Book; and&mdash;sic transit gloria&mdash;down sweeps
      some hawk of a Levy, on the wings of an I O U, and not a feather is left
      of the pigeon!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Frank Hazeldean has stuff in him,&mdash;a good heart, and strict
      honour. Fool though he seem, there is sound sterling sense in some odd
      corner of his brains, if one could but get at it. All he wants to save him
      from perdition is, to do what he has never yet done,&mdash;namely, pause
      and think. But, to be sure, that same operation of thinking is not so easy
      for folks unaccustomed to it, as people who think&mdash;think!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't bear this," said Frank, suddenly, and springing to his feet.
      "This woman, I cannot get her out of my head. I ought to go down to the
      governor's; but then if he gets into a passion, and refuses his consent,
      where am I? And he will, too, I fear. I wish I could make out what Randal
      advises. He seems to recommend that I should marry Beatrice at once, and
      trust to my mother's influence to make all right afterwards. But when I
      ask, 'Is that your advice?' he backs out of it. Well, I suppose he is
      right there. I can understand that he is unwilling, good fellow, to
      recommend anything that my father would disapprove. But still&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Frank stopped in his soliloquy, and did make his first desperate
      effort to&mdash;think!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, O dear reader, I assume, of course, that thou art one of the class to
      which thought is familiar; and, perhaps, thou hast smiled in disdain or
      incredulity at that remark on the difficulty of thinking which preceded
      Frank Hazeldean's discourse to himself. But art thou quite sure that when
      thou hast tried to think thou hast always succeeded? Hast thou not often
      been duped by that pale visionary simulacrum of thought which goes by the
      name of revery? Honest old Montaigne confessed that he did not understand
      that process of sitting down to think, on which some folks express
      themselves so glibly. He could not think unless he had a pen in his hand
      and a sheet of paper before him; and so, by a manual operation, seized and
      connected the links of ratiocination. Very often has it happened to myself
      when I have said to Thought peremptorily, "Bestir thyself: a serious
      matter is before thee, ponder it well, think of it," that that same
      thought has behaved in the most refractory, rebellious manner conceivable;
      and instead of concentrating its rays into a single stream of light, has
      broken into all the desultory tints of the rainbow, colouring senseless
      clouds, and running off into the seventh heaven, so that after sitting a
      good hour by the clock, with brows as knit as if I was intent on squaring
      the circle, I have suddenly discovered that I might as well have gone
      comfortably to sleep&mdash;I have been doing nothing but dream,&mdash;and
      the most nonsensical dreams! So when Frank Hazeldean, as he stopped at
      that meditative "But still "&mdash;and leaning his arm on the
      chimney-piece, and resting his face on his hand, felt himself at the grave
      crisis of life, and fancied he was going "to think on it," there only rose
      before him a succession of shadowy pictures,&mdash;Randal Leslie, with an
      unsatisfactory countenance, from which he could extract nothing; the
      squire, looking as black as thunder in his study at Hazeldean; his mother
      trying to plead for him, and getting herself properly scolded for her
      pains; and then off went that Will-o'-the-wisp which pretended to call
      itself Thought, and began playing round the pale, charming face of
      Beatrice di Negra, in the drawing-room at Curzon Street, and repeating,
      with small elfin voice, Randal Leslie's assurance of the preceding day,
      "as to her affection for you, Frank, there is no doubt of that; she only
      begins to think you are trifling with her." And then there was a rapturous
      vision of a young gentleman on his knee, and the fair pale face bathed in
      blushes, and a clergyman standing by the altar, and a carriage-and-four
      with white favours at the church-door; and of a honeymoon, which would
      have astonished as to honey all the bees of Hymettus. And in the midst of
      these phantasmagoria, which composed what Frank fondly styled, "making up
      his mind," there came a single man's elegant rat-tat-tat at the street
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One never has a moment for thinking," cried Frank, and he called out to
      his valet, "Not at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was too late. Lord Spendquick was in the hall, and presently within
      the room. How d'ye do's were exchanged and hands shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD SPENDQUICK.&mdash;"I have a note for you, Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (lazily).&mdash;"From whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD SPENDQUICK.&mdash;"Levy. Just come from him,&mdash;never saw him in
      such a fidget. He was going into the city,&mdash;I suppose to see X. Y.
      Dashed off this note for you, and would have sent it by a servant, but I
      said I would bring it."
    </p>
    <p>
      FRANK (looking fearfully at the note).&mdash;"I hope he does not want his
      money yet. 'Private and confidential,'&mdash;that looks bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      SPENDQUICK.&mdash;"Devilish bad, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank opens the note, and reads, half aloud, "Dear Hazeldean&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      SPENDQUICK (interrupting.)&mdash;"Good sign! He always Spendquicks me when
      he lends me money; and 't is 'My dear Lord' when he wants it back. Capital
      sign!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank reads on, but to himself, and with a changing countenance,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   DEAR HAZELDEAN,&mdash;I am very sorry to tell you that, in consequence of
   the sudden failure of a house at Paris with which I Had large
   dealings, I am pressed on a sudden for all the ready money I can
   get. I don't want to inconvenience you, but do try to see if you
   can take up those bills of yours which I hold, and which, as you
   know, have been due some little time. I had hit on a way of
   arranging your affairs; but when I hinted at it, you seemed to
   dislike the idea; and Leslie has since told me that you have strong
   objections to giving any security on your prospective property. So
   no more of that, my dear fellow. I am called out in haste to try
   what I can do for a very charming client of mine, who is in great
   pecuniary distress, though she has for her brother a foreign count,
   as rich as a Croesus. There is an execution in her house. I am
   going down to the tradesman who put it in, but have no hope of
   softening him; and I fear there will be others before the day is
   out. Another reason for wanting money, if you can help me, mon
   cher! An execution in the house of one of the most brilliant women
   in London,&mdash;an execution in Curzon Street, May Fair! It will be all
   over the town if I can't stop it.

   Yours in haste,
               LEVY.

   P.S.&mdash;Don't let what I have said vex you too much. I should not
   trouble you if Spendquick and Borrowell would pay me something.
   Perhaps you can get them to do so.
</pre>
    <p>
      Struck by Frank's silence and paleness, Lord Spendquick here, in the
      kindest way possible, laid his hand on the young Guardsman's shoulder. and
      looked over the note with that freedom which gentlemen in difficulties
      take with each other's private and confidential correspondence. His eye
      fell on the postscript. "Oh, damn it," cried Spendquick, "but that's too
      bad,&mdash;employing you to get me to pay him! Such horrid treachery. Make
      yourself easy, my dear Frank; I could never suspect you of anything so
      unhandsome. I could as soon suspect myself of&mdash;paying him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curzon Street! Count!" muttered Frank, as if waking from a dream. "It
      must be so." To thrust on his boots, change his dressing-robe for a
      frock-coat, snatch at his hat, gloves, and cane, break from Spendquick,
      descend the stairs, a flight at a leap, gain the street, throw himself
      into a cabriolet,&mdash;all this was done before his astounded visitor
      could even recover breath enough to ask "What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Left thus alone, Lord Spendquick shook his head,&mdash;shook it twice, as
      if fully to convince himself that there was nothing in it; and then
      re-arranging his hat before the looking-glass, and drawing on his gloves
      deliberately, he walked downstairs, and strolled into White's, but with a
      bewildered and absent air. Standing at the celebrated bow-window for some
      moments in musing silence, Lord Spendquick at last thus addressed an
      exceedingly cynical, sceptical old roue,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, do you think there is any truth in the stories about people in
      former times selling themselves to the devil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ugh," answered the rout, much too wise ever to be surprised. "Have you
      any personal interest in the question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!&mdash;no; but a friend of mine has just received a letter from Levy,
      and he flew out of the room in the most ex-tra-ordi-na-ry manner,&mdash;just
      as people did in those days when their time was up! And Levy, you know, is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite as great a fool as the other dark gentleman to whom you would
      compare him; for Levy never made such bad bargains for himself. Time up!
      No doubt it is. I should not like to be in your friend's shoes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoes!" said Spendquick, with a sort of shudder; "you never saw a neater
      fellow, nor one, to do him justice, who takes more time in dressing than
      he does in general. And talking of shoes, he rushed out with the right
      boot on the left foot, and the left boot on the right. Very mysterious!"
      And a third time Lord Spendquick shook his head,&mdash;and a third time
      that head seemed to him wondrous empty.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Buy Frank had arrived in Curzon Street, leaped from the cabriolet, knocked
      at the door, which was opened by a strange-looking man in a buff waistcoat
      and corduroy smalls. Frank gave a glance at this personage, pushed him
      aside, and rushed upstairs. He burst into the drawing-room,&mdash;no
      Beatrice was there. A thin elderly man, with a manuscript book in his
      hands, appeared engaged in examining the furniture, and making an
      inventory, with the aid of Madame di Negra's upper servant. The thin man
      stared at Frank, and touched the hat which was on his head. The servant,
      who was a foreigner, approached Frank, and said, in broken English, that
      his lady did not receive,&mdash;that she was unwell, and kept her room.
      Frank thrust a sovereign into the servant's hand, and begged him to tell
      Madame di Negra. that Mr. Hazeldean entreated the honour of an interview.
      As soon as the servant vanished on this errand, Frank seized the thin man
      by the arm. "What is this?&mdash;an execution?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what sum?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifteen hundred and forty-seven pounds. We are the first in possession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are others, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or else, sir, we should never have taken this step. Most painful to our
      feelings, sir; but these foreigners are here to day, and gone to-morrow.
      And&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant re-entered. Madame di Negra would see Mr. Hazeldean. Would he
      walk upstairs? Frank hastened to obey this summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame di Negra was in a small room which was fitted up as a boudoir. Her
      eyes showed the traces of recent tears, but her face was composed, and
      even rigid, in its haughty though mournful expression. Frank, however, did
      not pause to notice her countenance, to hear her dignified salutation. All
      his timidity was gone. He saw but the woman whom he loved in distress and
      humiliation. As the door closed on him, he flung himself at her feet. He
      caught at her hand, the skirt of her robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Madame di Negra!&mdash;Beatrice!" he exclaimed, tears in his eyes,
      and his voice half-broken by generous emotion; "forgive me, forgive me!
      don't see in me a mere acquaintance. By accident I learned, or, rather,
      guessed&mdash;this&mdash;this strange insult to which you are so
      unworthily exposed. I am here. Think of me&mdash;but as a friend,&mdash;the
      truest friend. Oh, Beatrice,"&mdash;and he bent his head over the hand he
      held,&mdash;"I never dared say so before, it seems presuming to say it
      now, but I cannot help it. I love you,&mdash;I love you with my whole
      heart and soul; to serve you&mdash;if only but to serve you!&mdash;I ask
      nothing else." And a sob went from his warm, young, foolish heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian was deeply moved. Nor was her nature that of the mere sordid
      adventuress. So much love and so much confidence! She was not prepared to
      betray the one, and entrap the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rise, rise," she said softly; "I thank you gratefully. But do not suppose
      that I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! hush!&mdash;you must not refuse me. Hush! don't let your pride
      speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is not my pride. You exaggerate what is occurring here. You forget
      that I have a brother. I have sent for him. He is the only one I can apply
      to. Ah, that is his knock! But I shall never, never forget that I have
      found one generous noble heart in this hollow world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank would have replied, but he heard the count's voice on the stairs,
      and had only time to rise and withdraw to the window, trying hard to
      repress his agitation and compose his countenance. Count di Peschiera
      entered,&mdash;entered as a very personation of the beauty and
      magnificence of careless, luxurious, pampered, egotistical wealth,&mdash;his
      surtout, trimmed with the costliest sables, flung back from his splendid
      chest. Amidst the folds of the glossy satin that enveloped his throat
      gleamed a turquoise, of such value as a jeweller might have kept for fifty
      years before he could find a customer rich and frivolous enough to buy it.
      The very head of his cane was a masterpiece of art, and the man himself,
      so elegant despite his strength, and so fresh despite his years!&mdash;it
      is astonishing how well men wear when they think of no one but themselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pr-rr!" said the count, not observing Frank behind the draperies of the
      window; "Pr-rr&mdash;It seems to me that you must have passed a very
      unpleasant quarter of an hour. And now&mdash;Dieu me damne, quoi faire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice pointed to the window, and felt as if she could have sunk into
      the earth for shame. But as the count spoke in French, and Frank did not
      very readily comprehend that language, the words escaped him, though his
      ear was shocked by a certain satirical levity of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank came forward. The count held out his hand, and with a rapid change
      of voice and manner, said, "One whom my sister admits at such a moment
      must be a friend to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hazeldean," said Beatrice, with meaning, "would indeed have nobly
      pressed on me the offer of an aid which I need no more, since you, my
      brother, are here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said the count, with his superb air of grand seigneur; "I
      will go down and clear your house of this impertinent canaille. But I
      thought your affairs were with Baron Levy. He should be here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect him every moment. Adieu! Mr. Hazeldean." Beatrice extended her
      hand to her young lover with a frankness which was not without a certain
      pathetic and cordial dignity. Restrained from further words by the count's
      presence, Frank bowed over the fair hand in silence, and retired. He was
      on the stairs when he was joined by Peschiera.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hazeldean," said the latter, in a low tone, "will you come into the
      drawing-room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank obeyed. The man employed in his examination of the furniture was
      still at his task: but at a short whisper from the count he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir," said Peschiera, "I am so unacquainted with your English
      laws, and your mode of settling embarrassments of this degrading nature,
      and you have evidently showed so kind a sympathy in my sister's distress,
      that I venture to ask you to stay here, and aid me in consulting with
      Baron Levy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank was just expressing his unfeigned pleasure to be of the slightest
      use, when Levy's knock resounded at the streetdoor, and in another moment
      the baron entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ouf!" said Levy, wiping his brows, and sinking into a chair as if he had
      been engaged in toils the most exhausting,&mdash;"ouf! this is a very sad
      business,&mdash;very; and nothing, my dear count, nothing but ready money
      can save us here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know my affairs, Levy," replied Peschiera, mournfully shaking his
      head, "and that though in a few months, or it may be weeks, I could
      discharge with ease my sister's debts, whatever their amount, yet at this
      moment, and in a strange land, I have not the power to do so. The money I
      brought with me is nearly exhausted. Can you not advance the requisite
      sum?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!&mdash;Mr. Hazeldean is aware of the distress under which I
      labour myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," said the count, "all we can do to-day is to remove my
      sister, and let the execution proceed. Meanwhile I will go among my
      friends, and see what I can borrow from them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said Levy, rising and looking out of the window&mdash;"alas!&mdash;we
      cannot remove the marchesa,&mdash;the worst is to come. Look!&mdash;you
      see those three men; they have a writ against her person: the moment she
      sets her foot out of these doors she will be arrested."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [At that date the law of mesne process existed still.]
</pre>
    <p>
      "Arrested!" exclaimed Peschiera and Frank in a breath. "I have done my
      best to prevent this disgrace, but in vain," said the baron, looking very
      wretched. "You see these English tradespeople fancy they have no hold upon
      foreigners. But we can get bail; she must not go to prison&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prison!" echoed Frank. He hastened to Levy and drew him aside. The count
      seemed paralyzed by shame and grief. Throwing himself back on the sofa, he
      covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sister!" groaned the count&mdash;"daughter to a Peschiera, widow to a
      Di Negra!" There was something affecting in the proud woe of this grand
      patrician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the sum?" whispered Frank, anxious that the poor count should not
      overhear him; and indeed the count seemed too stunned and overwhelmed to
      hear anything less loud than a clap of thunder!
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may settle all liabilities for L5,000. Nothing to Peschiera, who is
      enormously rich. Entre nous, I doubt his assurance that he is without
      ready money. It may be so, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five thousand pounds! How can I raise such a sum?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, my dear Hazeldean? What are you talking about? To be sure you could
      raise twice as much with a stroke of your pen, and throw your own debts
      into the bargain. But&mdash;to be so generous to an acquaintance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Acquaintance!&mdash;Madame di Negra! the height of my ambition is to
      claim her as my wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And these debts don't startle you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If a man loves," answered Frank, simply, "he feels it most when the woman
      he loves is in affliction. And," he added, after a pause, "though these
      debts are faults, kindness at this moment may give me the power to cure
      forever both her faults and my own. I can raise this money by a stroke of
      the pen! How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the Casino property."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No other way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. But I know your scruples; let us see if they can be
      conciliated. You would marry Madame di Negra; she will have L20,000 on her
      wedding-day. Why not arrange that, out of this sum, your anticipative
      charge on the Casino property be paid at once? Thus, in truth, it will be
      but for a few weeks that the charge will exist. The bond will remain
      locked in my desk; it can never come to your father's know ledge, nor
      wound his feelings. And when you marry (if you will but be prudent in the
      mean while), you will not owe a debt in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the count suddenly started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hazeldean, I asked you to stay and aid us by your counsel; I see now
      that counsel is unavailing. This blow on our House must fall! I thank you,
      Sir,&mdash;I thank you. Farewell. Levy, come with me to my poor sister,
      and prepare her for the worst."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count," said Frank, "hear me. My acquaintance with you is but slight, but
      I have long known and&mdash;and esteemed your sister. Baron Levy has
      suggested a mode in which I can have the honour and the happiness of
      removing this temporary but painful embarrassment. I can advance the
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" exclaimed Peschiera. "How can you suppose that I will hear of
      such a proposition? Your youth and benevolence mislead and blind you.
      Impossible, sir,&mdash;impossible! Why, even if I had no pride, no
      delicacy of my own, my sister's fair fame&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would suffer indeed," interrupted Levy, "if she were under such
      obligation to any one but her affianced husband. Nor, whatever my regard
      for you, Count, could I suffer my client, Mr. Hazeldean, to make this
      advance upon any less valid security than that of the fortune to which
      Madame di Negra is entitled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!&mdash;is this indeed so? You are a suitor for my sister's hand, Mr.
      Hazeldean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not at this moment,&mdash;not to owe her hand to the compulsion of
      gratitude," answered gentleman Frank. "Gratitude! And you do not know her
      heart, then? Do not know&mdash;" the count interrupted himself, and went
      on after a pause. "Mr. Hazeldean, I need not say that we rank among the
      first Houses in Europe. My pride led me formerly into the error of
      disposing of my sister's hand to one whom she did not love, merely because
      in rank he was her equal. I will not again commit such an error, nor would
      Beatrice again obey me if I sought to constrain her. Where she marries,
      there she will love. If, indeed, she accepts you, as I believe she will,
      it will be from affection solely. If she does, I cannot scruple to accept
      this loan,&mdash;a loan from a brother-inlaw&mdash;loan to me, and not
      charged against her fortune! That, sir," turning to Levy, with his grand
      air, "you will take care to arrange. If she do not accept you, Mr.
      Hazeldean, the loan, I repeat, is not to be thought of. Pardon me, if I
      leave you. This, one way or other, must be decided at once." The count
      inclined his head with much stateliness, and then quitted the room. His
      step was heard ascending the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If," said Levy, in the tone of a mere man of business&mdash;"if the count
      pay the debts, and the lady's fortune be only charged with your own, after
      all, it will not be a bad marriage in the world's eye, nor ought it to be
      in a father's. Trust me, we shall get Mr. Hazeldean's consent, and
      cheerfully too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank did not listen; he could only listen to his love, to his heart
      beating loud with hope and with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy sat down before the table, and drew up a long list of figures in a
      very neat hand,&mdash;a list of figures on two accounts, which the
      post-obit on the Casino was destined to efface.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a lapse of time, which to Frank seemed interminable, the count
      re-appeared. He took Frank aside, with a gesture to Levy, who rose, and
      retired into the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear young friend," said Peschiera, "as I suspected, my sister's heart
      is wholly yours. Stop; hear me out. But, unluckily, I informed her of your
      generous proposal; it was most unguarded, most ill-judged in me, and that
      has well-nigh spoiled all; she has so much pride and spirit; so great a
      fear that you may think yourself betrayed into an imprudence which you may
      hereafter regret, that I am sure she will tell you that she does not love
      you, she cannot accept you, and so forth. Lovers like you are not easily
      deceived. Don't go by her words; but you shall see her yourself and judge.
      Come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed mechanically by Frank, the count ascended the stairs, and threw
      open the door of Beatrice's room. The marchesa's back was turned; but
      Frank could see that she was weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have brought my friend to plead for himself," said the count, in
      French; "and take my advice, sister, and do not throw away all prospect of
      real and solid happiness for a vain scruple. Heed me!" He retired, and
      left Frank alone with Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the marchesa, as if by a violent effort, so sudden was her movement,
      and so wild her look, turned her face to her wooer, and came up to him,
      where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she said, clasping her hands, "is this true? You would save me from
      disgrace, from a prison&mdash;and what can I give you in return? My love!
      No, no. I will not deceive you. Young, fair, noble as you are, I do not
      love you as you should be loved. Go; leave this house; you do not know my
      brother. Go, go&mdash;while I have still strength, still virtue enough to
      reject whatever may protect me from him! whatever&mdash;may&mdash;Oh, go,
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not love me?" said Frank. "Well, I don't wonder at it; you are so
      brilliant, so superior to me. I will abandon hope,&mdash;I will leave you,
      as you command me. But at least I will not part with my privilege to serve
      you. As for the rest, shame on me if I could be mean enough to boast of
      love, and enforce a suit, at such a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank turned his face and stole away softly. He did not arrest his steps
      at the drawing-room; he went into the parlour, wrote a brief line to Levy
      charging him quietly to dismiss the execution, and to come to Frank's
      rooms with the necessary deeds; and, above all, to say nothing to the
      count. Then he went out of the house and walked back to his lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Levy came to him, and accounts were gone into, and papers
      signed; and the next morning Madame di Negra was free from debt; and there
      was a great claim on the reversion of the Casino estates; and at the noon
      of that next day, Randal was closeted with Beatrice; and before the night
      came a note from Madame di Negra, hurried, blurred with tears, summoning
      Frank to Curzon Street. And when he entered the marchesa's drawing-room,
      Peschiera was seated beside his sister; and rising at Frank's entrance,
      said, "My dear brother-in-law!" and placed Frank's hand in Beatrice's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You accept&mdash;you accept me&mdash;and of your own free will and
      choice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Beatrice answered, "Bear with me a little, and I will try to repay you
      with all my&mdash;all my&mdash;" She stopped short, and sobbed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never thought her capable of such acute feelings, such strong
      attachment," whispered the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank heard, and his face was radiant. By degrees Madame di Negra
      recovered composure, and she listened with what her young lover deemed a
      tender interest, but what, in fact, was mournful and humbled resignation,
      to his joyous talk of the future. To him the hours passed by, brief and
      bright, like a flash of sunlight. And his dreams when he retired to rest
      were so golden! But when he awoke the next morning, he said to himself,
      "What&mdash;what will they say at the Hall?" At that same hour Beatrice,
      burying her face on her pillow, turned from the loathsome day, and could
      have prayed for death. At that same hour, Giulio Franzini, Count di
      Peschiera, dismissing some gaunt, haggard Italians, with whom he had been
      in close conference, sallied forth to reconnoitre the house that contained
      Violante. At that same hour, Baron Levy was seated before his desk,
      casting up a deadly array of figures, headed, "Account with the Right Hon.
      Audley Egerton, M. P., Dr. and Cr."&mdash;title-deeds strewed around him,
      and Frank Hazeldean's post-obit peeping out fresh from the elder
      parchments. At that same hour, Audley Egerton had just concluded a letter
      from the chairman of his committee in the city he represented, which
      letter informed him that he had not a chance of being re-elected. And the
      lines of his face were as composed is usual, and his foot rested as firm
      on the grim iron box; but his hand was pressed to his heart, and his eye
      was on the clock, and his voice muttered, "Dr. F&mdash;should be here!"
      And that hour Harley L'Estrange, who the previous night had charmed
      courtly crowds with his gay humour, was pacing to and fro the room in his
      hotel with restless strides and many a heavy sigh; and Leonard was
      standing by the fountain in his garden, and watching the wintry sunbeams
      that sparkled athwart the spray; and Violante was leaning on Helen's
      shoulder, and trying archly, yet innocently, to lead Helen to talk of
      Leonard; and Helen was gazing steadfastly on the floor, and answering but
      by monosyllables; and Randal Leslie was walking down to his office for the
      last time, and reading, as he passed across the Green Park, a letter from
      home, from his sister; and then, suddenly crumpling the letter in his thin
      pale hand, he looked up, beheld in the distance the spires of the great
      national Abbey; and recalling the words of our hero Nelson, he muttered,
      "Victory and Westminster, but not the Abbey!" And Randal Leslie felt that,
      within the last few days, he had made a vast stride in his ambition,&mdash;his
      grasp on the old Leslie lands, Frank Hazeldean betrothed, and possibly
      disinherited; and Dick Avenel, in the background, opening against the
      hated Lansmere interest that same seat in parliament which had first
      welcomed into public life Randal's ruined patron.

    <h2>
      INITIAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HATE AS AN AGENT IN CIVILIZED LIFE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is not an uncommon crotchet amongst benevolent men to maintain that
      wickedness is necessarily a sort of insanity, and that nobody would make a
      violent start out of the straight path unless stung to such disorder by a
      bee in his bonnet. Certainly when some very clever, well-educated person
      like our friend, Randal Leslie, acts upon the fallacious principle that
      "roguery is the best policy," it is curious to see how many points he has
      in common with the insane: what over-cunning, what irritable restlessness,
      what suspicious belief that the rest of the world are in a conspiracy
      against him, which it requires all his wit to baffle and turn to his own
      proper aggrandizement and profit. Perhaps some of my readers may have
      thought that I have represented Randal as unnaturally far-fetched in his
      schemes, too wire-drawn and subtle in his speculations; yet that is
      commonly the case with very refining intellects, when they choose to play
      the knave; it helps to disguise from themselves the ugliness of their
      ambition, just as a philosopher delights in the ingenuity of some
      metaphysical process, which ends in what plain men call "atheism," who
      would be infinitely shocked and offended if he were called an atheist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having premised thus much on behalf of the "Natural" in Randal Leslie's
      character, I must here fly off to say a word or two on the agency in human
      life exercised by a passion rarely seen without a mask in our debonair and
      civilized age,&mdash;I mean Hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the good old days of our forefathers, when plain speaking and hard
      blows were in fashion, when a man had his heart at the tip of his tongue,
      and four feet of sharp iron dangling at his side, Hate played an honest,
      open part in the theatre of the world. In fact, when we read History, Hate
      seems to have "starred it" on the stage. But now, where is Hate? Who ever
      sees its face? Is it that smiling, good-tempered creature, that presses
      you by the hand so cordially, or that dignified figure of state that calls
      you its "Right Honourable friend"? Is it that bowing, grateful dependent;
      is it that soft-eyed Amaryllis? Ask not, guess not: you will only know it
      to be hate when the poison is in your cup, or the poniard in your breast.
      In the Gothic age, grim Humour painted "the Dance of Death;" in our
      polished century, some sardonic wit should give us "the Masquerade of
      Hate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, the counter-passion betrays itself with ease to our gaze. Love
      is rarely a hypocrite. But Hate&mdash;how detect, and how guard against
      it? It lurks where you least suspect it; it is created by causes that you
      can the least foresee; and Civilization multiplies its varieties, whilst
      it favours its disguise: for Civilization increases the number of
      contending interests, and Refinement renders more susceptible to the least
      irritation the cuticle of Self-Love. But Hate comes covertly forth from
      some self-interest we have crossed, or some self-love we have wounded;
      and, dullards that we are, how seldom we are aware of our offence! You may
      be hated by a man you have never seen in your life: you may be hated as
      often by one you have loaded with benefits; you may so walk as not to
      tread on a worm; but you must sit fast on your easy-chair till you are
      carried out to your bier, if you would be sure not to tread on some snake
      of a foe. But, then, what harm does the hate do us? Very often the harm is
      as unseen by the world as the hate is unrecognized by us. It may come on
      us, unawares, in some solitary byway of our life; strike us in our
      unsuspecting privacy; thwart as in some blessed hope we have never told to
      another; for the moment the world sees that it is Hate that strikes us,
      its worst power of mischief is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a great many names for the same passion,&mdash;Envy, Jealousy,
      Spite, Prejudice, Rivalry; but they are so many synonyms for the one old
      heathen demon. When the death-giving shaft of Apollo sent the plague to
      some unhappy Achaean, it did not much matter to the victim whether the god
      were called Helios or Smintheus.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man you ever met in the world seemed more raised above the malice of
      Hate than Audley Egerton: even in the hot war of politics he had scarcely
      a personal foe; and in private life he kept himself so aloof and apart
      from others that he was little known, save by the benefits the waste of
      his wealth conferred. That the hate of any one could reach the austere
      statesman on his high pinnacle of esteem,&mdash;you would have smiled at
      the idea! But Hate is now, as it ever has been, an actual Power amidst
      "the Varieties of Life;" and, in spite of bars to the door, and policemen
      in the street, no one can be said to sleep in safety while there wakes the
      eye of a single foe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The glory of Bond Street is no more. The title of Bond Street Lounger has
      faded from our lips. In vain the crowd of equipages and the blaze of
      shops: the renown of Bond Street was in its pavement, its pedestrians. Art
      thou old enough, O reader! to remember the Bond Street Lounger and his
      incomparable generation? For my part, I can just recall the decline of the
      grand era. It was on its wane when, in the ambition of boyhood, I first
      began to muse upon high neck cloths and Wellington boots. But the ancient
      habitues&mdash;the magni nominis umbrae, contemporaries of Brummell in his
      zenith, boon companions of George IV. in his regency&mdash;still haunted
      the spot. From four to six in the hot month of June, they sauntered
      stately to and fro, looking somewhat mournful even then, foreboding the
      extinction of their race. The Bond Street Lounger was rarely seen alone:
      he was a social animal, and walked arm in arm with his fellow-man. He did
      not seem born for the cares of these ruder times; not made was he for an
      age in which Finsbury returns members to parliament. He loved his small
      talk; and never since then has talk been so pleasingly small. Your true
      Bond Street Lounger had a very dissipated look. His youth had been spent
      with heroes who loved their bottle. He himself had perhaps supped with
      Sheridan. He was by nature a spendthrift: you saw it in the roll of his
      walk. Men who make money rarely saunter; men who save money rarely
      swagger. But saunter and swagger both united to stamp PRODIGAL on the Bond
      Street Lounger. And so familiar as he was with his own set, and so
      amusingly supercilious with the vulgar residue of mortals whose faces were
      strange to Bond Street! But he is gone. The world, though sadder for his
      loss, still strives to do its best without him; and our young men,
      nowadays, attend to model cottages, and incline to Tractarianism. Still
      the place, to an unreflecting eye, has its brilliancy and bustle; but it
      is a thoroughfare, not a lounge. And adown the thoroughfare, somewhat
      before the hour when the throng is thickest, passed two gentlemen of an
      appearance exceedingly out of keeping with the place.&mdash;Yet both had
      the air of men pretending to aristocracy,&mdash;an old-world air of
      respectability and stake in the country, and Church-and-Stateism. The
      burlier of the two was even rather a beau in his way. He had first learned
      to dress, indeed, when Bond Street was at its acme, and Brummell in his
      pride. He still retained in his garb the fashion of his youth; only what
      then had spoken of the town, now betrayed the life of the country. His
      neckcloth ample and high, and of snowy whiteness, set off to comely
      advantage a face smooth-shaven, and of clear florid hues; his coat of
      royal blue, with buttons in which you might have seen yourself "veluti in
      speculum", was rather jauntily buttoned across a waist that spoke of lusty
      middle age, free from the ambition, the avarice, and the anxieties that
      fret Londoners into thread-papers; his small-clothes, of grayish drab,
      loose at the thigh and tight at the knee, were made by Brummell's own
      breeches-maker, and the gaiters to match (thrust half-way down the calf),
      had a manly dandyism that would have done honour to the beau-ideal of a
      county member. The profession of this gentleman's companion was
      unmistakable,&mdash;the shovel-hat, the clerical cut of the coat, the
      neckcloth without collar, that seemed made for its accessory the band, and
      something very decorous, yet very mild, in the whole mien of this
      personage, all spoke of one who was every inch the gentleman and the
      parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the portlier of these two persons,&mdash;"no, I can't say I
      like Frank's looks at all. There's certainly something on his mind.
      However, I suppose it will be all out this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He dines with you at your hotel, Squire? Well, you must be kind to him.
      We can't put old heads upon young shoulders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't object to his bead being young," returned the squire; "but I wish
      he had a little of Randal Leslie's good sense in it. I see how it will
      end; I must take him back to the country; and if he wants occupation, why,
      he shall keep the hounds, and I'll put him into Brooksby farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for the hounds," replied the parson, "hounds necessitate horses; and I
      think more mischief comes to a young man of spirit from the stables than
      from any other place in the world. They ought to be exposed from the
      pulpit, those stables!" added Mr. Dale, thoughtfully; "see what they
      entailed upon Nimrod! But Agriculture is a healthful and noble pursuit,
      honoured by sacred nations, and cherished by the greatest men in classical
      times. For instance, the Athenians were&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bother the Athenians!" cried the squire, irreverently; "you need not go
      so far back for an example. It is enough for a Hazeldean that his father
      and his grandfather and his great-grandfather all farmed before him; and a
      devilish deal better, I take it, than any of those musty old Athenians, no
      offence to them. But I'll tell you one thing, Parson, a man to farm well,
      and live in the country, should have a wife; it is half the battle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to a battle, a man who is married is pretty sure of half, though not
      always the better half, of it," answered the parson, who seemed peculiarly
      facetious that day. "Ah, Squire, I wish I could think Mrs. Hazeldean right
      in her conjecture!&mdash;you would have the prettiest daughter-in-law in
      the three kingdoms. And I do believe that, if I could have a good talk
      with the young lady apart from her father, we could remove the only
      objection I know to the marriage. Those Popish errors&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, very true!" cried the squire; "that Pope sticks hard in my gizzard. I
      could excuse her being a foreigner, and not having, I suppose, a shilling
      in her pocket&mdash;bless her handsome face!&mdash;but to be worshipping
      images in her room instead of going to the parish church, that will never
      do. But you think you could talk her out of the Pope, and into the family
      pew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I could have talked her father out of the Pope, only, when he had
      not a word to say for himself, he bolted out of the window. Youth is more
      ingenuous in confessing its errors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I own," said the squire, "that both Harry and I had a favourite notion of
      ours till this Italian girl got into our heads. Do you know we both took a
      great fancy to Randal's little sister,&mdash;pretty, blushing,
      English-faced girl as ever you saw. And it went to Harry's good heart to
      see her so neglected by that silly, fidgety mother of hers, her hair
      hanging about her ears; and I thought it would be a fine way to bring
      Randal and Frank more together, and enable me to do something for Randal
      himself,&mdash;a good boy with Hazeldean blood in his veins. But Violante
      is so handsome, that I don't wonder at the boy's choice; and then it is
      our fault,&mdash;we let them see so much of each other as children.
      However, I should be very angry if Rickeybockey had been playing sly, and
      running away from the Casino in order to give Frank an opportunity to
      carry on a clandestine intercourse with his daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that would be like Riccabocca; more like him to run away in
      order to deprive Frank of the best of all occasions to court Violante, if
      he so desired; for where could he see more of her than at the Casino?"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"That's well put. Considering he was only a foreign doctor,
      and, for aught we know, once went about in a caravan, he is a
      gentleman-like fellow, that Rickeybockey. I speak of people as I find
      them. But what is your notion about Frank? I see you don't think he is in
      love with Violante, after all. Out with it, man; speak plain."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Since you so urge me, I own I do not think him in love with
      her; neither does my Carry, who is uncommonly shrewd in such matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Your Carry, indeed!&mdash;as if she were half as shrewd as
      my Harry. Carry&mdash;nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (reddening).&mdash;"I don't want to make invidious remarks; but,
      Mr. Hazeldean, when you sneer at my Carry, I should not be a man if I did
      not say that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (interrupting).&mdash;"She is a good little woman enough; but to
      compare her to my Harry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"I don't compare her to your Harry; I don't compare her to
      any woman in England, Sir. But you are losing your temper, Mr. Hazeldean!"
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"I!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"And people are staring at you, Mr. Hazeldean. For decency's
      sake, compose yourself, and change the subject. We are just at the Albany.
      I hope that we shall not find poor Captain Higginbotham as ill as he
      represents himself in his letter. Ah, is it possible? No, it cannot be.
      Look&mdash;look!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Where&mdash;what&mdash;where? Don't pinch so hard. Bless
      me, do you see a ghost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"There! the gentleman in black!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Gentleman in black! What! in broad daylight! Nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the parson made a spring forward, and, catching the arm of the person
      in question, who himself had stopped, and was gazing intently on the pair,
      exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, pardon me; but is not your name Fairfield? Ah, it is Leonard,&mdash;it
      is&mdash;my dear, dear boy! What joy! So altered, so improved, but still
      the same honest face. Squire, come here&mdash;your old friend, Leonard
      Fairfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he wanted to persuade me," said the squire, shaking Leonard heartily
      by the hand, "that you were the Gentleman in Black; but, indeed, he has
      been in strange humours and tantrums all the morning. Well, Master Lenny;
      why, you are grown quite a gentleman! The world thrives with you, eh? I
      suppose you are head-gardener to some grandee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that, sir," said Leonard, smiling; "but the world has thriven with me
      at last, though not without some rough usage at starting. Ah, Mr. Dale,
      you can little guess how often I have thought of you and your discourse on
      Knowledge; and, what is more, how I have lived to feel the truth of your
      words, and to bless the lesson."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (much touched and flattered).&mdash;"I expected nothing less from
      you, Leonard; you were always a lad of great sense, and sound judgment. So
      you have thought of my little discourse on Knowledge, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Hang knowledge! I have reason to hate the word. It burned
      down three ricks of mine; the finest ricks you ever set eyes on, Mr.
      Fairfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"That was not knowledge, Squire; that was ignorance."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Ignorance! The deuce it was. I'll just appeal to you, Mr.
      Fairfield. We have been having sad riots in the shire, and the ringleader
      was just such another lad as you were!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Hazeldean. In what
      respect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Why, he was a village genius, and always reading some
      cursed little tract or other; and got mighty discontented with King,
      Lords, and Commons, I suppose, and went about talking of the wrongs of the
      poor, and the crimes of the rich, till, by Jove, sir, the whole mob rose
      one day with pitchforks and sickles, and smash went Farmer Smart's
      thrashing-machines; and on the same night my ricks were on fire. We caught
      the rogues, and they were all tried; but the poor deluded labourers were
      let off with a short imprisonment. The village genius, thank Heaven, is
      sent packing to Botany Bay."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"But did his books teach him to burn ricks and smash
      machines?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"No; he said quite the contrary, and declared that he had no
      hand in those misdoings."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"But he was proved to have excited, with his wild talk, the
      boobies who had! 'Gad, sir, there was a hypocritical Quaker once, who said
      to his enemy, 'I can't shed thy blood, friend, but I will hold thy head
      under water till thou art drowned.' And so there is a set of demagogical
      fellows, who keep calling out, 'Farmer, this is an oppressor, and Squire,
      that is a vampire! But no violence! Don't smash their machines, don't burn
      their ricks! Moral force, and a curse on all tyrants!' Well, and if poor
      Hodge thinks moral force is all my eye, and that the recommendation is to
      be read backwards, in the devil's way of reading the Lord's prayer, I
      should like to know which of the two ought to go to Botany Bay,&mdash;Hodge,
      who comes out like a man, if he thinks he is wronged, or t' other sneaking
      chap, who makes use of his knowledge to keep himself out of the scrape?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"It may be very true; but when I saw that poor fellow at the
      bar, with his intelligent face, and heard his bold clear defence, and
      thought of all his hard struggles for knowledge, and how they had ended,
      because he forgot that knowledge is like fire, and must not be thrown
      amongst flax,&mdash;why, I could have given my right hand to save him.
      And, oh, Squire, do you remember his poor mother's shriek of despair when
      he was sentenced to transportation for life&mdash;I hear it now! And what,
      Leonard&mdash;what do you think had misled him? At the bottom of all the
      mischief was a tinker's bag. You cannot forget Sprott?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"Tinker's bag! Sprott!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"That rascal, sir, was the hardest follow to nab you could
      possibly conceive; as full of quips and quirks as an Old Bailey lawyer.
      But we managed to bring it home to him. Lord! his bag was choke-full of
      tracts against every man who had a good coat on his back; and as if that
      was not enough, cheek by jowl with the tracts were lucifers, contrived on
      a new principle, for teaching my ricks the theory of spontaneous
      combustion. The labourers bought the lucifers&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"And the poor village genius bought the tracts."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"All headed with a motto, 'To teach the working classes that
      knowledge is power.' So that I was right in saying that knowledge had
      burnt my ricks; knowledge inflamed the village genius, the village genius
      inflamed fellows more ignorant than himself, and they inflamed my
      stackyard. However, lucifers, tracts, village genius, and Sprott are all
      off to Botany Bay; and the shire has gone on much the better for it. So no
      more of your knowledge for me, begging your pardon, Mr. Fairfield. Such
      uncommonly fine ricks as mine were too! I declare, Parson, you are looking
      as if you felt pity for Sprott; and I saw you, indeed, whispering to him
      as he was taken out of court."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (looking sheepish).&mdash;"Indeed, Squire, I was only asking him
      what had become of his donkey, an unoffending creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Unoffending! Upset me amidst a thistle-bed in my own
      village green! I remember it. Well, what did he say had become of the
      donkey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"He said but one word; but that showed all the
      vindictiveness of his disposition. He said it with a horrid wink, that
      made my blood run cold. 'What's become of your poor donkey?' said I, and
      he answered&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Go on. He answered&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"'Sausages.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Sausages! Like enough; and sold to the poor; and that's
      what the poor will come to if they listen to such revolutionizing
      villains. Sausages! Donkey sausages!" (spitting)&mdash;"'T is bad as
      eating one another; perfect cannibalism."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, who had been thrown into grave thought by the history of Sprott
      and the village genius, now pressing the parson's hand, asked permission
      to wait on him before Mr. Dale quitted London; and was about to withdraw,
      when the parson, gently detaining him, said, "No; don't leave me yet,
      Leonard,&mdash;I have so much to ask you, and to talk about. I shall be at
      leisure shortly. We are just now going to call on a relation of the
      squire's, whom you must recollect, I am sure,&mdash;Captain Higginbotham&mdash;Barnabas
      Higginbotham. He is very poorly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I am sure he would take it kind in you to call too," said the squire,
      with great good-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"Nay, sir, would not that be a great liberty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Liberty! To ask a poor sick gentleman how he is? Nonsense.
      And I say, Sir, perhaps, as no doubt you have been living in town, and
      know more of newfangled notions than I do,&mdash;perhaps you can tell us
      whether or not it is all humbug,&mdash;that new way of doctoring people."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"What new way, sir. There are so many."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Are there? Folks in London do look uncommonly sickly. But
      my poor cousin (he was never a Solomon) has got hold, he says, of a homely&mdash;homely&mdash;What's
      the word, Parson?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON. "Homoeopathist."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"That's it. You see the captain went to live with one Sharpe
      Currie, a relation who had a great deal of money, and very little liver;&mdash;made
      the one, and left much of the other in Ingee, you understand. The captain
      had expectations of the money. Very natural, I dare say; but Lord, sir,
      what do you think has happened? Sharpe Currie has done him. Would not die,
      Sir; got back his liver, and the captain has lost his own. Strangest thing
      you ever heard. And then the ungrateful old Nabob has dismissed the
      captain, saying, 'He can't bear to have invalids about him;' and is going
      to marry, and I have no doubt will have children by the dozen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"It was in Germany, at one of the Spas, that Mr. Currie
      recovered; and as he had the selfish inhumanity to make the captain go
      through a course of waters simultaneously with himself, it has so chanced
      that the same waters that cured Mr. Currie's liver have destroyed Captain
      Higginbotham's. An English homoeopathic physician, then staying at the
      Spa, has attended the captain hither, and declares that he will restore
      him by infinitesimal doses of the same chemical properties that were found
      in the waters which diseased him. Can there be anything in such a theory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD.&mdash;"I once knew a very able, though eccentric homoeopathist,
      and I am inclined to believe there may be something in the system. My
      friend went to Germany; it may possibly be the same person who attends the
      captain. May I ask his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Cousin Barnabas does not mention it. You may ask it of
      himself, for here we are at his chambers. I say, Parson" (whispering
      slyly), "if a small dose of what hurt the captain is to cure him, don't
      you think the proper thing would be a&mdash;legacy? Ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON (trying not to laugh).&mdash;"Hush, Squire. Poor human nature! We
      must be merciful to its infirmities. Come in, Leonard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard, interested in his doubt whether he might thus chance again upon
      Dr. Morgan, obeyed the invitation, and with his two companions followed
      the woman, who "did for the captain and his rooms," across the small
      lobby, into the presence of the sufferer.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whatever the disposition towards merriment at his cousin's expense
      entertained by the squire, it vanished instantly at the sight of the
      captain's doleful visage and emaciated figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good in you to come to town to see me,&mdash;very good in you,
      cousin, and in you, too, Mr. Dale. How very well you are both looking! I'm
      a sad wreck. You might count every bone in my body."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hazeldean air and roast beef will soon set you up, my boy," said the
      squire, kindly. "You were a great goose to leave them, and these
      comfortable rooms of yours in the Albany."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are comfortable, though not showy," said the captain, with tears in
      his eyes. "I had done my best to make them so. New carpets, this very
      chair&mdash;(morocco!), that Japan cat (holds toast and muffins)&mdash;just
      when&mdash;just when"&mdash;(the tears here broke forth, and the captain
      fairly whimpered)&mdash;"just when that ungrateful, bad-hearted man wrote
      me word 'he was&mdash;was dying and lone in the world;' and&mdash;and&mdash;to
      think what I've gone through for him;&mdash;and to treat me so! Cousin
      William, he has grown as hale as yourself, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheer up, cheer up!" cried the compassionate squire. "It is a very hard
      case, I allow. But you see, as the old proverb says, ''T is ill waiting
      for a dead man's shoes;' and in future&mdash;I don't mean offence&mdash;but
      I think if you would calculate less on the livers of your relations, it
      would be all the better for your own. Excuse me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cousin William," replied the poor captain, "I am sure I never calculated;
      but still, if you had seen that deceitful man's good-for-nothing face&mdash;as
      yellow as a guinea&mdash;and have gone through all I've gone through, you
      would have felt cut to the heart, as I do. I can't bear ingratitude. I
      never could. But let it pass. Will that gentleman take a chair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"Mr. Fairfield has kindly called with us, because he knows
      something of this system of homeeopathy which you have adopted, and may,
      perhaps, know the practitioner. What is the name of your doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN (looking at his watch).&mdash;"That reminds me" (swallowing a
      globule). "A great relief these little pills&mdash;after the physic I've
      taken to please that malignant man. He always tried his doctor's stuff
      upon me. But there's another world, and a juster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With that pious conclusion the captain again began to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Touched," muttered the squire, with his forefinger on his forehead. "You
      seem to have a good&mdash;tidy sort of a nurse here, Cousin Barnabas. I
      hope she 's pleasant, and lively, and don't let you take on so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hist!&mdash;don't talk of her. All mercenary; every bit of her fawning!
      Would you believe it? I give her ten shillings a week, besides all that
      goes down of my pats of butter and rolls, and I overheard the jade saying
      to the laundress that 'I could not last long; and she 'd&mdash;EXPECTATIONS!'
      Ah, Mr. Dale, when one thinks of the sinfulness there is in this life! But
      I'll not think of it. No, I'll not. Let us change the subject. You were
      asking my doctor's name. It is&mdash;"

      announced "DR. MORGAN."

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The parson started, and so did Leonard.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The homoeopathist did not at first notice either. With an unobservant bow
      to the visitors, he went straight to the patient, and asked, "How go the
      symptoms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewith the captain commenced, in a tone of voice like a schoolboy
      reciting the catalogue of the ships in Homer. He had been evidently
      conning the symptoms, and learning them by heart. Nor was there a single
      nook or corner in his anatomical organization, so far as the captain was
      acquainted with that structure, but what some symptom or other was dragged
      therefrom, and exposed to day. The squire listened with horror to the
      morbific inventory, muttering at each dread interval, "Bless me! Lord
      bless me! What, more still! Death would be a very happy release!"
      Meanwhile the doctor endured the recital with exemplary patience, noting
      down in the leaves of his pocketbook what appeared to him the salient
      points in this fortress of disease to which he had laid siege, and then,
      drawing forth a minute paper said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital,&mdash;nothing can be better. This powder must be dissolved in
      eight tablespoonfuls of water; one spoonful every two hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tablespoonful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tablespoonful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Nothing can be better,' did you say, sir?" repeated the squire, who in
      his astonishment at that assertion applied to the captain's description of
      his sufferings, had hitherto hung fire,&mdash;"nothing can be better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the diagnosis, sir!" replied Dr. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the dogs' noses, very possibly," quoth the squire; "but for the
      inside of Cousin Higginbotham, I should think nothing could be worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken, sir," replied Dr. Morgan. "It is not the captain who
      speaks here,&mdash;it is his liver. Liver, sir, though a noble, is an
      imaginative organ, and indulges in the most extraordinary fictions. Seat
      of poetry and love and jealousy&mdash;the liver. Never believe what it
      says. You have no idea what a liar it is! But&mdash;ahem&mdash;ahem. Cott&mdash;I
      think I've seen you before, sir. Surely your name's Hazeldean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "William Hazeldean, at your service, Doctor. But where have you seen me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the hustings at Lansmere. You were speaking on behalf of your
      distinguished brother, Mr. Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang it!" cried the squire: "I think it must have been my liver that
      spoke there! for I promised the electors that that half-brother of mine
      would stick by the land, and I never told a bigger lie in my life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the patient, reminded of his other visitors, and afraid he was going
      to be bored with the enumeration of the squire's wrongs, and probably the
      whole history of his duel with Captain Dashmore, turned with a languid
      wave of his hand, and said, "Doctor, another friend of mine, the Rev. Mr.
      Dale, and a gentleman who is acquainted with homoeopathy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dale? What, more old friends!" cried the doctor, rising; and the parson
      came somewhat reluctantly from the window nook, to which he had retired.
      The parson and the homoeopathist shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have met before on a very mournful occasion," said the doctor, with
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson held his finger to his lips, and glanced towards Leonard. The
      doctor stared at the lad, but he did not recognize in the person before
      him the gaunt, care-worn boy whom he had placed with Mr. Prickett, until
      Leonard smiled and spoke. And the smile and the voice sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cott! and it is the poy!" cried Dr. Morgan; and he actually caught hold
      of Leonard, and gave him an affectionate Welch hug. Indeed, his agitation
      at these several surprises became so great that he stopped short, drew
      forth a globule&mdash;"Aconite,&mdash;good against nervous shocks!" and
      swallowed it incontinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gad," said the squire, rather astonished, "'t is the first doctor I ever
      saw swallow his own medicine! There must be something in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain now, highly disgusted that so much attention was withdrawn
      from his own case, asked in a querulous voice, "And as to diet? What shall
      I have for dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend!" said the doctor, wiping his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zounds!" cried the squire, retreating, "do you mean to say, that the
      British laws (to be sure they are very much changed of late) allow you to
      diet your patients upon their fellow-men? Why, Parson, this is worse than
      the donkey sausages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Dr. Morgan, gravely, "I mean to say, that it matters little
      what we eat in comparison with care as to whom we eat with. It is better
      to exceed a little with a friend than to observe the strictest regimen,
      and eat alone. Talk and laughter help the digestion, and are indispensable
      in affections of the liver. I have no doubt, sir, that it was my patient's
      agreeable society that tended to restore to health his dyspeptic relative,
      Mr. Sharpe Currie."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, therefore, if one of you gentlemen will stay and dine with Mr.
      Higginbotham, it will greatly assist the effects of his medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain turned an imploring eye, first towards his cousin, then
      towards the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I 'm engaged to dine with my son&mdash;very sorry," said the squire. "But
      Dale, here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he will be so kind," put in the captain, "we might cheer the evening
      with a game at whist,&mdash;double dummy." Now, poor Mr. Dale had set his
      heart on dining with an old college friend, and having no stupid, prosy
      double dummy, in which one cannot have the pleasure of scolding one's
      partner, but a regular orthodox rubber, with the pleasing prospect of
      scolding all the three other performers. But as his quiet life forbade him
      to be a hero in great things, the parson had made up his mind to be a hero
      in small ones. Therefore, though with rather a rueful face, he accepted
      the captain's invitation, and promised to return at six o'clock to dine.
      Meanwhile he must hurry off to the other end of the town, and excuse
      himself from the pre-engagement he had already formed. He now gave his
      card, with the address of a quiet family hotel thereon, to Leonard, and
      not looking quite so charmed with Dr. Morgan as he was before that
      unwelcome prescription, he took his leave. The squire too, having to see a
      new churn, and execute various commissions for his Harry, went his way
      (not, however, till Dr. Morgan had assured him that, in a few weeks, the
      captain might safely remove to Hazeldean); and Leonard was about to
      follow, when Morgan hooked his arm in his old protege, and said, "But I
      must have some talk with you; and you have to tell me all about the little
      orphan girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard could not resist the pleasure of talking about Helen; and he got
      into the carriage, which was waiting at the door for the homoeopathist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going in the country a few miles to see a patient," said the doctor;
      "so we shall have time for undisturbed consultation. I have so often
      wondered what had become of you. Not hearing from Prickett, I wrote to
      him, and received from his heir an answer as dry as a bone. Poor fellow, I
      found that he had neglected his globules and quitted the globe. Alas,
      'pulvis et umbra sumus!' I could learn no tidings of you. Prickett's
      successor declared he knew nothing about you. I hoped the best; for I
      always fancied you were one who would fall on your legs,&mdash;bilious-nervous
      temperament; such are the men who succeed in their undertakings,
      especially if they take a spoonful of chamomilla whenever they are
      over-excited. So now for your history and the little girl's,&mdash;pretty
      little thing,&mdash;never saw a more susceptible constitution, nor one
      more suited to pulsatilla."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard briefly related his own struggles and success, and informed the
      good doctor how they had at last discovered the nobleman in whom poor
      Captain Digby had confided, and whose care of the orphan had justified the
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Morgan opened his eyes at hearing the name of Lord L'Estrange. "I
      remember him very well," said he, "when I practised murder as an
      allopathist at Lansmere. But to think that wild boy, so full of whim and
      life and spirit, should become staid enough for a guardian to that dear
      little child, with her timid eyes and pulsatilla sensibilities. Well,
      wonders never cease! And he has befriended you too, you say. Ah, he knew
      your family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he says. Do you think, sir, that he ever knew&mdash;ever saw&mdash;my
      mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! your mother?&mdash;Nora?" exclaimed the doctor, quickly; and, as if
      struck by some sudden thought, his brows met, and he remained silent and
      musing a few moments; then, observing Leonard's eyes fixed on him
      earnestly, he replied to the question,
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt he saw her; she was brought up at Lady Lansmere's. Did he not
      tell you so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No." A vague suspicion here darted through Leonard's mind, but as
      suddenly vanished. His father! Impossible. His father must have
      deliberately wronged the dead mother. And was Harley L'Estrange a man
      capable of such wrong? And had he been Harley's son, would not Harley have
      guessed it at once, and so guessing, have owned and claimed him? Besides,
      Lord L'Estrange looked so young,&mdash;old enough to be Leonard's father!&mdash;he
      could not entertain the idea. He roused himself and said, falteringly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told me you did not know by what name I should call my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I told you the truth, to the best of my belief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By your honour, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my honour, I do not know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now a long silence. The carriage had long left London, and was
      on a high road somewhat lonelier, and more free from houses than most of
      those which form the entrances to the huge city. Leonard gazed wistfully
      from the window, and the objects that met his eyes gradually seemed to
      appeal to his memory. Yes! it was the road by which he had first
      approached the metropolis, hand in hand with Helen&mdash;and hope so busy
      at his poet's heart. He sighed deeply. He thought he would willingly have
      resigned all he had won&mdash;independence, fame, all&mdash;to feel again
      the clasp of that tender hand, again to be the sole protector of that
      gentle life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's voice broke on his revery. "I am going to see a very
      interesting patient,&mdash;coats to his stomach quite worn out, sir,&mdash;man
      of great learning, with a very inflamed cerebellum. I can't do him much
      good, and he does me a great deal of harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How harm?" asked Leonard, with an effort at some rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hits me on the heart, and makes my eyes water; very pathetic case,&mdash;grand
      creature, who has thrown himself away. Found him given over by the
      allopathists, and in a high state of delirium tremens, restored him for a
      time, took a great liking to him,&mdash;could not help it,&mdash;swallowed
      a great many globules to harden myself against him, would not do, brought
      him over to England with the other patients, who all pay me well (except
      Captain Higginbotham). But this poor fellow pays me nothing,&mdash;costs
      me a great deal in time and turnpikes, and board and lodging. Thank
      Heaven, I'm a single man, and can afford it! My poy, I would let all the
      other patients go to the allopathists if I could but save this poor, big,
      penniless, princely fellow. But what can one do with a stomach that has
      not a rag of its coats left? Stop" (the doctor pulled the check-string).
      "This is the stile. I get out here and go across the fields."
    </p>
    <p>
      That stile, those fields&mdash;with what distinctness Leonard remembered
      them. Ah, where was Helen? Could she ever, ever again be, his child-angel?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go with you, if you permit," said he to the good doctor. "And
      while you pay your visit, I will saunter by a little brook that I think
      must run by your way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Brent&mdash;you know that brook? Ah, you should hear my poor patient
      talk of it, and of the hours he has spent angling in it,&mdash;you would
      not know whether to laugh or cry. The first day he was brought down to the
      place, he wanted to go out and try once more, he said, for his old
      deluding demon,&mdash;a one-eyed perch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens!" exclaimed Leonard, "are you speaking of John Burley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure, that is his name,&mdash;John Burley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, has it come to this? Cure him, save him, if it be in human power. For
      the last two years I have sought his trace everywhere, and in vain, the
      moment I had money of my own, a home of my own. Poor, erring, glorious
      Burley! Take me to him. Did you say there was no hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say that," replied the doctor. "But art can only assist Nature;
      and though Nature is ever at work to repair the injuries we do to her,
      yet, when the coats of a stomach are all gone, she gets puzzled, and so do
      I. You must tell me another time how you came to know Burley, for here we
      are at the house, and I see him at the window looking out for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor opened the garden gate of the quiet cottage to which poor
      Burley had fled from the pure presence of Leonard's child-angel. And with
      heavy step, and heavy heart, Leonard mournfully followed, to behold the
      wrecks of him whose wit had glorified orgy, and "set the table in a roar."
      Alas, poor Yorick!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Audley Egerton stands on his hearth alone. During the short interval that
      has elapsed since we last saw him, events had occurred memorable in
      English history, wherewith we have nought to do in a narrative studiously
      avoiding all party politics even when treating of politicians. The new
      ministers had stated the general programme of their policy, and introduced
      one measure in especial that had lifted them at once to the dizzy height
      of popular power. But it became clear that this measure could not be
      carried without a fresh appeal to the people. A dissolution of parliament,
      as Audley's sagacious experience had foreseen, was inevitable. And Audley
      Egerton had no chance of return for his own seat, for the great commercial
      city identified with his name. Oh, sad, but not rare, instance of the
      mutabilities of that same popular favour now enjoyed by his successors!
      The great commoner, the weighty speaker, the expert man of business, the
      statesman who had seemed a type of the practical steady sense for which
      our middle class is renowned,&mdash;he who, not three years since, might
      have had his honoured choice of the largest popular constituencies in the
      kingdom,&mdash;he, Audley Egerton, knew not one single town (free from the
      influences of private property or interest) in which the obscurest
      candidate, who bawled out for the new liberal measure, would not have
      beaten him hollow. Where one popular hustings, on which that grave
      sonorous voice, that had stilled so often the roar of faction, would not
      be drowned amidst the hoots of the scornful mob?
    </p>
    <p>
      True, what were called the close boroughs still existed; true, many a
      chief of his party would have been too proud of the honour of claiming
      Andley Egerton for his nominee. But the ex-minister's haughty soul shrunk
      from this contrast to his past position. And to fight against the popular
      measure, as member of one of the seats most denounced by the people,&mdash;he
      felt it was a post in the grand army of parties below his dignity to
      occupy, and foreign to his peculiar mind, which required the sense of
      consequence and station. And if, in a few months, those seats were swept
      away&mdash;were annihilated from the rolls of parliament&mdash;where was
      he? Moreover, Egerton, emancipated from the trammels that had bound his
      will while his party was in office, desired, in the turn of events, to be
      nominee of no man,&mdash;desired to stand at least freely and singly on
      the ground of his own services, be guided by his own penetration; no law
      for action but his strong sense and his stout English heart. Therefore he
      had declined all offers from those who could still bestow seats in
      parliament. Seats that he could purchase with hard gold were yet open to
      him. And the L5,000 he had borrowed from Levy were yet untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this lone public man, public life, as we have seen, was the all in all.
      But now more than ever it was vital to his very wants. Around him yawned
      ruin. He knew that it was in Levy's power at any moment to foreclose on
      his mortgaged lands; to pour in the bonds and the bills which lay within
      those rosewood receptacles that lined the fatal lair of the sleek usurer;
      to seize on the very house in which now moved all the pomp of a retinue
      that vied with the valetaille of dukes; to advertise for public auction,
      under execution, "the costly effects of the Right Hon. Audley Egerton."
      But, consummate in his knowledge of the world, Egerton felt assured that
      Levy would not adopt these measures against him while he could still tower
      in the van of political war,&mdash;while he could still see before him the
      full chance of restoration to power, perhaps to power still higher than
      before, perhaps to power the highest of all beneath the throne. That Levy,
      whose hate he divined, though he did not conjecture all its causes, had
      hitherto delayed even a visit, even a menace, seemed to him to show that
      Levy still thought him one "to be helped," or, at least, one too powerful
      to crush. To secure his position in parliament unshackled, unfallen, if
      but for another year,&mdash;new combinations of party might arise, new
      reactions take place, in public opinion! And, with his hand pressed to his
      heart, the stern firm man muttered, "If not, I ask but to die in my
      harness, and that men may not know that I am a pauper until all that I
      need from my country is a grave."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had these words died upon his lips ere two quick knocks in
      succession resounded at the street door. In another moment Harley entered,
      and, at the same time, the servant in attendance approached Audley, and
      announced Baron Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beg the baron to wait, unless he would prefer to name his own hour to
      call again," answered Egerton, with the slightest possible change of
      colour. "You can say I am now with Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had hoped you had done forever with that deluder of youth," said
      Harley, as soon as the groom of the chambers had withdrawn. "I remember
      that you saw too much of him in the gay time, ere wild oats are sown; but
      now surely you can never need a loan; and if so is not Harley L'Estrange
      by your side?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"My dear Harley! doubtless he but comes to talk to me of
      some borough. He has much to do with those delicate negotiations."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"And I have come on the same business. I claim the priority.
      I not only hear in the world, but I see by the papers, that Josiah
      Jenkins, Esq., known to fame as an orator who leaves out his h's, and
      young Lord Willoughby Whiggolin, who is just made a Lord of the Admiralty,
      because his health is too delicate for the army, are certain to come in
      for the city which you and your present colleague will as certainly
      vacate. That is true, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"My old Committee now vote for Jenkins and Whiggolin; and I
      suppose there will not be even a contest. Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So my father and I are agreed that you must condescend, for the sake of
      old friendship, to be once more member for Lansmere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley," exclaimed Egerton, changing countenance far more than he had
      done at the announcement of Levy's portentous visit, "Harley, no, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! But why? Wherefore such emotion?" asked L'Estrauge, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"I suggested the idea to two or three of the late ministers;
      they all concur in advising you to accede. In the first place, if
      declining to stand for the place which tempted you from Lansmere, what
      more natural than that you should fall back on that earlier
      representation? In the second place, Lansmere is neither a rotten borough
      to be bought, nor a close borough, under one man's nomination. It is a
      tolerably large constituency. My father, it is true, has considerable
      interest in it, but only what is called the legitimate influence of
      property. At all events, it is more secure than a contest for a larger
      town, more dignified than a seat for a smaller. Hesitating still? Even my
      mother entreats me to say how she desires you to renew that connection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley," again exclaimed Egerton; and fixing upon his friend's earnest
      face eyes which, when softened by emotion, were strangely beautiful in
      their expression,&mdash;"Harley, if you could but read my heart at this
      moment, you would&mdash;you would&mdash;" His voice faltered, and he
      fairly bent his proud head upon Harley's shoulder; grasping the hand he
      had caught nervously, clingingly, "Oh, Harley, if I ever lose your love,
      your friendship, nothing else is left to me in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Audley, my dear, dear Audley, is it you who speak to me thus? You, my
      school friend, my life's confidant,&mdash;you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am grown very weak and foolish," said Egerton, trying to smile. "I do
      not know myself. I, too, whom you have so often called 'Stoic,' and
      likened to the Iron Man in the poem which you used to read by the
      riverside at Eton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But even then, my Audley, I knew that a warm human heart (do what you
      would to keep it down) beat strong under the iron ribs. And I often marvel
      now, to think you have gone through life so free from the wilder passions.
      Happier so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton, who had turned his face from his friend's gaze, remained silent
      for a few moments; and he then sought to divert the conversation, and
      roused himself to ask Harley how he had succeeded in his views upon
      Beatrice, and his watch on the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With regard to Peschiera," answered Harley, "I think we must have
      overrated the danger we apprehended, and that his wagers were but an idle
      boast. He has remained quiet enough, and seems devoted to play. His sister
      has shut her doors both on myself and my young associate during the last
      few days. I almost fear that in spite of very sage warnings of mine, she
      must have turned his poet's head, and that either he has met with some
      scornful rebuff to incautious admiration or that, he himself has grown
      aware of peril, and declines to face it; for he is very much embarrassed
      when I speak to him respecting her. But if the count is not formidable,
      why, his sister is not needed; and I hope yet to get justice for my
      Italian friend through the ordinary channels. I have secured an ally in a
      young Austrian prince, who is now in London, and who has promised to back,
      with all his influence, a memorial I shall transmit to Vienna.&mdash;a
      propos, my dear Audley, now that you have a little breathing-time, you
      must fix an hour for me to present to you my young poet, the son of her
      sister. At moments the expression of his face is so like hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay," answered Egerton, quickly, "I will see him as you wish, but
      later. I have not yet that breathing-time you speak of; but you say he has
      prospered; and, with your friendship, he is secure from fortune. I rejoice
      to think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your own protege, this Vandal Leslie, whom you forbid me to dislike&mdash;hard
      task!&mdash;what has he decided?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To adhere to my fate. Harley, if it please Heaven that I do not live to
      return to power, and provide adequately for that young man, do not forget
      that he clung to me in my fall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he still cling to you faithfully, I will never forget it. I will
      forget only all that now makes me doubt him. But you talk of not living,
      Audley! Pooh! your frame is that of a predestined octogenarian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," answered Audley, "I was but uttering one of those vague
      generalities which are common upon all mortal lips. And now farewell,&mdash;I
      must see this baron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, until you have promised to consent to my proposal, and be once
      more member for Lansmere. Tut! don't shake your head. I cannot be denied.
      I claim your promise in right of our friendship, and shall be seriously
      hurt if you even pause to reflect on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, I know not how to refuse you, Harley; but you have not been
      to Lansmere yourself since&mdash;since that sad event. You must not revive
      the old wound,&mdash;you must not go; and&mdash;and, I own it, Harley, the
      remembrance of it pains even me. I would rather not go to Lansmere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my friend, this is an excess of sympathy, and I cannot listen to it.
      I begin even to blame my own weakness, and to feel that we have no right
      to make ourselves the soft slaves of the past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do appear to me of late to have changed," cried Egerton, suddenly,
      and with a brightening aspect. "Do tell me that you are happy in the
      contemplation of your new ties,&mdash;that I shall live to see you once
      more restored to your former self."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I can answer, Audley," said L'Estrange, with a thoughtful brow, "is,
      that you are right in one thing,&mdash;I am changed; and I am struggling
      to gain strength for duty and for honour. Adieu! I shall tell my father
      that you accede to our wishes."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Harley was gone, Egerton sunk back on his chair, as if in extreme
      physical or mental exhaustion, all the lines of his countenance relaxed
      and jaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To go back to that place&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;where&mdash;Courage,
      courage! what is another pang?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose with an effort, and folding his arms tightly across his breast,
      paced slowly to and fro the large, mournful, solitary room. Gradually his
      countenance assumed its usual cold and austere composure,&mdash;the secret
      eye, the guarded lip, the haughty, collected front. The man of the world
      was himself once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now to gain time, and to baffle the usurer," murmured Egerton, with that
      low tone of easy scorn, which bespoke consciousness of superior power and
      the familiar mastery over hostile natures. He rang the bell: the servant
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Baron Levy still waiting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admit him." Levy entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Levy," said the ex-minister, "for having so long
      detained you. I am now at your commands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," returned the baron, "no apologies between friends so old
      as we are; and I fear that my business is not so agreeable as to make you
      impatient to discuss it."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (with perfect composure).&mdash;"I am to conclude, then, that you
      wish to bring our accounts to a close. Whenever you will, Levy."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON (disconcerted and surprised).&mdash;"Peste! mon cher, you take
      things coolly. But if our accounts are closed, I fear you will have but
      little to live upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"I can continue to live on the salary of a Cabinet
      Minister."
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"Possibly; but you are no longer a Cabinet Minister."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"You have never found me deceived&mdash;in a political
      prediction. Within twelve months (should life be spared to me) I shall be
      in office again. If the same to you, I would rather wait till then
      formally and amicably to resign to you my lands and this house. If you
      grant that reprieve, our connection can thus close without the eclat and
      noise which may be invidious to you, as it would be disagreeable to me.
      But if that delay be inconvenient, I will appoint a lawyer to examine your
      accounts, and adjust my liabilities."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON (soliloquizing).&mdash;"I don't like this. A lawyer! That may be
      awkward."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (observing the baron, with a curl on his lip). "Well, Levy, how
      shall it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON.&mdash;"You know, my dear fellow, it is not my character to be
      hard on any one, least of all upon an old friend. And if you really think
      there is a chance of your return to office, which you apprehend that an
      esclandre as to your affairs at present might damage, why, let us see if
      we can conciliate matters. But, first, mon cher, in order to become a
      minister, you must at least have a seat in parliament; and pardon me the
      question, how the deuce are you to find one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"It is found."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON.&mdash;"Ah, I forgot the L5,000 you last borrowed."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"NO; I reserve that sum for another purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON (with a forced laugh).&mdash;"Perhaps to defend yourself against
      the actions you apprehend from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"You are mistaken. But to soothe your suspicions I will
      tell you plainly, that finding any sum I might have insured on my life
      would be liable to debts preincurred, and (as you will be my sole
      creditor) might thus at my death pass back to you; and doubting whether,
      indeed, any office would accept my insurance, I appropriate that sum to
      the relief of my conscience. I intend to bestow it, while yet in life,
      upon my late wife's kinsman, Randal Leslie. And it is solely the wish to
      do what I consider an act of justice, that has prevailed with me to accept
      a favour from the hands of Harley L'Estrange, and to become again the
      member for Lansmere."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON.&mdash;"Ha!&mdash;Lansmere! You will stand for Lansmere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (wincing).&mdash;"I propose to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON.&mdash;"I believe you will be opposed, subjected to even a sharp
      contest. Perhaps you may lose your election."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"If so, I resign myself, and you can foreclose on my
      estates."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON (his brow clearing).&mdash;"Look you, Egerton, I shall be too
      happy to do you a favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (with stateliness).&mdash;"Favour! No, Baron Levy, I ask from you
      no favour. Dismiss all thought of rendering me one. It is but a
      consideration of business on both sides. If you think it better that we
      shall at once settle our accounts, my lawyer shall investigate them. If
      you agree to the delay I request, my lawyer shall give you no trouble; and
      all that I have, except hope and character, pass to your hands without a
      struggle."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON.&mdash;"Inflexible and ungracious, favour or not&mdash;put it as
      you will&mdash;I accede, provided, first, that you allow me to draw up a
      fresh deed, which will accomplish your part of the compact; and secondly,
      that we saddle the proposed delay with the condition that you do not lose
      your election."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Agreed. Have you anything further to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON.&mdash;"Nothing, except that, if you require more money, I am
      still at your service."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"I thank you. No; I shall take the occasion of my
      retirement from office to reduce my establishment. I have calculated
      already, and provided for the expenditure I need, up to the date I have
      specified, and I shall have no occasion to touch the L5,000 that I still
      retain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your young friend, Mr. Leslie, ought to be very grateful to you," said
      the baron, rising. "I have met him in the world,&mdash;a lad of much
      promise and talent. You should try and get him also into parliament."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (thoughtfully).&mdash;"You are a good judge of the practical
      abilities and merits of men, as regards worldly success. Do you really
      think Randal Leslie calculated for public life&mdash;for a parliamentary
      career?"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON.&mdash;"Indeed I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (speaking more to himself than Levy).&mdash;"Parliament without
      fortune,&mdash;'t is a sharp trial; still he is prudent, abstemious,
      energetic, persevering; and at the onset, under my auspices and advice, he
      might establish a position beyond his years."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON. "It strikes me that we might possibly get him into the next
      parliament; or, as that is not likely to last long, at all events, into
      the parliament to follow,&mdash;not for one of the boroughs which will be
      swept away, but for a permanent seat, and without expense."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Ay,&mdash;and how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      THE BARON.&mdash;"Give me a few days to consider. An idea has occurred to
      me. I will call again if I find it practicable. Good-day to you, Egerton,
      and success to your election for Lansmere."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peschiera had not been so inactive as he had appeared to Harley and the
      reader. On the contrary, he had prepared the way for his ultimate design,
      with all the craft and the unscrupulous resolution which belonged to his
      nature. His object was to compel Riccabocca into assenting to the count's
      marriage with Violante, or, failing that, to ruin all chance of his
      kinsman's restoration. Quietly and secretly he had sought out, amongst the
      most needy and unprincipled of his own countrymen, those whom he could
      suborn to depose to Riccabocca's participation in plots and conspiracies
      against the Austrian dominion. These his former connection with the
      Carbonari enabled him to track to their refuge in London; and his
      knowledge of the characters he had to deal with fitted him well for the
      villanous task he undertook. He had, therefore, already selected out of
      these desperadoes a sufficient number either to serve as witnesses against
      his kinsman, or to aid him in any more audacious scheme which circumstance
      might suggest to his adoption. Meanwhile, he had (as Harley had suspected
      he would) set spies upon Randal's movements; and the day before that young
      traitor confided to him Violante's retreat, he had at least got scent of
      her father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery that Violante was under a roof so honoured, and seemingly so
      safe, as Lord Lansmere's, did not discourage this bold and desperate
      adventurer. We have seen him set forth to reconnoitre the house at
      Knightsbridge. He had examined it well, and discovered the quarter which
      he judged favourable to a coup-de-main, should that become necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lansmere's house and grounds were surrounded by a wall, the entrance
      being to the high-road, and by a porter's lodge. At the rear there lay
      fields crossed by a lane or byroad. To these fields a small door in the
      wall, which was used by the gardeners in passing to and from their work,
      gave communication. This door was usually kept locked; but the lock was of
      the rude and simple description common to such entrances, and easily
      opened by a skeleton key. So far there was no obstacle which Peschiera's
      experience in conspiracy and gallantry did not disdain as trivial. But the
      count was not disposed to abrupt and violent means in the first instance.
      He had a confidence in his personal gifts, in his address, in his previous
      triumphs over the sex, which made him naturally desire to hazard the
      effect of a personal interview; and on this he resolved with his wonted
      audacity. Randal's description of Violante's personal appearance, and such
      suggestions as to her character and the motives most likely to influence
      her actions as that young lynx-eyed observer could bestow, were all that
      the count required of present aid from his accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile we return to Violante herself. We see her now seated in the
      gardens at Knightsbridge, side by side with Helen. The place was retired,
      and out of sight from the windows of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"But why will you not tell me more of that early time? You
      are less communicative even than Leonard."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (looking down, and hesitatingly).&mdash;"Indeed there is nothing to
      tell you that you do not know; and it is so long since, and things are so
      changed now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of the last words was mournful, and the words ended with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE (with enthusiasm).&mdash;"How I envy you that past which you
      treat so lightly! To have been something, even in childhood, to the
      formation of a noble nature; to have borne on those slight shoulders half
      the load of a man's grand labour; and now to see Genius moving calm in its
      clear career; and to say inly, 'Of that genius I am a part!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (sadly and humbly).&mdash;"A part! Oh, no! A part? I don't
      understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"Take the child Beatrice from Dante's life, and should we
      have a Dante? What is a poet's genius but the voice of its emotions? All
      things in life and in Nature influence genius; but what influences it the
      most are its own sorrows and affections."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looks softly into Violante's eloquent face, and draws nearer to her
      in tender silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE (suddenly).&mdash;"Yes, Helen, yes,&mdash;I know by my own heart
      how to read yours. Such memories are ineffaceable. Few guess what strange
      self-weavers of our own destinies we women are in our veriest childhood!"
      She sunk her voice into a whisper: "How could Leonard fail to be dear to
      you,&mdash;dear as you to him,&mdash;dearer than all others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (shrinking back, and greatly disturbed).&mdash;"Hush, hush! you must
      not speak to me thus; it is wicked,&mdash;I cannot bear it. I would not
      have it be so; it must not be,&mdash;it cannot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands over her eyes for a moment, and then lifted her
      face, and the face was very sad, but very calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE (twining her arm round Helen's waist).&mdash;"How have I wounded
      you,&mdash;how offended? Forgive me, but why is this wicked? Why must it
      not be? Is it because he is below you in birth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"No, no,&mdash;I never thought of that. And what am I? Don't
      ask me,&mdash;I cannot answer. You are wrong, quite wrong as to me. I can
      only look on Leonard as&mdash;as a brother. But&mdash;but, you can speak
      to him more freely than I can. I would not have him waste his heart on me,
      nor yet think me unkind and distant, as I seem. I know not what I say. But&mdash;but&mdash;break
      to him&mdash;indirectly&mdash;gently&mdash;that duty in both forbids us
      both to&mdash;to be more than friends&mdash;than&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen, Helen!" cried Violante, in her warm, generous passion, "your heart
      betrays you in every word you say. You weep; lean on me, whisper to me;
      why&mdash;why is this? Do you fear that your guardian would not consent?
      He not consent? He who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"Cease&mdash;cease&mdash;cease!"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"What! You can fear Harley&mdash;Lord L'Estrange? Fie; you
      do not know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (rising suddenly).&mdash;"Violante, hold; I am engaged to another."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante rose also, and stood still, as if turned to stone; pale as death,
      till the blood came, at first slowly, then with suddenness from her heart,
      and one deep glow suffused her whole countenance. She caught Helen's hand
      firmly, and said in a hollow voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another! Engaged to another! One word, Helen,&mdash;not to him&mdash;not
      to&mdash;Harley&mdash;to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say,&mdash;I must not. I have promised," cried poor Helen, and
      as Violante let fall her hand, she hurried away. Violante sat down
      mechanically; she felt as if stunned by a mortal blow. She closed her eyes
      and breathed hard. A deadly faintness seized her; and when it passed away,
      it seemed to her as if she were no longer the same being, nor the world
      around her the same world,&mdash;as if she were but one sense of intense,
      hopeless misery, and as if the universe were but one inanimate void. So
      strangely immaterial are we really&mdash;we human beings, with flesh and
      blood&mdash;that if you suddenly abstract from us but single, impalpable,
      airy thought, which our souls have cherished, you seem to curdle the air,
      to extinguish the sun, to snap every link that connects us to matter, and
      to benumb everything into death, except woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this warm, young, southern nature but a moment before was so full of
      joy and life, and vigorous, lofty hope. It never till now had known its
      own intensity and depth. The virgin had never lifted the veil from her own
      soul of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, till then, had Harley L'Estrange been to Violante? An ideal, a dream
      of some imagined excellence, a type of poetry in the midst of the common
      world. It had not been Harley the man,&mdash;it had been Harley the
      Phantom. She had never said to herself, "He is identified with my love, my
      hopes, my home, my future." How could she? Of such he himself had never
      spoken; an internal voice, indeed, had vaguely, yet irresistibly,
      whispered to her that, despite his light words, his feelings towards her
      were grave and deep. O false voice! how it had deceived her! Her quick
      convictions seized the all that Helen had left unsaid. And now suddenly
      she felt what it is to love, and what it is to despair. So she sat,
      crushed and solitary, neither murmuring nor weeping, only now and then
      passing her hand across her brow, as if to clear away some cloud that
      would not be dispersed; or heaving a deep sigh, as if to throw off some
      load that no time henceforth could remove. There are certain moments in
      life in which we say to ourselves, "All is over; no matter what else
      changes, that which I have made my all is gone evermore&mdash;evermore!"
      And our own thought rings back in our ears, "Evermore&mdash;evermore!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Violante thus sat, a stranger, passing stealthily through the trees,
      stood between herself and the evening sun. She saw him not. He paused a
      moment, and then spoke low, in her native tongue, addressing her by the
      name which she had borne in Italy. He spoke as a relation, and excused his
      intrusion: "For," said he, "I come to suggest to the daughter the means by
      which she can restore to her father his country and his honours."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word "father" Violante roused herself, and all her love for that
      father rushed back upon her with double force. It does so ever,&mdash;we
      love most our parents at the moment when some tie less holy is abruptly
      broken; and when the conscience says, "There, at least, is a love that has
      never deceived thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw before her a man of mild aspect and princely form. Peschiera (for
      it was he) had banished from his dress, as from his countenance, all that
      betrayed the worldly levity of his character. He was acting a part, and he
      dressed and looked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father!" she said, quickly, and in Italian. "What of him? And who are
      you, signor? I know you not." Peschiera smiled benignly, and replied in a
      tone in which great respect was softened by a kind of parental tenderness,&mdash;"Suffer
      me to explain, and listen to me while I speak." Then, quietly seating
      himself on the bench beside her, he looked into her eyes, and resumed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless you have heard of the Count di Peschiera?"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"I heard that name, as a child, when in Italy. And when
      she with whom I then dwelt (my father's aunt) fell ill and died, I was
      told that my home in Italy was gone, that it had passed to the Count di
      Peschiera,&mdash;my father's foe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PESCHTERA.&mdash;"And your father, since then, has taught you to hate this
      fancied foe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"Nay, my father did but forbid me ever to breathe his
      name."
    </p>
    <p>
      PESCHIERA.&mdash;"Alas! what years of suffering and exile might have been
      saved your father, had he but been more just to his early friend and
      kinsman,&mdash;nay, had he but less cruelly concealed the secret of his
      retreat. Fair child, I am that Giulio Franzini, that Count di Peschiera. I
      am the man you have been told to regard as your father's foe. I am the man
      on whom the Austrian Emperor bestowed his lands. And now judge if I am, in
      truth, the foe. I have come hither to seek your father, in order to
      dispossess myself of my sovereign's gift. I have come but with one desire,&mdash;to
      restore Alphonso to his native land, and to surrender the heritage that
      was forced upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"My father, my dear father! His grand heart will have room
      once more. Oh, this is noble enmity, true revenge! I understand it,
      signor, and so will my father, for such would have been his revenge on
      you. You have seen him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PESCHIERA.&mdash;"No, not yet. I would not see him till I had seen
      yourself; for you, in truth, are the arbiter of his destinies, as of
      mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"I, Count? I&mdash;arbiter of my father's destinies? Is it
      possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      PESCHIERA (with a look of compassionate admiration, and in a tone yet more
      emphatically parental).&mdash;"How lovely is that innocent joy! But do not
      indulge it yet. Perhaps it is a sacrifice which is asked from you,&mdash;a
      sacrifice too hard to bear. Do not interrupt me. Listen still, and you
      will see why I could not speak to your father until I had obtained an
      interview with yourself. See why a word from you may continue still to
      banish me from his presence. You know, doubtless, that your father was one
      of the chiefs of a party that sought to free Northern Italy from the
      Austrians. I myself was at the onset a warm participator in that scheme.
      In a sudden moment I discovered that some of its more active projectors
      had coupled with a patriotic enterprise plots of a dark nature, and that
      the conspiracy itself was about to be betrayed to the government. I wished
      to consult with your father; but he was at a distance. I learned that his
      life was condemned. Not an hour was to be lost. I took a bold resolve,
      that has exposed me to his suspicions and to my country's wrath. But my
      main idea was to save him, my early friend, from death, and my country
      from fruitless massacre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I withdrew from the intended revolt. I sought at once the head of the
      Austrian government in Italy, and made terms for the lives of Alphonso and
      of the other more illustrious chiefs, which otherwise would have been
      forfeited. I obtained permission to undertake myself the charge of
      securing my kinsman in order to place him in safety, and to conduct him to
      a foreign land, in an exile that would cease when the danger was
      dispelled. But unhappily he deemed that I only sought to destroy him. He
      fled from my friendly pursuit. The soldiers with me were attacked by an
      intermeddling Englishman; your father escaped from Italy, concealing his
      retreat; and the character of his flight counteracted my efforts to obtain
      his pardon. The government conferred on me half his revenues, holding the
      other half at its pleasure. I accepted the offer in order to save his
      whole heritage from confiscation. That I did not convey to him what I
      pined to do,&mdash;namely, the information that I held but in trust what
      was bestowed by the government, and the full explanation of what seemed
      blamable in my conduct,&mdash;was necessarily owing to the secrecy he
      maintained. I could not discover his refuge; but I never ceased to plead
      for his recall. This year only I have partially succeeded. He can be
      restored to his heritage and rank, on one proviso,&mdash;a guarantee for
      his loyalty. That guarantee the government has named: it is the alliance
      of his only child with one whom the government can trust. It was the
      interest of all the Italian nobility that the representation of a House so
      great falling to a female should not pass away wholly from the direct
      line,&mdash;in a word, that you should ally yourself with a kinsman. But
      one kinsman, and he the next in blood, presented himself. In short,
      Alphonso regains all that he lost on the day in which his daughter gives
      her hand to Giulio Franzini, Count di Peschiera. Ah," continued the count,
      mournfully, "you shriek, you recoil. He thus submitted to your choice is
      indeed unworthy of you. You are scarce in the spring of life, he is in its
      waning autumn. Youth loves youth. He does not aspire to your love. All
      that he can say is, love is not the only joy of the heart,&mdash;it is joy
      to raise from ruin a beloved father; joy to restore, to a land poor in all
      but memories, a chief in whom it reverences a line of heroes. These are
      the joys I offer to you,&mdash;you, a daughter, and an Italian maid. Still
      silent? Oh, speak to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly this Count Peschiera knew well how woman is to be wooed and won;
      and never was woman more sensitive to those high appeals which most move
      all true earnest womanhood than was the young Violante. Fortune favoured
      him in the moment chosen. Harley was wrenched away from her hopes, and
      love a word erased from her language. In the void of the world, her
      father's image alone stood clear and visible. And she who from infancy had
      so pined to serve that father, who at first learned to dream of Harley as
      that father's friend! She could restore to him all for which the exile
      sighed; and by a sacrifice of self,&mdash;self-sacrifice, ever in itself
      such a temptation to the noble! Still, in the midst of the confusion and
      disturbance of her mind, the idea of marriage with another seemed so
      terrible and revolting, that she could not at once conceive it; and still
      that instinct of openness and honour, which pervaded all her character,
      warned even her inexperience that there was something wrong in this
      clandestine appeal to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the count besought her to speak, and with an effort she said,
      irresolutely,
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be as you say, it is not for me to answer you; it is for my
      father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," replied Peschiera. "Pardon, if I contradict you. Do you know so
      little of your father as to suppose that he will suffer his interest to
      dictate to his pride? He would refuse, perhaps, even to receive my visit,
      to hear my explanations; but certainly he would refuse to buy back his
      inheritance by the sacrifice of his daughter to one whom he has deemed his
      foe, and whom the mere disparity of years would incline the world to say
      he had made the barter of his personal ambition. But if I could go to him
      sanctioned by you; if I could say, 'Your daughter overlooks what the
      father might deem an obstacle,&mdash;she has consented to accept my hand
      of her own free choice, she unites her happiness, and blends her prayers
      with mine,'&mdash;then, indeed, I could not fail of success; and Italy
      would pardon my errors, and bless your name. Ah, Signorina, do not think
      of me save as an instrument towards the fulfilment of duties so high and
      sacred! think but of your ancestors, your father, your native land, and
      reject not the proud occasion to prove how you revere them all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante's heart was touched at the right chord. Her head rose, the colour
      came back to her pale cheek, she turned the glorious beauty of her
      countenance towards the wily tempter. She was about to answer and to seal
      her fate, when at that instant Harley's voice was heard at a little
      distance, and Nero came bounding towards her, and thrust himself, with
      rough familiarity, between her and Peschiera. The count drew back, and
      Violante, whose eyes were still fixed on his face, started at the change
      that passed there. One quick gleam of rage sufficed in an instant to light
      up the sinister secrets of his nature,&mdash;it was the face of the
      baffled gladiator. He had time but for few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must not be seen here," he muttered; "but to-morrow, in these gardens,
      about this hour. I implore you, for the sake of your father,&mdash;his
      hopes, fortunes, his very life,&mdash;to guard the secret of this
      interview,&mdash;to meet me again. Adieu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He vanished amidst the trees, and was gone,&mdash;noiselessly,
      mysteriously, as he had come.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last words of Peschiera were still ringing in Violante's ears when
      Harley appeared in sight, and the sound of his voice dispelled the vague
      and dreamy stupor which had crept over her senses. At that voice there
      returned the consciousness of a mighty loss, the sting of an intolerable
      anguish. To meet Harley there, and thus, seemed impossible. She turned
      abruptly away, and hurried towards the horse. Harley called to her by
      name, but she would not answer, and only quickened her steps. He paused a
      moment in surprise, and then hastened after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under what strange taboo am I placed?" said he, gayly, as he laid his
      hand on her shrinking arm. "I inquire for Helen,&mdash;she is ill, and
      cannot see me. I come to sun myself in your presence, and you fly me as if
      gods and men had set their mark on my brow. Child! child! what is this?
      You are weeping?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not stay me now,&mdash;do not speak to me," answered Violante, through
      her stifling sobs, as she broke from his hand and made towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you a grief, and under the shelter of my father's roof,&mdash;a
      grief that you will not tell to me? Cruel!" cried Harley, with
      inexpressible tenderness of reproach in his soft tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante could not trust herself to reply. Ashamed of her self-betrayal,
      softened yet more by his pleading voice, she could have prayed to the
      earth to swallow her. At length, checking her tears by an heroic effort,
      she said, almost calmly, "Noble friend, forgive me. I have no grief,
      believe me, which&mdash;which I can tell to you. I was but thinking of my
      poor father when you came up; alarming myself about him, it may be, with
      vain, superstitious fears; and so&mdash;even a slight surprise&mdash;your
      abrupt appearance has sufficed to make me thus weak and foolish; but I
      wish to see my father!&mdash;to go home&mdash;home!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father is well, believe me, and pleased that you are here. No danger
      threatens him; and you, here, are safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I safe&mdash;and from what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley mused irresolute. He inclined to confide to her the danger which
      her father had concealed; but had he the right to do so against her
      father's will?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me," he said, "time to reflect, and to obtain permission to intrust
      you with a secret which, in my judgment, you should know. Meanwhile, this
      much I may say, that rather than you should incur the danger that I
      believe he exaggerates, your father would have given you a protector&mdash;even
      in Randal Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," resumed Harley, with a calm, in which a certain deep mournfulness
      was apparent, unconsciously to himself, "but I trust you are reserved for
      a fairer fate, and a nobler spouse. I have vowed to live henceforth in the
      common workday world. But for you, bright child, for you, I am a dreamer
      still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante turned her eyes for one instant towards the melancholy speaker.
      The look thrilled to his heart. He bowed his face involuntarily. When he
      looked up, she had left his side. He did not this time attempt to follow
      her, but moved away and plunged amidst the leafless trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterwards he re-entered the house, and again sought to see Helen.
      She had now recovered sufficiently to give him the interview he requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached her with a grave and serious gentleness. "My dear Helen,"
      said he, "you have consented to be my wife, my life's mild companion; let
      it be soon&mdash;soon&mdash;for I need you. I need all the strength of
      that holy tie. Helen, let me press you to fix the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I owe you too much," answered Helen, looking down, "to have any will but
      yours. But your mother," she added, perhaps clinging to the idea of some
      reprieve,&mdash;"your mother has not yet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother&mdash;true. I will speak first to her. You shall receive from
      my family all honour due to your gentle virtues. Helen, by the way, have
      you mentioned to Violante the bond between us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that is, I fear I may have unguardedly betrayed it, against Lady
      Lansmere's commands too&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Lady Lansmere forbade you to name it to Violante? This should not be.
      I will answer for her permission to revoke that interdict. It is due to
      Violante and to you. Tell your young friend all. Ah, Helen, if I am at
      times cold or wayward, bear with me&mdash;bear with me; for you love me,
      do you not?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That same evening Randal heard from Levy (at whose house he stayed late)
      of that self-introduction to Violante which (thanks to his skeleton key)
      Peschiera had contrived to effect; and the count seemed more than
      sanguine,&mdash;he seemed assured as to the full and speedy success of his
      matrimonial enterprise. "Therefore," said Levy, "I trust I may very soon
      congratulate you on the acquisition of your family estates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange!" answered Randal, "strange that my fortunes seem so bound up
      with the fate of a foreigner like Beatrice di Negra and her connection
      with Frank Hazeldean." He looked up at the clock as he spoke, and added,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank by this time has told his father of his engagement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you feel sure that the squire cannot be coaxed into consent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but I feel sure that the squire will be so choleric at the first
      intelligence, that Frank will not have the self-control necessary for
      coaxing; and, perhaps, before the squire can relent upon this point, he
      may, by some accident, learn his grievances on another, which would
      exasperate him still more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, I understand,&mdash;the post-obit?" Randal nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what then?" asked Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next of kin to the lands of Hazeldean may have his day."
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have good prospects in that direction, Leslie; look now to another. I
      spoke to you of the borough of Lansmere. Your patron, Audley Egerton,
      intends to stand for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's heart had of late been so set upon other and more avaricious
      schemes, that a seat in parliament had sunk into a secondary object;
      nevertheless his ambitious and all-grasping nature felt a bitter pang,
      when he heard that Egerton thus interposed between himself and any chance
      of advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," he muttered sullenly,&mdash;"so this man, who pretends to be my
      benefactor, squanders away the wealth of my forefathers, throws me
      penniless on the world; and, while still encouraging me to exertion and
      public life, robs me himself of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" interrupted Levy, "not robs you; we may prevent that. The Lansmere
      interest is not so strong in the borough as Dick Avenel's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I cannot stand against Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly not,&mdash;you may stand with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dick Avenel will never suffer Egerton to come in; and though he cannot,
      perhaps, carry two of his own politics, he can split his votes upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's eyes flashed. He saw at a glance that if Avenel did not overrate
      the relative strength of parties, his seat could be secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," he said, "Egerton has not spoken to me on such a subject; nor can
      you expect that he would propose to me to stand with him, if he foresaw
      the chance of being ousted by the very candidate he himself introduced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither he nor his party will anticipate that possibility. If he ask you,
      agree to stand,&mdash;leave the rest to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must hate Egerton bitterly," said Randal; "for I am not vain enough
      to think that you thus scheme but from pure love to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The motives of men are intricate and complicated," answered Levy, with
      unusual seriousness. "It suffices to the wise to profit by the actions,
      and leave the motives in shade."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for some minutes. Then the two drew closer towards each
      other, and began to discuss details in their joint designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal walked home slowly. It was a cold moonlit night. Young idlers of
      his own years and rank passed him by on their way from the haunts of
      social pleasure. They were yet in the first fair holiday of life. Life's
      holiday had gone from him forever. Graver men, in the various callings of
      masculine labour&mdash;professions, trade, the State&mdash;passed him
      also. Their steps might be sober, and their faces careworn; but no step
      had the furtive stealth of his, no face the same contracted, sinister,
      suspicious gloom. Only once, in a lonely thoroughfare, and on the opposite
      side of the way, fell a footfall, and glanced an eye, that seemed to
      betray a soul in sympathy with Randal Leslie's.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Randal, who had heeded none of the other passengers by the way, as if
      instinctively, took note of this one. His nerves crisped at the noiseless
      slide of that form, as it stalked on from lamp to lamp, keeping pace with
      his own. He felt a sort of awe, as if he had beheld the wraith of himself;
      and even as he glanced suspiciously at the stranger, the stranger glanced
      at him. He was inexpressibly relieved when the figure turned down another
      street and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      That man was a felon, as yet undetected. Between him and his kind there
      stood but a thought,&mdash;a veil air-spun, but impassable, as the veil of
      the Image at Sais.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus moved and thus looked Randal Leslie, a thing of dark and secret
      mischief, within the pale of the law, but equally removed from man by the
      vague consciousness that at his heart lay that which the eyes of man would
      abhor and loathe. Solitary amidst the vast city, and on through the
      machinery of Civilization, went the still spirit of Intellectual Evil.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Randal received two notes, one from Frank, written
      in great agitation, begging Randal to see and propitiate his father, whom
      he feared he had grievously offended; and then running off, rather
      incoherently, into protestations that his honour as well as his affections
      were engaged irrevocably to Beatrice, and that her, at least, he could
      never abandon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the second note was from the squire himself&mdash;short, and far less
      cordial than usual&mdash;requesting Mr. Leslie to call on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal dressed in haste, and went first to Limmer's hotel. He found the
      parson with Mr. Hazeldean, and endeavouring in vain to soothe him. The
      squire had not slept all night, and his appearance was almost haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oho! Mr. young Leslie," said he, throwing himself back in his chair as
      Randal entered, "I thought you were a friend,&mdash;I thought you were
      Frank's adviser. Explain, sir! explain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gently, my dear Mr. Hazeldean," said the parson. "You do but surprise and
      alarm Mr. Leslie. Tell him more distinctly what he has to explain."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Did you or did you not tell me or Mrs. Hazeldean that Frank
      was in love with Violante Rickeybockey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (as in amaze).&mdash;"I! Never, sir! I feared, on the contrary,
      that he was somewhat enamoured of a very different person. I hinted at
      that possibility. I could not do more, for I did not know how far Frank's
      affections were seriously engaged. And indeed, sir, Mrs. Hazeldean, though
      not encouraging the idea that your son could marry a foreigner and a Roman
      Catholic, did not appear to consider such objections insuperable, if
      Frank's happiness were really at stake."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the poor squire gave way to a burst of passion, that involved in one
      tempest Frank, Randal, Harry herself, and the whole race of foreigners,
      Roman Catholics, and women. While the squire was still incapable of
      hearing reason, the parson, taking aside Randal, convinced himself that
      the whole affair, so far as Randal was concerned, had its origin in a very
      natural mistake; and that while that young gentleman had been hinting at
      Beatrice, Mrs. Hazeldean had been thinking of Violante. With considerable
      difficulty he succeeded in conveying this explanation to the squire, and
      somewhat appeasing his wrath against Randal. And the Dissimulator, seizing
      his occasion, then expressed so much grief and astonishment at learning
      that matters had gone as far as the parson informed him,&mdash;that Frank
      had actually proposed to Beatrice, been accepted, and engaged himself,
      before even communicating with his father; he declared so earnestly, that
      he could never conjecture such evil, that he had had Frank's positive
      promise to take no step without the sanction of his parents; he professed
      such sympathy with the squire's wounded feelings, and such regret at
      Frank's involvement, that Mr. Hazeldean at last yielded up his honest
      heart to his consoler, and griping Randal's hand, said, "Well, well, I
      wronged you; beg your pardon. What now is to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you cannot consent to this marriage,&mdash;impossible!" replied
      Randal; "and we must hope, therefore, to influence Frank by his sense of
      duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it," said the squire; "for I'll not give way. Pretty pass things
      have come to, indeed! A widow, too, I hear. Artful jade! thought, no
      doubt, to catch a Hazeldean of Hazeldean. My estates go to an outlandish
      Papistical set of mongrel brats! No, no, never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said the parson, mildly, "perhaps we may be unjustly prejudiced
      against this lady. We should have consented to Violante; why not to her?
      She is of good family?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And good character?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal shook his head, and sighed. The squire caught him roughly by the
      arm&mdash;"Answer the parson!" cried he, vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, sir, I cannot speak disrespectfully of the character of a woman,&mdash;who
      may, too, become Frank's wife; and the world is ill-natured and not to be
      believed. But you can judge for yourself, my dear Mr. Hazeldean. Ask your
      brother whether Madame di Negra is one whom he would advise his nephew to
      marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My brother!" exclaimed the squire, furiously. "Consult my distant brother
      on the affairs of my own son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a man of the world," put in Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And of feeling and honour," said the parson; "and, perhaps, through him,
      we may be enabled to enlighten Frank, and save him from what appears to be
      the snare of an artful woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meanwhile," said Randal, "I will seek Frank, and do my best with him. Let
      me go now,&mdash;I will return in an hour or so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will accompany you," said the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, pardon me, but I think we two young men can talk more openly without
      a third person, even so wise and kind as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let Randal go," growled the squire. And Randal went. He spent some time
      with Frank, and the reader will easily divine how that time was employed.
      As he left Frank's lodgings, he found himself suddenly seized by the
      squire himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was too impatient to stay at home and listen to the parson's prosing,"
      said Mr. Hazeldean, nervously. "I have shaken Dale off. Tell me what has
      passed. Oh, don't fear,&mdash;I'm a man, and can bear the worst."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal drew the squire's arm within his, and led him into the adjacent
      park.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir," said he, sorrowfully, "this is very confidential what I am
      about to say. I must repeat it to you, because, without such confidence, I
      see not how to advise you on the proper course to take. But if I betray
      Frank, it is for his good, and to his own father;&mdash;only do not tell
      him. He would never forgive me; it would forever destroy my influence over
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, go on," gasped the squire; "speak out. I'll never tell the
      ungrateful boy that I learned his secrets from another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Randal, "the secret of his entanglement with Madame di Negra
      is simply this: he found her in debt&mdash;nay, on the point of being
      arrested&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Debt! arrested! Jezebel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in paying the debt himself, and saving her from arrest, he conferred
      on her the obligation which no woman of honour could accept save from an
      affianced husband. Poor Frank!&mdash;if sadly taken in, still we must pity
      and forgive him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, to Randal's great surprise, the squire's whole face brightened
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see, I see!" he exclaimed, slapping his thigh. "I have it, I have it!
      'T is an affair of money! I can buy her off. If she took money from him&mdash;the
      mercenary, painted baggage I&mdash;why, then, she'll take it from me. I
      don't care what if costs&mdash;half my fortune&mdash;all! I'd be content
      never to see Hazeldean Hall again, if I could save my son, my own son,
      from disgrace and misery; for miserable he will be, when he knows he has
      broken my heart and his mother's. And for a creature like that! My boy, a
      thousand hearty thanks to you. Where does the wench live? I'll go to her
      at once." And as he spoke, the squire actually pulled out his pocketbook,
      and began turning over and counting the bank-notes in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal at first tried to combat this bold resolution on the part of the
      squire; but Mr. Hazeldean had seized on it with all the obstinacy of his
      straightforward English mind. He cut Randal's persuasive eloquence off in
      the midst.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't waste your breath! I've settled it; and if you don't tell me where
      she lives, 't is easily found out, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal mused a moment. "After all," thought he, "why not? He will be sure
      so to speak as to enlist her pride against himself, and to irritate Frank
      to the utmost. Let him go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly he gave the information required; and, insisting with great
      earnestness on the squire's promise not to mention to Madame di Negra his
      knowledge of Frank's pecuniary aid (for that would betray Randal as the
      informant); and satisfying himself as he best might with the squire's
      prompt assurance, "that he knew how to settle matters, without saying why
      or wherefore, as long as he opened his purse wide enough," he accompanied
      Mr. Hazeldean back into the streets, and there left him,&mdash;fixing an
      hour in the evening for an interview at Limmer's, and hinting that it
      would be best to have that interview without the presence of the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent good man," said Randal, "but not with sufficient knowledge of
      the world for affairs of this kind, which you understand so well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so," quoth the squire, who had quite recovered his
      good-humour. "And the parson is as soft as buttermilk. We must be firm
      here,&mdash;firm, sir." And the squire struck the end of his stick on the
      pavement, nodded to Randal, and went on to May Fair as sturdily and as
      confidently as if to purchase a prize cow at a cattle-show.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "Bring the light nearer," said John Burley,&mdash;"nearer still."
    </h3>
    <p>
      Leonard obeyed, and placed the candle on a little table by the sick man's
      bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley's mind was partially wandering; but there was method in his
      madness. Horace Walpole said that "his stomach would survive all the rest
      of him." That which in Burley survived the last was his quaint, wild
      genius. He looked wistfully at the still flame of the candle: "It lives
      ever in the air!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What lives ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Burley's voice swelled, "Light!" He turned from Leonard, and again
      contemplated the little flame. "In the fixed star, in the
      Will-o'-the-wisp, in the great sun that illumines half a world, or the
      farthing rushlight by which the ragged student strains his eyes,&mdash;still
      the same flower of the elements! Light in the universe, thought in the
      soul&mdash;Ay, ay, go on with the simile. My head swims. Extinguish the
      light! You cannot; fool, it vanishes from your eye, but it is still in the
      space. Worlds must perish, suns shrivel up, matter and spirit both fall
      into nothingness, before the combinations whose union makes that little
      flame which the breath of a babe can restore to darkness, shall lose the
      power to form themselves into light once more. Lose the power!&mdash;no,
      the necessity: it is the one Must in creation. Ay, ay, very dark riddles
      grow clear now,&mdash;now when I could not cast up an addition sum in the
      baker's bill! What wise man denied that two and two made four? Do they not
      make four? I can't answer him. But I could answer a question that some
      wise men have contrived to make much knottier." He smiled softly, and
      turned his face for some minutes to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the second night on which Leonard had watched by his bedside, and
      Burley's state had grown rapidly worse. He could not last many days,
      perhaps many hours. But he had evinced an emotion beyond mere delight at
      seeing Leonard again. He had since then been calmer, more himself. "I
      feared I might have ruined you by my bad example," he said, with a touch
      of humour that became pathos as he added, "That idea preyed on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; you did me great good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say that,&mdash;say it often," said Burley, earnestly; "it makes my heart
      feel so light."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had listened to Leonard's story with deep interest, and was fond of
      talking to him of little Helen. He detected the secret at the young man's
      heart, and cheered the hopes that lay there, amidst fears and sorrows.
      Burley never talked seriously of his repentance; it was not in his nature
      to talk seriously of the things which he felt solemnly. But his high
      animal spirits were quenched with the animal power that fed them. Now, we
      go out of our sensual existence only when we are no longer enthralled by
      the Present, in which the senses have their realm. The sensual being
      vanishes when Ave are in the Past or the Future. The Present was gone from
      Burley; he could no more be its slave and its king.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was most touching to see how the inner character of this man unfolded
      itself, as the leaves of the outer character fell off and withered,&mdash;a
      character no one would have guessed in him, an inherent refinement that
      was almost womanly; and he had all a woman's abnegation of self. He took
      the cares lavished on him so meekly. As the features of the old man return
      in the stillness of death to the aspect of youth,&mdash;the lines effaced,
      the wrinkles gone,&mdash;so, in seeing Burley now, you saw what he had
      been in his spring of promise. But he himself saw only what he had failed
      to be,&mdash;powers squandered, life wasted. "I once beheld," he said, "a
      ship in a storm. It was a cloudy, fitful day, and I could see the ship
      with all its masts fighting bard for life and for death. Then came night,
      dark as pitch, and I could only guess that the ship fought on. Towards the
      dawn the stars grew visible, and once more I saw the ship: it was a wreck,&mdash;it
      went down just as the stars shone forth."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had made that allusion to himself, he sat very still for some
      time, then he spread out his wasted hands, and gazed on them, and on his
      shrunken limbs. "Good," said he, laughing low; "these hands were too large
      and rude for handling the delicate webs of my own mechanism, and these
      strong limbs ran away with me. If I had been a sickly, puny fellow,
      perhaps my mind would have had fair play. There was too much of brute body
      here! Look at this hand now! You can see the light through it! Good,
      good!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, that evening, until he had retired to bed, Burley had been unusually
      cheerful, and had talked with much of his old eloquence, if with little of
      his old humour. Amongst other matters, he had spoken with considerable
      interest of some poems and other papers in manuscript which had been left
      in the house by a former lodger, and which, the reader may remember, Mrs.
      Goodyer had urged him in vain to read, in his last visit to her cottage.
      But then he had her husband Jacob to chat with, and the spirit bottle to
      finish, and the wild craving for excitement plucked his thoughts back to
      his London revels. Now poor Jacob was dead, and it was not brandy that the
      sick man drank from the widow's cruse; and London lay afar amidst its
      fogs, like a world resolved back into nebula. So, to please his hostess
      and distract his own solitary thoughts, he had condescended (just before
      Leonard found him out) to peruse the memorials of a life obscure to the
      world, and new to his own experience of coarse joys and woes. "I have been
      making a romance, to amuse myself, from their contents," said he. "They
      maybe of use to you, brother author. I have told Mrs. Goodyer to place
      them in your room. Amongst those papers is a sort of journal,&mdash;a
      woman's journal; it moved me greatly. A man gets into another world,
      strange to him as the orb of Sirius, if he can transport himself into the
      centre of a woman's heart, and see the life there, so wholly unlike our
      own. Things of moment to us, to it so trivial; things trifling to us, to
      it so vast. There was this journal, in its dates reminding me of stormy
      events in my own existence, and grand doings in the world's. And those
      dates there, chronicling but the mysterious, unrevealed record of some
      obscure, loving heart! And in that chronicle, O Sir Poet, there was as
      much genius, vigour of thought, vitality of being, poured and wasted, as
      ever kind friend will say was lavished on the rude outer world by big John
      Burley! Genius, genius! are we all alike, then, save when we leash
      ourselves to some matter-of-fact material, and float over the roaring seas
      on a wooden plank or a herring tub?" And after he had uttered that cry of
      a secret anguish, John Burley had begun to show symptoms of growing fever
      and disturbed brain; and when they had got him into bed, he lay there
      muttering to himself, until, towards midnight, he had asked Leonard to
      bring the light nearer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now he again was quiet, with his face turned towards the wall; and
      Leonard stood by the bedside sorrowfully, and Mrs. Goodyer, who did not
      heed Burley's talk, and thought only of his physical state, was dipping
      cloths into iced water to apply to his forehead. But as she approached
      with these, and addressed him soothingly, Burley raised himself on his
      arm, and waved aside the bandages. "I do not need them," said he, in a
      collected voice. "I am better now. I and that pleasant light understand
      one another, and I believe all it tells me. Pooh, pooh, I do not rave." He
      looked so smilingly and so kindly into her face, that the poor woman, who
      loved him as her own son, fairly burst into tears. He drew her towards
      him, and kissed her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace, old fool," said he, fondly. "You shall tell anglers hereafter how
      John Burley came to fish for the one-eyed perch which he never caught; and
      how, when he gave it up at the last, his baits all gone, and the line
      broken amongst the weeds, you comforted the baffled man. There are many
      good fellows yet in the world who will like to know that poor Burley did
      not die on a dunghill. Kiss me. Come, boy, you too. Now, God bless you, I
      should like to sleep." His cheeks were wet with the tears of both his
      listeners, and there was a moisture in his own eyes, which, nevertheless,
      beamed bright through the moisture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid himself down again, and the old woman would have withdrawn the
      light. He moved uneasily. "Not that," he murmured,&mdash;"light to the
      last!" and putting forth his wan hand, he drew aside the curtain so that
      the light might fall full on his face.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [Every one remembers that Goethe's last words are said to have been,
   "More Light;" and perhaps what has occurred in the text may be
   supposed a plagiarism from those words. But, in fact, nothing is
   more common than the craving and demand for light a little before
   death. Let any consult his own sad experience in the last moments
   of those whose gradual close he has watched and tended. What more
   frequent than a prayer to open the shutters and let in the sun?
   What complaint more repeated and more touching than "that it is
   growing dark"? I once knew a sufferer, who did not then seem in
   immediate danger, suddenly order the sick room to be lit up as if
   for a gala. When this was told to the physician, he said gravely,
   "No worse sign."]
</pre>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he was asleep, breathing calmly and regularly as an
      infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman wiped her eyes, and drew Leonard softly into the adjoining
      room, in which a bed had been made up for him. He had not left the house
      since he had entered it with Dr. Morgan. "You are young, sir," said she,
      with kindness, "and the young want sleep. Lie down a bit: I will call you
      when he wakes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I could not sleep," said Leonard. "I will watch for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman shook her head. "I must see the last of him, sir; but I know
      he will be angry when his eyes open on me, for he has grown very
      thoughtful of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, if he had but been, as thoughtful of himself!" murmured Leonard; and
      he seated himself by the table, on which, as he leaned his elbow, he
      dislodged some papers placed there. They fell to the ground with a dumb,
      moaning, sighing sound.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?" said he, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman picked up the manuscripts and smoothed them carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir, he bade me place these papers here. He thought they might keep
      you from fretting about him, in case you would sit up and wake. And he had
      a thought of me, too; for I have so pined to find out the poor young lady,
      who left them years ago. She was almost as dear to me as he is; dearer
      perhaps until now&mdash;when&mdash;when I am about to lose him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard turned from the papers, without a glance at their contents: they
      had no interest for him at such a moment. The hostess went on,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps she is gone to heaven before him; she did not look like one long
      for this world. She left us so suddenly. Many things of hers besides these
      papers are still, here; but I keep them aired and dusted, and strew
      lavender over them, in case she ever come for them again. You never heard
      tell of her, did you, sir?" she added, with great simplicity, and dropping
      a half courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of her&mdash;of whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did not Mr. John tell you her name&mdash;dear, dear; Mrs. Bertram."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard started; the very name so impressed upon his memory by Harley
      L'Estrange!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bertram!" he repeated. "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, sir! And many years after she had left us, and we had heard no
      more of her, there came a packet addressed to her here, from over sea,
      sir. We took it in, and kept it, and John would break the seal, to know if
      it would tell us anything about her; but it was all in a foreign language
      like,&mdash;we could not read a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you the packet? Pray show it to me. It may be of the greatest value.
      To-morrow will do&mdash;I cannot think of that just now. Poor Burley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard's manner indicated that he wished to talk no more, and to be
      alone. So Mrs. Goodyer left him, and stole back to Burley's room on
      tiptoe:
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man remained in deep revery for some moments. "Light," he
      murmured. "How often 'Light' is the last word of those round whom the
      shades are gathering!" He moved, and straight on his view through the
      cottage lattice there streamed light indeed,&mdash;not the miserable ray
      lit by a human hand, but the still and holy effulgence of a moonlit
      heaven. It lay broad upon the humble floors, pierced across the threshold
      of the death chamber, and halted clear amidst its shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard stood motionless, his eye following the silvery silent splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," he said inly&mdash;"and does this large erring nature, marred by
      its genial faults, this soul which should have filled a land, as yon orb
      the room, with a light that linked earth to heaven&mdash;does it pass away
      into the dark, and leave not a ray behind? Nay, if the elements of light
      are ever in the space, and when the flame goes out, return to the vital
      air, so thought once kindled lives forever around and about us, a part of
      our breathing atmosphere. Many a thinker, many a poet, may yet illumine
      the world, from the thoughts which yon genius, that will have no name,
      gave forth to wander through air, and recombine again in some new form of
      light."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he went on in vague speculations, seeking, as youth enamoured of fame
      seeks too fondly, to prove that mind never works, however erratically, in
      vain, and to retain yet, as an influence upon earth, the soul about to
      soar far beyond the atmosphere where the elements that make fame abide.
      Not thus had the dying man interpreted the endurance of light and thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, in the midst of his revery, a loud cry broke on his ear. He
      shuddered as he heard, and hastened forebodingly into the adjoining room.
      The old woman was kneeling by the bedside, and chafing Burley's hand,
      eagerly looking into his face. A glance sufficed to Leonard. All was over.
      Burley had died in sleep,&mdash;calmly, and without a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes were half open, with that look of inexpressible softness which
      death sometimes leaves; and still they were turned towards the light; and
      the light burned clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard closed tenderly the heavy lids; and as he covered the face, the
      lips smiled a serene farewell.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We have seen Squire Hazeldean (proud of the contents of his pocketbook,
      and his knowledge of the mercenary nature of foreign women) set off on his
      visit to Beatrice di Negra. Randal thus left, musing lone in the crowded
      streets, resolved with astute complacency the probable results of Mr.
      Hazeldean's bluff negotiation; and convincing himself that one of his
      vistas towards Fortune was becoming more clear and clear, he turned, with
      the restless activity of some founder of destined cities in a new
      settlement, to lop the boughs that cumbered and obscured the others. For
      truly, like a man in a vast Columbian forest, opening entangled space, now
      with the ready axe, now with the patient train that kindles the slower
      fire, this child of civilized life went toiling on against surrounding
      obstacles, resolute to destroy, but ever scheming to construct. And now
      Randal has reached Levy's dainty business-room, and is buried deep in
      discussion how to secure to himself, at the expense of his patron, the
      representation of Lansmere, and how to complete the contract which shall
      reannex to his forlorn inheritance some fragments of its ancient wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Chance fought on his side in the boudoir of May Fair. The
      squire had found the marchesa at home, briefly introduced himself and his
      business, told her she was mistaken if she had fancied she had taken in a
      rich heir in his son; that, thank Heaven, he could leave his estates to
      his ploughman, should he so please, but that he was willing to do things
      liberally; and whatever she thought Frank was worth, he was very ready to
      pay for.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time Beatrice would perhaps have laughed at this strange
      address; or she might, in some prouder moment, have fired up with all a
      patrician's resentment and a woman's pride; but now her spirit was
      crushed, her nerves shattered: the sense of her degraded position, of her
      dependence on her brother, combined with her supreme unhappiness at the
      loss of those dreams with which Leonard had for a while charmed her
      wearied waking life,&mdash;all came upon her. She listened; pale and
      speechless; and the poor squire thought he was quietly advancing towards a
      favourable result, when she suddenly burst into a passion of hysterical
      tears; and just at that moment Frank himself entered the room. At the
      sight of his father, of Beatrice's grief, his sense of filial duty gave
      way. He was maddened by irritation, by the insult offered to the woman he
      loved, which a few trembling words from her explained to him,&mdash;maddened
      yet more by the fear that the insult had lost her to him; warm words
      ensued between son and father, to close with the peremptory command and
      vehement threat of the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come away this instant, sir! Come with me, or before the day is over, I
      strike you out of my will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The son's answer was not to his father; he threw himself at Beatrice's
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive him; forgive us both&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you prefer that stranger to me,&mdash;to the inheritance of
      Hazeldean!" cried the squire, stamping his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave your estates to whom you will; all that I care for in life is
      here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire stood still a moment or so, gazing on his son with a strange
      bewildered marvel at the strength of that mystic passion, which none not
      labouring under its fearful charm can comprehend, which creates the sudden
      idol that no reason justifies, and sacrifices to its fatal shrine alike
      the Past and the Future. Not trusting himself to speak, the father drew
      his hand across his eyes, and dashed away the bitter tear that sprang from
      a swelling and indignant heart; then he uttered an inarticulate sound,
      and, finding his voice gone, moved away to the door, and left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked through the streets, bearing his head very erect, as a proud man
      does when deeply wounded, and striving to shake off some affection that he
      deems a weakness; and his trembling nervous fingers fumbled at the button
      of his coat, trying to tighten the garment across his chest, as if to
      confirm a resolution that still sought to struggle out of the revolting
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he went on, and the reader, perhaps, will wonder whither; and the
      wonder may not lessen when he finds the squire come to a dead pause in
      Grosvenor Square, and at the portico of his "distant brother's" stately
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the squire's brief inquiry whether Mr. Egerton was at home, the porter
      summoned the groom of the chambers; and the groom of the chambers, seeing
      a stranger, doubted whether his master was not engaged, but would take in
      the stranger's card and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay," muttered the squire, "this is true relationship!&mdash;my child
      prefers a stranger to me; why should I complain that I am a stranger in a
      brother's house? Sir," added the squire aloud, and very meekly&mdash;"sir,
      please to say to your master that I am William Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant bowed low, and without another word conducted the visitor into
      the statesman's library, and announcing Mr. Hazeldean, closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley was seated at his desk, the grim iron boxes still at his feet, but
      they were now closed and locked. And the ex-minister was no longer looking
      over official documents; letters spread open before him of far different
      nature; in his hand there lay a long lock of fair silken hair, on which
      his eyes were fixed sadly and intently. He started at the sound of his
      visitor's name, and the tread of the squire's stalwart footstep; and
      mechanically thrust into his bosom the relic of younger and warmer years,
      keeping his hand to his heart, which beat loud with disease under the
      light pressure of that golden hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers stood on the great man's lonely hearth, facing each other
      in silence, and noting unconsciously the change made in each during the
      long years in which they had never met.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, with his portly size, his hardy sunburned cheeks, the partial
      baldness of his unfurrowed open forehead, looked his full age,&mdash;deep
      into middle life. Unmistakably he seemed the pater familias, the husband
      and the father, the man of social domestic ties. But about Audley (really
      some few years junior to the squire), despite the lines of care on his
      handsome face, there still lingered the grace of youth. Men of cities
      retain youth longer than those of the country,&mdash;a remark which Buffon
      has not failed to make and to account for. Neither did Egerton betray the
      air of the married man; for ineffable solitariness seemed stamped upon one
      whose private life had long been so stern a solitude. No ray from the
      focus of Home played round that reserved, unjoyous, melancholy brow. In a
      word, Audley looked still the man for whom some young female heart might
      fondly sigh; and not the less because of the cold eye and compressed lip,
      which challenged interest even while seeming to repel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley was the first to speak, and to put forth the right hand, which he
      stole slowly from its place at his breast, on which the lock of hair still
      stirred to and fro at the heave of the labouring heart. "William," said
      he, with his rich deep voice, "this is kind. You are come to see me, now
      that men say that I am fallen. The minister you censured is no more; and
      you see again the brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire was softened at once by this address. He shook heartily the
      hand tendered to him; and then, turning away his head, with an honest
      conviction that Audley ascribed to him a credit which he did not deserve,
      he said, "No, no, Audley; I am more selfish than you think me. I have come&mdash;I
      have come to ask your advice,&mdash;no, not exactly that&mdash;your
      opinion. But you are busy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, William. Old days were coming over me when you entered; days
      earlier still return now,&mdash;days, too, that leave no shadow when their
      suns are set."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proud man seemed to think he had said too much. His practical nature
      rebuked the poetic sentiment and phrase. He re-collected himself, and
      added, more coldly, "You would ask my opinion? What on? Some public matter&mdash;some
      parliamentary bill that may affect your property?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I such a mean miser as that? Property&mdash;property? what does
      property matter, when a man is struck down at his own hearth? Property,
      indeed! But you have no child&mdash;happy brother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay; as you say, I am a happy man; childless! Has your son displeased
      you? I have heard him well spoken of, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk of him. Whether his conduct be good or ill is my affair,"
      resumed the poor father, with a testy voice&mdash;jealous alike of
      Audley's praise or blame of his rebellious son. Then he rose a moment, and
      made a strong gulp, as if for air; and laying his broad brown hand on his
      brother's shoulder, said, "Randal Leslie tells me you are wise,&mdash;a
      consummate man of the world. No doubt you are so. And Parson Dale tells me
      that he is sure you have warm feelings,&mdash;which I take to be a strange
      thing for one who has lived so long in London, and has no wife and no
      child, a widower, and a member of parliament,&mdash;for a commercial city,
      too. Never smile; it is no smiling matter with me. You know a foreign
      woman, called Negra or Negro; not a blackymoor, though, by any means,&mdash;at
      least on the outside of her. Is she such a woman as a plain country
      gentleman would like his only son to marry&mdash;ay or no?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed," answered Audley, gravely; "and I trust your son will commit
      no action so rash. Shall I see him, or her? Speak, my dear William. What
      would you have me do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing; you have said enough," replied the squire, gloomily; and his
      head sank on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley took his hand, and pressed it fraternally. "William," said the
      statesman, "we have been long estranged; but I do not forget that when we
      last met, at&mdash;at Lord Lansmere's house, and when I took you aside,
      and said, 'William, if I lose this election, I must resign all chance of
      public life; my affairs are embarrassed. I would not accept money from
      you,&mdash;I would seek a profession, and you can help me there,' you
      divined my meaning, and said, 'Take orders; the Hazeldean living is just
      vacant. I will get some one to hold it till you are ordained.' I do not
      forget that. Would that I had thought earlier of so serene an escape from
      all that then tormented me! My lot might have been far happier."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire eyed Audley with a surprise that broke forth from his more
      absorbing emotions. "Happier! Why, all things have prospered with you; and
      you are rich enough now; and&mdash;you shake your head. Brother, is it
      possible! do you want money? Pooh, not accept money from your mother's
      son!&mdash;stuff!" Out came the squire's pocketbook. Audley put it gently
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said he, "I have enough for myself; but since you seek and speak
      with me thus affectionately, I will ask you one favour. Should I die
      before I can provide for my wife's kinsman, Randal Leslie, as I could
      wish, will you see to his fortunes, so far as you can, without injury to
      others,&mdash;to your own son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son! He is provided for. He has the Casino estate&mdash;much good may
      it do him! You have touched on the very matter that brought me here. This
      boy, Randal Leslie, seems a praiseworthy lad, and has Hazeldean blood in
      his veins. You have taken him up because he is connected with your late
      wife. Why should I not take him up, too, when his grandmother was a
      Hazeldean? My main object in calling was to ask what you mean to do for
      him; for if you do not mean to provide for him, why, I will, as in duty
      bound. So your request comes at the right time; I think of altering my
      will. I can put him into the entail, besides a handsome legacy. You are
      sure he is a good lad,&mdash;and it will please you too, Audley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not at the expense of your son. And stay, William: as to this foolish
      marriage with Madame di Negra,&mdash;who told you Frank meant to take such
      a step?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He told me himself; but it is no matter. Randal and I both did all we
      could to dissuade him; and Randal advised me to come to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has acted generously, then, our kinsman Randal&mdash;I am glad to hear
      it," said Audley, his brow somewhat clearing. "I have no influence with
      this lady; but, at least, I can counsel her. Do not consider the marriage
      fixed because a young man desires it. Youth is ever hot and rash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your youth never was," retorted the squire, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You married well enough, I'm sure. I will say one thing for you: you have
      been, to my taste, a bad politician&mdash;beg pardon&mdash;but you were
      always a gentleman. You would never have disgraced your family and married
      a&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" interrupted Egerton, gently. "Do not make matters worse than they
      are. Madame di Negra is of high birth in her own country; and if scandal&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scandal!" cried the squire, shrinking, and turning pale. "Are you
      speaking of the wife of a Hazeldean? At least she shall never sit by the
      hearth at which now sits his mother; and whatever I may do for Frank, her
      children shall not succeed. No mongrel cross-breed shall kennel in English
      Hazeldean. Much obliged to you, Audley, for your good feeling; glad to
      have seen you; and hark ye, you startled me by that shake of your head,
      when I spoke of your wealth; and from what you say about Randal's
      prospects, I guess that you London gentlemen are not so thrifty as we are.
      You shall let me speak. I say again, that I have some thousands quite at
      your service. And though you are not a Hazeldean, still you are my
      mother's son; and now that I am about to alter my will, I can as well
      scratch in the name of Egerton as that of Leslie. Cheer up, cheer up: you
      are younger than I am, and you have no child; so you will live longer than
      I shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear brother," answered Audley, "believe me, I shall never live to
      want your aid. And as to Leslie, add to the L5,000 I mean to give him an
      equal sum in your will, and I shall feel that he has received justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing that the squire, though he listened attentively, made no ready
      answer, Audley turned the subject again to Frank; and with the adroitness
      of a man of the world, backed by cordial sympathy in his brother's
      distress, he pleaded so well Frank's lame cause, urged so gently the
      wisdom of patience and delay, and the appeal to filial feeling rather than
      recourse to paternal threats, that the squire grew mollified in spite of
      himself, and left his brother's house a much less angry and less doleful
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hazeldean was still in the Square, when he came upon Randal himself,
      who was walking with a dark-whiskered, showy gentleman, towards Egerton's
      house. Randal and the gentleman exchanged a hasty whisper, and the former
      then exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Mr. Hazeldean, have you just left your brother's house? Is it
      possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you advised me to go there, and I did. I scarcely knew what I was
      about. I am very glad I did go. Hang politics! hang the landed interest!
      what do I care for either now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foiled with Madame di Negra?" asked Randal, drawing the squire aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never speak of her again!" cried the squire, fiercely. "And as to that
      ungrateful boy&mdash;but I don't mean to behave harshly to him,&mdash;he
      shall have money enough to keep her if he likes, keep her from coming to
      me, keep him, too, from counting on my death, and borrowing post-obits on
      the Casino&mdash;for he'll be doing that next&mdash;no, I hope I wrong him
      there; I have been too good a father for him to count on my death already.
      After all," continued the squire, beginning to relax, "as Audley says, the
      marriage is not yet made; and if the woman has taken him in, he is young,
      and his heart is warm. Make yourself easy, my boy. I don't forget how
      kindly you took his part; and before I do anything rash, I'll at least
      consult with his poor mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal gnawed his pale lip, and a momentary cloud of disappointment passed
      over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, sir," said he, gently; "true, you must not be rash. Indeed, I was
      thinking of you and poor dear Frank at the very moment I met you. It
      occurred to me whether we might not make Frank's very embarrassments a
      reason to induce Madame di Negra to refuse him; and I was on my way to Mr.
      Egerton, in order to ask his opinion, in company with the gentleman
      yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentleman yonder. Why should he thrust his long nose into my family
      affairs? Who the devil is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ask, sir. Pray let me act."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the squire continued to eye askant the dark-whiskered personage thus
      interposed between himself and his son, and who waited patiently a few
      yards in the rear, carelessly readjusting the camellia in his button-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks very outlandish. Is he a foreigner too?" asked the squire at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not exactly. However, he knows all about Frank's embarrassments; and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Embarrassments! what, the debt he paid for that woman? How did he raise
      the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," answered Randal; "and that is the reason I asked Baron
      Levy to accompany me to Egerton's, that he might explain in private what I
      have no reason&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baron Levy!" interrupted the squire. "Levy, Levy&mdash;I have heard of a
      Levy who has nearly ruined my neighbour Thornhill,&mdash;a money-lender.
      Zounds! is that the man who knows my son's affairs? I'll soon learn, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal caught hold of the squire's arm: "Stop, stop; if you really insist
      upon learning more about Frank's debts, you must not appeal to Baron Levy
      directly, and as Frank's father: he will not answer you. But if I present
      you to him as a mere acquaintance of mine, and turn the conversation, as
      if carelessly, upon Frank, why, since, in the London world, such matters
      are never kept secret, except from the parents of young men, I have no
      doubt he will talk out openly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manage it as you will," said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal took Mr. Hazeldean's arm, and joined Levy&mdash;"A friend of mine
      from the country, Baron." Levy bowed profoundly, and the three walked
      slowly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the by," said Randal, pressing significantly upon Levy's arm, "my
      friend has come to town upon the somewhat unpleasant business of settling
      the debts of another,&mdash;a young man of fashion,&mdash;a relation of
      his own. No one, sir (turning to the squire), could so ably assist you in
      such arrangements as could Baron Levy."
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON (modestly, and with a moralizing air).&mdash;"I have some experience
      in such matters, and I hold it a duty to assist the parents and relations
      of young men who, from want of reflection, often ruin themselves for life.
      I hope the young gentleman in question is not in the hands of the Jews?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Christians are as fond of good interest for their money as
      ever the Jews can be."
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"Granted, but they have not always so much money to lend. The
      first thing, sir" (addressing the squire),&mdash;"the first thing for you
      to do is to buy up such of your relation's bills and notes of hand as may
      be in the market. No doubt we can get them a bargain, unless the young man
      is heir to some property that may soon be his in the course of nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Not soon&mdash;Heaven forbid! His father is still a young
      man,&mdash;a fine healthy man," leaning heavily on Levy's arm; "and as to
      post-obits&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"Post-obits on sound security cost more to buy up, however
      healthy the obstructing relative may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"I should hope that there are not many sons who can
      calculate, in cold blood, on the death of their fathers."
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"Ha, ha! He is young, our friend Randal; eh, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Well, I am not more scrupulous than others, I dare say; and
      I have often been pinched hard for money, but I would go barefoot rather
      than give security upon a father's grave! I can imagine nothing more
      likely to destroy natural feeling, nor to instil ingratitude and treachery
      into the whole character, than to press the hand of a parent, and
      calculate when that hand may be dust; than to sit down with strangers and
      reduce his life to the measure of an insurance-table; than to feel
      difficulties gathering round one, and mutter in fashionable slang, 'But it
      will be all well if the governor would but die.' And he who has accustomed
      himself to the relief of post-obits must gradually harden his mind to all
      this."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire groaned heavily; and had Randal proceeded another sentence in
      the same strain, the squire would have wept outright. "But," continued
      Randal, altering the tone of his voice, "I think that our young friend, of
      whom we were talking just now, Levy, before this gentleman joined us, has
      the same opinions as myself on this head. He may accept bills, but he
      would never sign post-obits."
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON (who, with the apt docility of a managed charger to the touch of a
      rider's hand, had comprehended and complied with each quick sign of
      Randal's).&mdash;"Pooh! the young fellow we are talking of? Nonsense. He
      would not be so foolish as to give five times the percentage he otherwise
      might. Not sign post-obits! Of course he has signed one."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Hist! you mistake, you mistake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE (leaving Randal's arm and seizing Levy's).&mdash;"Were you speaking
      of Frank Hazeldean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"My dear sir, excuse me, I never mention names before
      strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Strangers again! Man, I am the boy's father Speak out,
      sir," and his hand closed on Levy's arm with the strength of an iron vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"Gently; you hurt me, sir: but I excuse your feelings.
      Randal, you are to blame for leading me into this indiscretion; but I beg
      to assure Mr. Hazeldean, that though his son has been a little extravagant&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Owing chiefly to the arts of an abandoned woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"Of an abandoned woman;&mdash;still he has shown more
      prudence than you would suppose; and this very post-obit is a proof of it.
      A simple act of that kind has enabled him to pay off bills that were
      running on till they would have ruined even the Hazeldean estate; whereas
      a charge on the reversion of the Casino&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"He has done it then? He has signed a postobit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"No, no, Levy must be wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"My dear Leslie, a man of Mr. Hazeldean's time of life cannot
      have your romantic boyish notions. He must allow that Frank has acted in
      this like a lad of sense&mdash;very good head for business has my young
      friend Frank! And the best thing Mr. Hazeldean can do is quietly to buy up
      the post-obit, and thus he will place his son henceforth in his power."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Can I see the deed with my own eyes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"Certainly, or how could you be induced to buy it up? But on
      one condition; you must not betray me to your son. And, indeed, take my
      advice, and don't say a word to him on the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Let me see it, let me see it with my own eyes! His mother
      else will never believe it&mdash;nor will I."
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"I can call on you this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUIRE.&mdash;"Now, now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      BARON.&mdash;"You can spare me, Randal; and you yourself can open to Mr.
      Egerton the other affair respecting Lansmere. No time should be lost, lest
      L'Estrange suggest a candidate."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (whispering).&mdash;"Never mind me. This is more important."
      (Aloud)&mdash;"Go with Mr. Hazeldean. My dear kind friend" (to the
      squire), "do not let this vex you so much. After all, it is what nine
      young men out of ten would do in the same circumstances. And it is best
      you should know it; you may save Frank from further ruin, and prevent,
      perhaps, this very marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will see," exclaimed the squire, hastily. "Now, Mr. Levy, come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy and the squire walked on, not arm in arm, but side by side. Randal
      proceeded to Egerton's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to see you, Leslie," said the ex-minister. "What is it I have
      heard? My nephew, Frank Hazeldean, proposes to marry Madame di Negra
      against his father's consent? How could you suffer him to entertain an
      idea so wild? And how never confide it to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"My dear Mr. Egerton, it is only to-day that I was informed
      of Frank's engagement. I have already seen him, and expostulated in vain;
      till then, though I knew your nephew admired Madame di Negra, I could
      never suppose he harboured a serious intention."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"I must believe you, Randal. I will myself see Madame di
      Negra, though I have no power, and no right, to dictate to her. I have but
      little time for all such private business. The dissolution of parliament
      is so close at hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (looking down).&mdash;"It is on that subject that I wished to speak
      to you, sir. You think of standing for Lansmere. Well, Baron Levy has
      suggested to me an idea that I could not, of course, even countenance,
      till I had spoken to you. It seems that he has some acquaintance with the
      state of parties in that borough. He is informed that it is not only as
      easy to bring in two of our side as to carry one, but that it would make
      your election still more safe not to fight single-handed against two
      opponents; that if canvassing for yourself alone, you could not carry a
      sufficient number of plumper votes; that split votes would go from you to
      one or other of the two adversaries; that, in a word, it is necessary to
      pair you with a colleague. If it really be so, you of course will learn
      best from your own Committee; but should they concur in the opinion Baron
      Levy has formed, do I presume too much on your kindness to deem it
      possible that you might allow me to be the second candidate on your side?
      I should not say this, but that Levy told me you had some wish to see me
      in parliament, amongst the supporters of your policy. And what other
      opportunity can occur? Here the cost of carrying two would be scarcely
      more than that of carrying one. And Levy says the party would subscribe
      for my election; you, of course, would refuse all such aid for your own;
      and indeed, with your great name, and Lord Lansmere's interest, there can
      be little beyond the strict legal expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Randal spoke thus at length, he watched anxiously his patron's
      reserved, unrevealing countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (dryly).&mdash;"I will consider. You may safely leave in my hands
      any matter connected with your ambition and advancement. I have before
      told you I hold it a duty to do all in my power for the kinsman of my late
      wife, for one whose career I undertook to forward, for one whom honour has
      compelled to share in my own political reverses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Egerton rang the bell for his hat and gloves, and walking into the
      hall, paused at the street door. There beckoning to Randal, he said,
      slowly, "You seem intimate with Baron Levy; I caution you against him,&mdash;a
      dangerous acquaintance, first to the purse, next to the honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"I know it, sir; and am surprised myself at the acquaintance
      that has grown up between us. Perhaps its cause is in his respect for
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Tut."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Whatever it be, he contrives to obtain a singular hold over
      one's mind, even where, as in my case, he has no evident interest to
      serve. How is this? It puzzles me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"For his interest, it is most secured where he suffers it
      to be least evident; for his hold over the mind, it is easily accounted
      for. He ever appeals to two temptations, strong with all men,&mdash;Avarice
      and Ambition. Good-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Are you going to Madame di Negra's? Shall I not accompany
      you? Perhaps I may be able to back your own remonstrances."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"No, I shall not require you."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"I trust I shall hear the result of your interview? I feel
      so much interested in it. Poor Frank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley nodded. "Of course, of course."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On entering the drawing-room of Madame di Negra, the peculiar charm which
      the severe Audley Egerton had been ever reputed to possess with women
      would have sensibly struck one who had hitherto seen him chiefly in his
      relations with men in the business-like affairs of life. It was a charm in
      strong contrast to the ordinary manners of those who are emphatically
      called "Ladies' men." No artificial smile, no conventional, hollow
      blandness, no frivolous gossip, no varnish either of ungenial gayety or
      affected grace. The charm was in a simplicity that unbent more into
      kindness than it did with men. Audley's nature, whatever its faults and
      defects, was essentially masculine; and it was the sense of masculine
      power that gave to his voice a music when addressing the gentler sex, and
      to his manner a sort of indulgent tenderness that appeared equally void of
      insincerity and presumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank had been gone about half-an-hour, and Madame di Negra was scarcely
      recovered from the agitation into which she had been thrown by the affront
      from the father and the pleading of the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton took her passive hand cordially, and seated himself by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear marchesa," I said he, "are we then likely to be near connections?
      And can you seriously contemplate marriage with my young nephew, Frank
      Hazeldean? You turn away. Ah, my fair friend, there are but two
      inducements to a free woman to sign away her liberty at the altar. I say a
      free woman, for widows are free, and girls are not. These inducements are,
      first, worldly position; secondly, love. Which of these motives can urge
      Madame di Negra to marry Mr. Frank Hazeldeani?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are other motives than those you speak of,&mdash;the need of
      protection, the sense of solitude, the curse of dependence, gratitude for
      honourable affection. But you men never know women!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I grant that you are right there,&mdash;we never do; neither do women
      ever know men. And yet each sex contrives to dupe and to fool the other!
      Listen to me. I have little acquaintance with my nephew, but I allow he is
      a handsome young gentleman, with whom a handsome young lady in her teens
      might fall in love in a ball-room. But you, who have known the higher
      order of our species, you who have received the homage of men, whose
      thoughts and mind leave the small talk of drawing-room triflers so poor
      and bald, you cannot look me in the face and say that it is any passion
      resembling love which you feel for my nephew. And as to position, it is
      right that I should inform you that if he marry you he will have none. He
      may risk his inheritance. You will receive no countenance from his
      parents. You will be poor, but not free. You will not gain the
      independence you seek for. The sight of a vacant, discontented face in
      that opposite chair will be worse than solitude. And as to grateful
      affection," added the man of the world, "it is a polite synonym for
      tranquil indifference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Egerton," said Beatrice, "people say you are made of bronze. Did you
      ever feel the want of a home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I answer you frankly," replied the statesman, "if I had not felt it, do
      you think I should have been, and that I should be to the last, the
      joyless drudge of public life? Bronze though you call my nature, it would
      have melted away long since like wax in the fire, if I had sat idly down
      and dreamed of a home!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we women," answered Beatrice, with pathos, "have no public life, and
      we do idly sit down and dream. Oh," she continued, after a short pause,
      and clasping her hands firmly together, "you think me worldly, grasping,
      ambitious; how different my fate had been had I known a home!&mdash;known
      one whom I could love and venerate; known one whose smiles would have
      developed the good that was once within me, and the fear of whose rebuking
      or sorrowful eye would have corrected what is evil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet," answered Audley, "nearly all women in the great world have had that
      choice once in their lives, and nearly all have thrown it away. How few of
      your rank really think of home when they marry! how few ask to venerate as
      well as to love! and how many, of every rank, when the home has been
      really gained, have wilfully lost its shelter,&mdash;some in neglectful
      weariness, some from a momentary doubt, distrust, caprice, a wild fancy, a
      passionate fit, a trifle, a straw, a dream! True, you women are ever
      dreamers. Commonsense, common earth, is above or below your
      comprehension."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both now are silent. Audley first roused himself with a quick, writhing
      movement. "We two," said he, smiling half sadly, half cynically,&mdash;"we
      two must not longer waste time in talking sentiment. We know both too well
      what life, as it has been made for us by our faults or our misfortunes,
      truly is. And once again, I entreat you to pause before you yield to the
      foolish suit of my foolish nephew. Rely on it, you will either command a
      higher offer for your prudence to accept; or, if you needs must sacrifice
      rank and fortune, you, with your beauty and your romantic heart, will see
      one who, at least for a fair holiday season (if human love allows no
      more), can repay you for the sacrifice. Frank Hazeldean never can."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice turned away to conceal the tears that rushed to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think over this well," said Audley, in the softest tones of his mellow
      voice. "Do you remember that when you first came to England, I told you
      that neither wedlock nor love had any lures for me? We grew friends upon
      that rude avowal, and therefore I now speak to you like some sage of old,
      wise because standing apart and aloof from all the affections and ties
      that mislead our wisdom. Nothing but real love&mdash;how rare it is; has
      one human heart in a million ever known it?&mdash;nothing but real love
      can repay us for the loss of freedom, the cares and fears of poverty, the
      cold pity of the world that we both despise and respect. And all these,
      and much more, follow the step you would inconsiderately take, an
      imprudent marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Audley Egerton," said Beatrice, lifting her dark, moistened eyes, "you
      grant that real love does compensate for an imprudent marriage. You speak
      as if you had known such love&mdash;you! Can it be possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Real love&mdash;I thought that I knew it once. Looking back with remorse,
      I should doubt it now but for one curse that only real love, when lost,
      has the power to leave evermore behind it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A void here," answered Egerton, striking his heart. "Desolation!&mdash;Adieu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it," murmured Egerton, as he pursued his way through the streets&mdash;"is
      it that, as we approach death, all the first fair feelings of young life
      come back to us mysteriously? Thus I have heard, or read, that in some
      country of old, children scattering flowers preceded a funeral bier."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And so Leonard stood beside his friend's mortal clay, and watched, in the
      ineffable smile of death, the last gleam which the soul had left there;
      and so, after a time, he crept back to the adjoining room with a step as
      noiseless as if he had feared to disturb the dead. Wearied as he was with
      watching, he had no thought of sleep. He sat himself down by the little
      table, and leaned his face on his hand, musing sorrowfully. Thus time
      passed. He heard the clock from below strike the hours. In the house of
      death the sound of a clock becomes so solemn. The soul that we miss has
      gone so far beyond the reach of time! A cold, superstitious awe gradually
      stole over the young man. He shivered, and lifted his eyes with a start,
      half scornful, half defying. The moon was gone; the gray, comfortless dawn
      gleamed through the casement, and carried its raw, chilling light through
      the open doorway into the death-room. And there, near the extinguished
      fire, Leonard saw the solitary woman, weeping low; and watching still. He
      returned to say a word of comfort; she pressed his hand, but waved him
      away. He understood. She did not wish for other comfort than her quiet
      relief of tears. Again, he returned to his own chamber, and his eye this
      time fell upon the papers which he had hitherto disregarded. What made his
      heart stand still, and the blood then rush so quickly through his veins?
      Why did he seize upon those papers with so tremulous a hand, then lay them
      down, pause, as if to nerve himself, and look so eagerly again? He
      recognized the handwriting,&mdash;those fair, clear characters, so
      peculiar in their woman-like delicacy and grace, the same as in the wild,
      pathetic poems, the sight of which had made an era in his boyhood. From
      these pages the image of the mysterious Nora rose once more before him. He
      felt that he was with a mother. He went back, and closed the door gently,
      as if with a jealous piety, to exclude each ruder shadow from the world of
      spirits, and be alone with that mournful ghost. For a thought written in
      warm, sunny life, and then suddenly rising up to us, when the hand that
      traced and the heart that cherished it are dust, is verily as a ghost. It
      is a likeness struck off of the fond human being, and surviving it. Far
      more truthful than bust or portrait, it bids us see the tear flow, and the
      pulse beat. What ghost can the churchyard yield to us like the writing of
      the dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      The bulk of the papers had been once lightly sewn to each other; they had
      come undone, perhaps in Burley's rude hands, but their order was easily
      apparent. Leonard soon saw that they formed a kind of journal,&mdash;not,
      indeed, a regular diary, nor always relating to the things of the day.
      There were gaps in time&mdash;no attempt at successive narrative;
      sometimes, instead of prose, a hasty burst of verse, gushing evidently
      from the heart; sometimes all narrative was left untold, and yet, as it
      were, epitomized by a single burning line&mdash;a single exclamation&mdash;of
      woe or joy! Everywhere you saw records of a nature exquisitely
      susceptible; and, where genius appeared, it was so artless, that you did
      not call it genius, but emotion. At the onset the writer did not speak of
      herself in the first person. The manuscript opened with descriptions and
      short dialogues, carried on by persons to whose names only initial letters
      were assigned, all written in a style of simple innocent freshness, and
      breathing of purity and happiness, like a dawn of spring. Two young
      persons, humbly born, a youth and a girl, the last still in childhood,
      each chiefly self-taught, are wandering on Sabbath evenings among green
      dewy fields, near the busy town, in which labour awhile is still. Few
      words pass between them. You see at once, though the writer does not mean
      to convey it, how far beyond the scope of her male companion flies the
      heavenward imagination of the girl. It is he who questions, it is she who
      answers; and soon there steals upon you, as you read, the conviction that
      the youth loves the girl, and loves in vain. All in this writing, though
      terse, is so truthful! Leonard, in the youth, already recognizes the rude
      imperfect scholar, the village bard, Mark Fairfield. Then there is a gap
      in description; but there are short weighty sentences, which show
      deepening thought, increasing years, in the writer. And though the
      innocence remains, the happiness begins to be less vivid on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, insensibly, Leonard finds that there is a new phase in the writer's
      existence. Scenes no longer of humble, workday rural life surround her,
      and a fairer and more dazzling image succeeds to the companion of the
      Sabbath eves. This image Nora evidently loves to paint,&mdash;it is akin
      to her own genius; it captivates her fancy; it is an image that she
      (inborn artist, and conscious of her art) feels to belong to a brighter
      and higher school of the Beautiful. And yet the virgin's heart is not
      awakened,&mdash;no trace of the heart yet there! The new image thus
      introduced is one of her own years, perhaps; nay, it may be younger still,
      for it is a boy that is described, with his profuse fair curls, and eyes
      new to grief, and confronting the sun as a young eagle's; with veins so
      full of the wine of life, that they overflow into every joyous whim; with
      nerves quiveringly alive to the desire of glory; with the frank generous
      nature, rash in its laughing scorn of the world, which it has not tried.
      Who was this boy? it perplexed Leonard. He feared to guess. Soon, less
      told than implied, you saw that this companionship, however it chanced,
      brings fear and pain on the writer. Again (as before, with Mark
      Fairfield), there is love on the one side and not on the other; with her
      there is affectionate, almost sisterly, interest, admiration, gratitude,
      but a something of pride or of terror that keeps back love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Leonard's interest grew intense. Were there touches by which
      conjecture grew certainty; and he recognized, through the lapse of years,
      the boy-lover in his own generous benefactor?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fragments of dialogue now began to reveal the suit of an ardent,
      impassioned nature, and the simple wonder and strange alarm of a listener
      who pitied but could not sympathize. Some great worldly distinction of
      rank between the two became visible,&mdash;that distinction seemed to arm
      the virtue and steel the affections of the lowlier born. Then a few
      sentences, half blotted out with tears, told of wounded and humbled
      feelings,&mdash;some one invested with authority, as if the suitor's
      parent, had interfered, questioned, reproached, counselled. And it was
      evident that the suit was not one that dishonoured; it wooed to flight,
      but still to marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now these sentences grew briefer still, as with the decision of a
      strong resolve. And to these there followed a passage so exquisite, that
      Leonard wept unconsciously as he read. It was the description of a visit
      spent at home previous to some sorrowful departure. He caught the glimpse
      of a proud and vain, but a tender wistful mother, of a father's fonder but
      less thoughtful love. And then came a quiet soothing scene between the
      girl and her first village lover, ending thus: "So she put M.'s hand into
      her sister's, and said, 'You loved me through the fancy, love her with the
      heart,' and left them comprehending each other, and betrothed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard sighed. He understood now how Mark Fairfield saw, in the homely
      features of his unlettered wife, the reflection of the sister's soul and
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words told the final parting,&mdash;words that were a picture. The
      long friendless highway, stretching on&mdash;on&mdash;towards the
      remorseless city, and the doors of home opening on the desolate
      thoroughfare, and the old pollard-tree beside the threshold, with the
      ravens wheeling round it and calling to their young. He too had watched
      that threshold from the same desolate thoroughfare. He too had heard the
      cry of the ravens. Then came some pages covered with snatches of
      melancholy verse, or some reflections of dreamy gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer was in London, in the house of some high-born patroness,&mdash;that
      friendless shadow of a friend which the jargon of society calls
      "companion." And she was looking on the bright storm of the world as
      through prison bars. Poor bird, afar from the greenwood, she had need of
      song,&mdash;it was her last link with freedom and nature. The patroness
      seems to share in her apprehensions of the boy suitor, whose wild rash
      prayers the fugitive had resisted; but to fear lest the suitor should be
      degraded, not the one whom he pursues,&mdash;fear an alliance ill-suited
      to a high-born heir. And this kind of fear stings the writer's pride, and
      she grows harsh in her judgment of him who thus causes but pain where he
      proffers love. Then there is a reference to some applicant for her hand,
      who is pressed upon her choice; and she is told that it is her duty so to
      choose, and thus deliver a noble family from a dread that endures so long
      as her hand is free. And of this fear, and of this applicant, there breaks
      out a petulant yet pathetic scorn. After this the narrative, to judge by
      the dates, pauses for days and weeks, as if the writer had grown weary and
      listless,&mdash;suddenly to reopen in a new strain, eloquent with hopes
      and with fears never known before. The first person was abruptly assumed,&mdash;it
      was the living "I" that now breathed and moved along the lines. How was
      this? The woman was no more a shadow and a secret unknown to herself. She
      had assumed the intense and vivid sense of individual being; and love
      spoke loud in the awakened human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      A personage not seen till then appeared on the page. And ever afterwards
      this personage was only named as "He," as if the one and sole
      representative of all the myriads that walk the earth. The first notice of
      this prominent character on the scene showed the restless, agitated effect
      produced on the writer's imagination. He was invested with a romance
      probably not his own. He was described in contrast to the brilliant boy
      whose suit she had feared, pitied, and now sought to shun,&mdash;described
      with a grave and serious, but gentle mien, a voice that imposed respect,
      an eye and lip that showed collected dignity of will. Alas? the writer
      betrayed herself, and the charm was in the contrast, not to the character
      of the earlier lover, but her own. And now, leaving Leonard to explore and
      guess his way through the gaps and chasms of the narrative, it is time to
      place before the reader what the narrative alone will not reveal to
      Leonard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nora Avenel had fled from the boyish love of Harley L'Estrange,
      recommended by Lady Lansmere to a valetudinarian relative of her own, Lady
      Jane Horton, as companion. But Lady Lansmere could not believe it possible
      that the lowborn girl could long sustain her generous pride, and reject
      the ardent suit of one who could offer to her the prospective coronet of a
      countess. She continually urged upon Lady Jane the necessity of marrying
      Nora to some one of rank less disproportioned to her own, and empowered
      that lady to assure any such wooer of a dowry far beyond Nora's station.
      Lady Jane looked around, and saw in the outskirts of her limited social
      ring a young solicitor, a peer's natural son, who was on terms of more
      than business-like intimacy with the fashionable clients whose distresses
      made the origin of his wealth. The young man was handsome, well-dressed,
      and bland. Lady Jane invited him to her house; and, seeing him struck with
      the rare loveliness of Nora, whispered the hint of the dower. The
      fashionable solicitor, who afterwards ripened into Baron Levy, did not
      need that hint; for, though then poor, he relied on himself for fortune,
      and, unlike Randal, he had warm blood in his veins. But Lady Jane's
      suggestions made him sanguine of success; and when he formally proposed,
      and was as formally refused, his self-love was bitterly wounded. Vanity in
      Levy was a powerful passion; and with the vain, hatred is strong, revenge
      is rankling. Levy retired, concealing his rage; nor did he himself know
      how vindictive that rage, when it cooled into malignancy, could become,
      until the arch-fiend OPPORTUNITY prompted its indulgence and suggested its
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane was at first very angry with Nora for the rejection of a suitor
      whom she had presented as eligible. But the pathetic grace of this
      wonderful girl had crept into her heart, and softened it even against
      family prejudice; and she gradually owned to herself that Nora was worthy
      of some one better than Mr. Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Harley had ever believed that Nora returned his love, and that
      nothing but her own sense of gratitude to his parents, her own instincts
      of delicacy, made her deaf to his prayers. To do him justice, wild and
      headstrong as he then was, his suit would have ceased at once had he
      really deemed it persecution. Nor was his error unnatural; for his
      conversation, till it had revealed his own heart, could not fail to have
      dazzled and delighted the child of genius; and her frank eyes would have
      shown the delight. How, at his age, could he see the distinction between
      the Poetess and the Woman? The poetess was charmed with rare promise in a
      soul of which the very errors were the extravagances of richness and
      beauty. But the woman&mdash;no! the woman required some nature not yet
      undeveloped, and all at turbulent, if brilliant, strife with its own noble
      elements, but a nature formed and full-grown. Harley was a boy, and Nora
      was one of those women who must find or fancy an Ideal that commands and
      almost awes them into love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley discovered, not without difficulty, Nora's new residence. He
      presented himself at Lady Jane's, and she, with grave rebuke, forbade him
      the house. He found it impossible to obtain an interview with Nora. He
      wrote, but he felt sure that his letters never reached her, since they
      were unanswered. His young heart swelled with rage. He dropped threats,
      which alarmed all the fears of Lady Lansmere, and even the prudent
      apprehensions of his friend, Audley Egerton. At the request of the mother,
      and equally at the wish of the son, Audley consented to visit at Lady
      Jane's, and make acquaintance with Nora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have such confidence in you," said Lady Lansmere, "that if you once
      know the girl, your advice will be sure to have weight with her. You will
      show her how wicked it would be to let Harley break our hearts and degrade
      his station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have such confidence in you," said young Harley, "that if you once know
      my Nora, you will no longer side with my mother. You will recognize the
      nobility which nature only can create, you will own that Nora is worthy a
      rank more lofty than mine; and my mother so believes in your wisdom, that,
      if you plead in my cause, you will convince even her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley listened to both with his intelligent, half-incredulous smile; and
      wholly of the same opinion as Lady Lansmere, and sincerely anxious to save
      Harley from an indiscretion that his own notions led him to regard as
      fatal, he resolved to examine this boasted pearl, and to find out its
      flaws. Audley Egerton was then in the prime of his earnest, resolute,
      ambitious youth. The stateliness of his natural manners had then a suavity
      and polish which, even in later and busier life, it never wholly lost;
      since, in spite of the briefer words and the colder looks by which care
      and power mark the official man, the minister had ever enjoyed that
      personal popularity which the indefinable, external something, that wins
      and pleases, can alone confer. But he had even then, as ever, that
      felicitous reserve which Rochefoucauld has called the "mystery of the
      body,"&mdash;that thin yet guardian veil which reveals but the strong
      outlines of character, and excites so much of interest by provoking so
      much of conjecture. To the man who is born with this reserve, which is
      wholly distinct from shyness, the world gives credit for qualities and
      talents beyond those that it perceives; and such characters are attractive
      to others in proportion as these last are gifted with the imagination
      which loves to divine the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first interview, the impression which this man produced upon Nora
      Avenel was profound and strange. She had heard of him before as the one.
      whom Harley most loved and looked up to; and she recognized at once in his
      mien, his aspect, his words, the very tone of his deep tranquil voice, the
      power to which woman, whatever her intellect, never attains; and to which,
      therefore, she imputes a nobility not always genuine,&mdash;namely, the
      power of deliberate purpose and self-collected, serene ambition. The
      effect that Nora produced on Egerton was not less sudden. He was startled
      by a beauty of face and form that belonged to that rarest order, which we
      never behold but once or twice in our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was yet more amazed to discover that the aristocracy of mind could
      bestow a grace that no aristocracy of birth could surpass. He was prepared
      for a simple, blushing village girl, and involuntarily he bowed low his
      proud front at the first sight of that delicate bloom, and that exquisite
      gentleness which is woman's surest passport to the respect of man. Neither
      in the first, nor the second, nor the third interview, nor, indeed, till
      after many interviews, could he summon up courage to commence his mission,
      and allude to Harley. And when he did so at last his words faltered. But
      Nora's words were clear to him. He saw that Harley was not loved; and a
      joy, which he felt as guilty, darted through his whole frame. From that
      interview Audley returned home greatly agitated, and at war with himself.
      Often, in the course of this story, has it been hinted that, under all
      Egerton's external coldness and measured self-control, lay a nature
      capable of strong and stubborn passions. Those passions broke forth then.
      He felt that love had already entered into the heart, which the trust of
      his friend should have sufficed to guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go there no more," said he, abruptly, to Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The girl does not love you. Cease then to think of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley disbelieved him, and grew indignant. But Audley had every worldly
      motive to assist his sense of honour. He was poor, though with the
      reputation of wealth, deeply involved in debt, resolved to rise in life,
      tenacious of his position in the world's esteem. Against a host of
      counteracting influences, love fought single-handed. Audley's was a strong
      nature; but, alas! in strong natures, if resistance to temptation is of
      granite, so the passions that they admit are of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trite is the remark that the destinies of our lives often date from the
      impulses of unguarded moments. It was so with this man, to an ordinary eye
      so cautious and so deliberate. Harley one day came to him in great grief;
      he had heard that Nora was ill: he implored Andley to go once more and
      ascertain. Audley went. Lady Jane Horton, who was suffering under a
      disease which not long afterwards proved fatal, was too ill to receive
      him. He was shown into the room set apart as Nora's. While waiting for her
      entrance, he turned mechanically over the leaves of an album, which Nora,
      suddenly summoned away to attend Lady Jane, had left behind her on the
      table. He saw the sketch of his own features; he read words inscribed
      below it,&mdash;words of such artless tenderness, and such unhoping
      sorrow, words written by one who had been accustomed to regard her genius
      as her sole confidant, under Heaven; to pour out to it, as the solitary
      poet-heart is impelled to do, thoughts, feelings, the confession of mystic
      sighs, which it would never breathe to a living ear, and, save at such
      moments, scarcely acknowledge to itself. Audley saw that he was beloved,
      and the revelation, with a sudden light, consumed all the barriers between
      himself and his own love. And at that moment Nora entered. She saw him
      bending over the book. She uttered a cry, sprang forward, and then sank
      down, covering her face with her hands. But Audley was at her feet. He
      forgot his friend, his trust; he forgot ambition, he forgot the world. It
      was his own cause that he pleaded,&mdash;his own love that burst forth
      from his lips. And when the two that day parted, they were betrothed each
      to each. Alas for them, and alas for Harley! And now this man, who had
      hitherto valued himself as the very type of gentleman, whom all his young
      contemporaries had so regarded and so revered, had to press the hand of a
      confiding friend, and bid adieu to truth. He had to amuse, to delay, to
      mislead his boy-rival,&mdash;to say that he was already subduing Nora's
      hesitating doubts, and that with a little time, she could be induced to
      consent to forget Harley's rank, and his parent's pride, and become his
      wife. And Harley believed in Egerton, without one suspicion on the mirror
      of his loyal soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Audley, impatient of his own position,&mdash;impatient, as
      strong minds ever are, to hasten what they have once resolved, to
      terminate a suspense that every interview with Harley tortured alike by
      jealousy and shame, to pass out of the reach of scruples, and to say to
      himself, "Right&mdash;or wrong, there is no looking back; the deed is
      done,"&mdash;Audley, thus hurried on by the impetus of his own power of
      will, pressed for speedy and secret nuptials,&mdash;secret, till his
      fortunes, then wavering, were more assured, his career fairly commenced.
      This was not his strongest motive, though it was one. He shrank from the
      discovery of his wrong to his friend, desired to delay the
      self-humiliation of such announcement, until, as he persuaded himself,
      Harley's boyish passion was over, had yielded to the new allurements that
      would naturally beset his way. Stifling his conscience, Audley sought to
      convince himself that the day would soon come when Harley could hear with
      indifference that Nora Avenel was another's. "The dream of an hour, at his
      age," murmured the elder friend; "but at mine the passion of a life!" He
      did not speak of these latter motives for concealment to Nora. He felt
      that to own the extent of his treason to a friend would lower him in her
      eyes. He spoke therefore but slightingly of Harley, treated the boy's suit
      as a thing past and gone. He dwelt only on reasons that compelled
      self-sacrifice on his side or hers. She did not hesitate which to choose.
      And so, where Nora loved, so submissively did she believe in the
      superiority of the lover, that she would not pause to hear a murmur from
      her own loftier nature, or question the propriety of what he deemed wise
      and good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abandoning prudence in this arch affair of life, Audley still preserved
      his customary caution in minor details. And this indeed was characteristic
      of him throughout all his career, heedless in large things, wary in small.
      He would not trust Lady Jane Horton with his secret, still less Lady
      Lansmere. He simply represented to the former that Nora was no longer safe
      from Harley's determined pursuit under Lady Jane's roof, and that she had
      better elude the boy's knowledge of her movements, and go quietly away for
      a while, to lodge with some connection of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, with Lady Jane's acquiescence, Nora went first to the house of a
      very distant kinswoman of her mother's, and afterwards to one that Egerton
      took as their bridal home, under the name of Bertram. He arranged all that
      might render their marriage most free from the chance of premature
      discovery. But it so happened on the very morning of their bridal, that
      one of the witnesses he selected (a confidential servant of his own) was
      seized with apoplexy. Considering, in haste, where to find a substitute,
      Egerton thought of Levy, his own private solicitor, his own fashionable
      money-lender, a man with whom he was then as intimate as a fine gentleman
      is with the lawyer of his own age, who knows all his affairs, and has
      helped, from pure friendship, to make them as bad as they are! Levy was
      thus suddenly summoned. Egerton, who was in great haste, did not at first
      communicate to him the name of the intended bride; but he said enough of
      the imprudence of the marriage, and his reasons for secrecy, to bring on
      himself the strongest remonstrances; for Levy had always reckoned on
      Egerton's making a wealthy marriage,&mdash;leaving to Egerton the wife,
      and hoping to appropriate to himself the wealth, all in the natural course
      of business. Egerton did not listen to him, but hurried him on towards the
      place at which the ceremony was to be performed; and Levy actually saw the
      bride before he had learned her name. The usurer masked his raging
      emotions, and fulfilled his part in the rites. His smile, when he
      congratulated the bride, might have shot cold into her heart; but her eyes
      were cast on the earth, seeing there but a shadow from heaven, and her
      heart was blindly sheltering itself in the bosom to which it was given
      evermore. She did not perceive the smile of hate that barbed the words of
      joy. Nora never thought it necessary later to tell Egerton that Levy had
      been a refused suitor. Indeed, with the exquisite tact of love, she saw
      that such a confidence, the idea of such a rival, would have wounded the
      pride of her high-bred, well-born husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, while Harley L'Estrange, frantic with the news that Nora had left
      Lady Jane's roof, and purposely misled into wrong directions, was seeking
      to trace her refuge in vain, now Egerton, in an assumed name, in a remote
      quarter, far from the clubs, in which his word was oracular, far from the
      pursuits, whether of pastime or toil, that had hitherto engrossed his
      active mind, gave himself up, with wonder at his own surrender, to the
      only vision of fairyland that ever weighs down the watchful eyelids of
      hard ambition. The world for a while shut out, he missed it not. He knew
      not of it. He looked into two loving eyes that haunted him ever after,
      through a stern and arid existence, and said murmuringly, "Why, this,
      then, is real happiness!" Often, often, in the solitude of other years, to
      repeat to himself the same words, save that for is, he then murmured was!
      And Nora, with her grand, full heart, all her luxuriant wealth of fancy
      and of thought, child of light and of song, did she then never discover
      that there was something comparatively narrow and sterile in the nature to
      which she had linked her fate? Not there could ever be sympathy in
      feelings, brilliant and shifting as the tints of the rainbow. When Audley
      pressed her heart to his own, could he comprehend one finer throb of its
      beating? Was all the iron of his mind worth one grain of the gold she had
      cast away in Harley's love?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Nora already discover this? Surely no. Genius feels no want, no
      repining, while the heart is contented. Genius in her paused and
      slumbered: it had been as the ministrant of solitude: it was needed no
      more. If a woman loves deeply some one below her own grade in the mental
      and spiritual orders, how often we see that she unconsciously quits her
      own rank, comes meekly down to the level of the beloved, is afraid lest he
      should deem her the superior,&mdash;she who would not even be the equal.
      Nora knew no more that she had genius; she only knew that she had love.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so here, the journal which Leonard was reading changed its tone,
      sinking into that quiet happiness which is but quiet because it is so
      deep. This interlude in the life of a man like Audley Egerton could never
      have been long; many circumstances conspired to abridge it. His affairs
      were in great disorder; they were all under Levy's management. Demands
      that had before slumbered, or been mildly urged, grew menacing and
      clamorous. Harley, too, returned to London from his futile researches, and
      looked out for Audley. Audley was forced to leave his secret Eden, and
      reappear in the common world; and thenceforward it was only by stealth
      that he came to his bridal home,&mdash;a visitor, no more the inmate. But
      more loud and fierce grew the demands of his creditors, now when Egerton
      had most need of all which respectability and position and belief of
      pecuniary independence can do to raise the man who has encumbered his
      arms, and crippled his steps towards fortune. He was threatened with
      writs, with prison. Levy said "that to borrow more would be but larger
      ruin," shrugged his shoulders, and even recommended a voluntary retreat to
      the King's Bench. "No place so good for frightening one's creditors into
      compounding their claims; but why," added Levy, with covert sneer, "why
      not go to young L'Estrange, a boy made to be borrowed from!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy, who had known from Lady Jane of Harley's pursuit of Nora, had
      learned already how to avenge himself on Egerton. Audley could not apply
      to the friend he had betrayed. And as to other friends, no man in town had
      a greater number. And no man in town knew better that he should lose them
      all if he were once known to be in want of their money. Mortified,
      harassed, tortured, shunning Harley, yet ever sought by him, fearful of
      each knock at his door, Audley Egerton escaped to the mortgaged remnant of
      his paternal estate, on which there was a gloomy manor-house, long
      uninhabited, and there applied a mind, afterwards renowned for its quick
      comprehension of business, to the investigation of his affairs, with a
      view to save some wreck from the flood that swelled momently around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now&mdash;to condense as much as possible a record that runs darkly on
      into pain and sorrow&mdash;now Levy began to practise his vindictive arts;
      and the arts gradually prevailed. On pretence of assisting Egerton in the
      arrangement of his affairs, which he secretly contrived, however, still
      more to complicate, he came down frequently to Egerton Hall for a few
      hours, arriving by the mail, and watching the effect which Nora's almost
      daily letters produced on the bridegroom, irritated by the practical cares
      of life. He was thus constantly at hand to instil into the mind of the
      ambitious man a regret for the imprudence of hasty passion, or to embitter
      the remorse which Audley felt for his treachery to L'Estrange. Thus ever
      bringing before the mind of the harassed debtor images at war with love,
      and with the poetry of life, he disattuned it (so to speak) for the
      reception of Nora's letters, all musical as they were with such thoughts
      as the most delicate fancy inspires to the most earnest love. Egerton was
      one of those men who never confide their affairs frankly to women. Nora,
      when she thus wrote, was wholly in the dark as to the extent of his stern
      prosaic distress. And so&mdash;and so&mdash;Levy always near&mdash;type of
      the prose of life in its most cynic form&mdash;so by degrees all that
      redundant affluence of affection, with its gushes of grief for his
      absence, prayers for his return, sweet reproach if a post failed to bring
      back an answer to the woman's yearning sighs,&mdash;all this grew, to the
      sensible, positive man of real life, like sickly romantic exaggeration.
      The bright arrows shot too high into heaven to hit the mark set so near to
      the earth. Ah, common fate of all superior natures! What treasure, and how
      wildly wasted! "By-the-by," said Levy, one morning, as he was about to
      take leave of Audley and return to town,&mdash;"by-the-by, I shall be this
      evening in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Say Mrs. Bertram!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVY.&mdash;"Ay; will she not be in want of some pecuniary supplies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON. "My wife!&mdash;Not yet. I must first be wholly ruined before she
      can want; and if I were so, do you think I should not be by her side?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVY.&mdash;"I beg pardon, my dear fellow; your pride of gentleman is so
      susceptible that it is hard for a lawyer not to wound it unawares. Your
      wife, then, does not know the exact state of your affairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Of course not. Who would confide to a woman things in
      which she could do nothing, except to tease one the more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVY.&mdash;"True, and a poetess too! I have prevented your finishing your
      answer to Mrs. Bertram's last letter. Can I take it&mdash;it may save a
      day's delay&mdash;that is, if you do not object to my calling on her this
      evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (sitting down to his unfinished letter).&mdash;"Object! no."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVY (looking at his watch).&mdash;"Be quick, or I shall lose the coach."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGEPTON (sealing the letter).&mdash;"There. And I should be obliged to you
      if you would call; and without alarming her as to my circumstances, you
      can just say that you know I am much harassed about important affairs at
      present, and so soothe the effects of my very short answers&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVY.&mdash;"To those doubly-crossed, very long letters,&mdash;I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Nora," said Egerton, sighing, "she will think this answer brief and
      churlish enough. Explain my excuses kindly, so that they will serve for
      the future. I really have no time and no heart for sentiment. The little I
      ever had is well-nigh worried out of me. Still I love her fondly and
      deeply."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVY.&mdash;"You must have done so. I never thought it in you to sacrifice
      the world to a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Nor I either; but," added the strong man, conscious of
      that power which rules the world infinitely more than knowledge, conscious
      of tranquil courage, "but I have not sacrificed the world yet. This right
      arm shall bear up her and myself too."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVY.&mdash;"Well said! but in the mean while, for heaven's sake, don't
      attempt to go to London, nor to leave this place; for, in that case, I
      know you will be arrested, and then adieu to all hopes of parliament,&mdash;of
      a career."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley's haughty countenance darkened; as the dog, in his bravest mode,
      turns dismayed from the stone plucked from the mire, so, when Ambition
      rears itself to defy mankind, whisper "disgrace and a jail,"&mdash;and,
      lo, crestfallen, it slinks away! That evening Levy called on Nora, and
      ingratiating himself into her favour by praise of Egerton, with indirect
      humble apologetic allusions to his own former presumption, he prepared the
      way to renewed visits; she was so lonely, and she so loved to see one who
      was fresh from seeing Audley, one who would talk to her of him! By degrees
      the friendly respectful visitor thus stole into her confidence; and then,
      with all his panegyrics on Audley's superior powers and gifts, he began to
      dwell upon the young husband's worldly aspirations, and care for his
      career; dwell on them so as vaguely to alarm Nora,&mdash;to imply that,
      dear as she was, she was still but second to Ambition. His way thus
      prepared, he next began to insinuate his respectful pity at her equivocal
      position, dropped hints of gossip and slander, feared that the marriage
      might be owned too late to preserve reputation. And then what would be the
      feelings of the proud Egerton if his wife were excluded from that world
      whose opinion he so prized? Insensibly thus he led her on to express
      (though timidly) her own fear, her own natural desire, in her letters to
      Audley. When could the marriage be proclaimed? Proclaimed! Audley felt
      that to proclaim such a marriage at such a moment would be to fling away
      his last cast for fame and fortune. And Harley, too,&mdash;Harley still so
      uncured of his frantic love! Levy was sure to be at hand when letters like
      these arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Levy went further still in his determination to alienate these two
      hearts. He contrived, by means of his various agents, to circulate through
      Nora's neighbourhood the very slanders at which he had hinted. He
      contrived that she should be insulted when she went abroad, outraged at
      home by the sneers of her own servant, and tremble with shame at her own
      shadow upon her abandoned bridal hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just in the midst of this intolerable anguish, Levy reappeared. His
      crowning hour was ripe. He intimated his knowledge of the humiliations
      Nora had undergone, expressed his deep compassion, offered to intercede
      with Egerton "to do her justice." He used ambiguous phrases, that shocked
      her ear and tortured her heart, and thus provoked her on to demand him to
      explain; and then, throwing her into a wild state of indefinite alarm, in
      which he obtained her solemn promise not to divulge to Audley what he was
      about to communicate, he said, with villanous hypocrisy of reluctant
      shame, "that her marriage was not strictly legal; that the forms required
      by the law had not been complied with, that Audley, unintentionally or
      purposely, had left himself free to disown the rite and desert the bride."
      While Nora stood stunned and speechless at a falsehood which, with
      lawyer-like show, he contrived to make truth-like to her inexperience, he
      hurried rapidly on, to re-awake on her mind the impression of Audley's
      pride, ambition, and respect for worldly position. "These are your
      obstacles," said he; "but I think I may induce him to repair the wrong,
      and right you at last." Righted at last&mdash;oh, infamy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Nora's anger burst forth. She believe such a stain on Audley's
      honour!
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where was the honour when he betrayed his friend? Did you not know
      that he was entrusted by Lord L'Estrange to plead for him. How did he
      fulfil the trust?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plead for L'Estrange!" Nora had not been exactly aware of this,&mdash;in
      the sudden love preceding those sudden nuptials, so little touching Harley
      (beyond Audley's first timid allusions to his suit, and her calm and cold
      reply) had been spoken by either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy resumed. He dwelt fully on the trust and the breach of it, and then
      said: "In Egerton's world, man holds it far more dishonour to betray a man
      than to dupe a woman; and if Egerton could do the one, why doubt that he
      would do the other? But do not look at me with those indignant eyes. Put
      himself to the test; write to him to say that the suspicions amidst which
      you live have become intolerable, that they infect even yourself, despite
      your reason, that the secrecy of your nuptials, his prolonged absence, his
      brief refusal, on unsatisfactory grounds, to proclaim your tie, all
      distract you with a terrible doubt. Ask him, at least (if he will not yet
      declare your marriage), to satisfy you that the rites were legal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go to him," cried Nora, impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to him!&mdash;in his own house! What a scene, what a scandal! Could he
      ever forgive you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least, then, I will implore him to come here. I can not write such
      horrible words; I cannot! I cannot! Go, go!" Levy left her, and hastened
      to two or three of Audley's most pressing creditors,&mdash;men, in fact,
      who went entirely by Levy's own advice. He bade them instantly surround
      Audley's country residence with bailiffs. Before Egerton could reach Nora,
      he would thus be lodged in a jail. These preparations made, Levy himself
      went down to Audley, and arrived, as usual, an hour or two before the
      delivery of the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Nora's letter came; and never was Audley's grave brow more dark than
      when he read it. Still, with his usual decision, he resolved to obey her
      wish,&mdash;rang the bell, and ordered his servant to put up a change of
      dress, and send for post-horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy then took him aside, and led him to the window. "Look under yon
      trees. Do you see those men? They are bailiffs. This is the true reason
      why I come to you to-day. You cannot leave this house."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton recoiled. "And this frantic, foolish letter at such a time!" he
      muttered, striking the open page, full of love in the midst of terror,
      with his clenched hand. O Woman, Woman! if thy heart be deep, and its
      chords tender, beware how thou lovest the man with whom all that plucks
      him from the hard cares of the workday world is frenzy or a folly! He will
      break thy heart, he will shatter its chords, he will trample out from its
      delicate framework every sound that now makes musical the common air, and
      swells into unison with the harps of angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has before written to me," continued Audley, pacing the room with
      angry, disordered strides, "asking me when our marriage can be proclaimed,
      and I thought my replies would have satisfied any reasonable woman. But
      now, now this is worse, immeasurably worse,&mdash;she actually doubts my
      honour! I, who have made such sacrifices,&mdash;actually doubts whether I,
      Audley Egerton, an English gentleman, could have been base enough to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" interrupted Levy, "to deceive your friend L'Estrange? Did not she
      know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" exclaimed Egerton, turning white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be angry,&mdash;all's fair in love as in war; and L'Estrange will
      live yet to thank you for saving him from such a misalliance. But you are
      seriously angry: pray, forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      With some difficulty and much fawning, the usurer appeased the storm he
      had raised in Audley's conscience. And he then heard, as if with surprise,
      the true purport of Nora's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is beneath me to answer, much less to satisfy, such a doubt," said
      Audley. "I could have seen her, and a look of reproach would have
      sufficed; but to put my hand to paper, and condescend to write, 'I am not
      a villain, and I will give you the proofs that I am not'&mdash;never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right; but let us see if we cannot reconcile matters
      between your pride and her feelings. Write simply this: 'All that you ask
      me to say or to explain, I have instructed Levy, as my solicitor, to say
      and explain for me; and you may believe him as you would myself.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the poor fool, she deserves to be punished; and I suppose that
      answer will punish her more than a lengthier rebuke.&mdash;My mind is so
      distracted, I cannot judge of these trumpery woman-fears and whims; there,
      I have written as you suggest. Give her all the proof she needs, and tell
      her that in six months at furthest, come what will, she shall bear the
      name of Egerton, as henceforth she must share his fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why say six months?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parliament must be dissolved, and there must be a general election before
      then. I shall either obtain a seat, be secure from a jail, have won field
      for my energies, or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall renounce ambition altogether, ask my brother to assist me towards
      whatever debts remain when all my property is fairly sold&mdash;they
      cannot be much. He has a living in his gift; the incumbent is old, and, I
      hear, very ill. I can take orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sink into a country parson!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And learn content. I have tasted it already. She was then by my side.
      Explain all to her. This letter, I fear, is too unkind&mdash;But to doubt
      me thus!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy hastily placed the letter in his pocketbook; and, for fear it should
      be withdrawn, took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of that letter he made such use, that the day after he had given it to
      Nora, she had left the house, the neighbourhood; fled, and not a trace! Of
      all the agonies in life, that which is most poignant and harrowing, that
      which for the time most annihilates reason, and leaves our whole
      organization one lacerated, mangled heart, is the conviction that we have
      been deceived where we placed all the trust of love. The moment the anchor
      snaps, the storm comes on, the stars vanish behind the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Levy returned, filled with the infamous hope which had stimulated his
      revenge,&mdash;the hope that if he could succeed in changing into scorn
      and indignation Nora's love for Audley, he might succeed also in replacing
      that broken and degraded idol,&mdash;his amaze and dismay were great on
      hearing of her departure. For several days he sought her traces in vain.
      He went to Lady Jane Horton's,&mdash;Nora had not been there. He trembled
      to go back to Egerton. Surely Nora would have written to her husband, and
      in spite of her promise, revealed his own falsehood; but as days passed,
      and not a clew was found, he had no option but to repair to Egerton Hall,
      taking care that the bailiffs still surrounded it. Audley had received no
      line from Nora. The young husband was surprised, perplexed, uneasy, but
      had no suspicion of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Levy was forced to break to Audley the intelligence of Nora's
      flight. He gave his own colour to it. Doubtless she had gone to seek her
      own relations, and, by their advice, take steps to make her marriage
      publicly known. This idea changed Audley's first shock into deep and stern
      resentment. His mind so little comprehended Nora's, and was ever so
      disposed to what is called the common-sense view of things, that he saw no
      other mode to account for her flight and her silence. Odious to Egerton as
      such a proceeding would be, he was far too proud to take any steps to
      guard against it. "Let her do her worst," said he, coldly, masking emotion
      with his usual self-command; "it will be but a nine days' wonder to the
      world, a fiercer rush of my creditors on their hunted prey"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a challenge from Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So be it," answered Egerton, suddenly placing his hand at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter? Are you ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A strange sensation here. My father died of a complaint of the heart, and
      I myself was once told to guard, through life, against excess of emotion.
      I smiled at such a warning then. Let us sit down to business."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Levy had gone, and solitude reclosed round that Man of the Iron
      Mask, there grew upon him more and more the sense of a mighty loss. Nora's
      sweet loving face started from the shadows of the forlorn walls. Her
      docile, yielding temper, her generous, self-immolating spirit, came back
      to his memory, to refute the idea that wronged her. His love, that had
      been suspended for awhile by busy cares, but which, if without much
      refining sentiment, was still the master passion of his soul, flowed back
      into all his thoughts,&mdash;circumfused the very atmosphere with a
      fearful, softening charm. He escaped under cover of the night from the
      watch of the bailiffs. He arrived in London. He himself sought everywhere
      he could think of for his missing bride. Lady Jane Horton was confined to
      her bed, dying fast, incapable even to receive and reply to his letter. He
      secretly sent down to Lansmere to ascertain if Nora had gone to her
      parents. She was not there. The Avenels believed her still with Lady Jane
      Horton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now grew most seriously alarmed; and in the midst of that alarm, Levy
      secretly contrived that he should be arrested for debt; but he was not
      detained in confinement many days. Before the disgrace got wind, the writs
      were discharged, Levy baffled. He was free. Lord L'Estrange had learned
      from Audley's servant what Audley would have concealed from him out of all
      the world. And the generous boy, who, besides the munificent allowance he
      received from the earl, was heir to an independent and considerable
      fortune of his own, when he should attain his majority, hastened to borrow
      the money and discharge all the obligations of his friend. The benefit was
      conferred before Audley knew of it, or could prevent. Then a new emotion,
      and perhaps scarce less stinging than the loss of Nora, tortured the man
      who had smiled at the warning of science; and the strange sensation at the
      heart was felt again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Harley, too, was still in search of Nora,&mdash;would talk of nothing
      but her, and looked so haggard and grief-worn. The bloom of the boy's
      youth was gone. Could Audley then have said, "She you seek is another's;
      your love is razed out of your life; and, for consolation, learn that your
      friend has betrayed you"? Could Audley say this? He did not dare. Which of
      the two suffered the most?
    </p>
    <p>
      And these two friends, of characters so different, were so singularly
      attached to each other,&mdash;inseparable at school, thrown together in
      the world, with a wealth of frank confidences between them, accumulated
      since childhood. And now, in the midst of all his own anxious sorrow,
      Harley still thought and planned for Egerton. And self-accusing remorse,
      and all the sense of painful gratitude, deepened Audley's affection for
      Harley into a devotion as to a superior, while softening it into a
      reverential pity that yearned to relieve, to atone; but how,&mdash;oh,
      how?
    </p>
    <p>
      A general election was now at hand, still no news of Nora. Levy kept aloof
      from Audley, pursuing his own silent search. A seat for the borough of
      Lansmere was pressed upon Audley, not only by Harley, but his parents,
      especially by the countess, who tacitly ascribed to Audley's wise counsels
      Nora's mysterious disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton at first resisted the thought of a new obligation to his injured
      friend; but he burned to have it, some day, in his power to repay at least
      his pecuniary debt: the sense of that debt humbled him more than all else.
      Parliamentary success might at last obtain for him some lucrative
      situation abroad, and thus enable him gradually to remove this load from
      his heart and his honour. No other chance of repayment appeared open to
      him. He accepted the offer, and went down to Lansmere. His brother, lately
      married, was asked to meet him; and there also was Miss Leslie the
      heiress, whom Lady Lansmere secretly hoped her son Harley would admire,
      but who had long since, no less secretly, given her heart to the
      unconscious Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the miserable Nora&mdash;deceived by the arts and
      representations of Levy, acting on the natural impulse of a heart so
      susceptible to shame, flying from a home which she deemed dishonoured,
      flying from a lover whose power over her she knew to be so great that she
      dreaded lest he might reconcile her to dishonour itself&mdash;had no
      thought save to hide herself forever from Audley's eye. She would not go
      to her relations, to Lady Jane; that were to give the clew, and invite the
      pursuit. An Italian lady of high rank had visited at Lady Jane's,&mdash;taken
      a great fancy to Nora; and the lady's husband, having been obliged to
      precede her return to Italy, had suggested the notion of engaging some
      companion; the lady had spoken of this to Nora and to Lady Jane Horton,
      who had urged Nora to accept the offer, elude Harley's pursuit, and go
      abroad for a time. Nora then had refused; for she then had seen Audley
      Egerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Italian lady she now went, and the offer was renewed with the most
      winning kindness, and grasped at in the passion of despair. But the
      Italian had accepted invitations to English country-houses before she
      finally departed for the Continent. Meanwhile Nora took refuge in a quiet
      lodging in a sequestered suburb, which an English servant in the
      employment of the fair foreigner recommended. Thus had she first come to
      the cottage in which Burley died. Shortly afterwards she left England with
      her new companion, unknown to all,&mdash;to Lady Jane as to her parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the poor girl was under a moral delirium, a confused fever,
      haunted by dreams from which she sought to fly. Sound physiologists agree
      that madness is rarest amongst persons of the finest imagination. But
      those persons are, of all others, liable to a temporary state of mind in
      which judgment sleeps,&mdash;imagination alone prevails with a dire and
      awful tyranny. A single idea gains ascendancy, expels all others, presents
      itself everywhere with an intolerable blinding glare. Nora was at that
      time under the dread one idea, to fly from shame!
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the seas rolled, and the dreary leagues interposed between her
      and her lover; when new images presented themselves; when the fever
      slaked, and reason returned,&mdash;doubt broke upon the previous despair.
      Had she not been too credulous, too hasty? Fool, fool! Audley have been so
      poor a traitor! How guilty was she, if she had wronged him! And in the
      midst of this revulsion of feeling, there stirred within her another life.
      She was destined to become a mother. At that thought her high nature
      bowed; the last struggle of pride gave way; she would return to England,
      see Audley, learn from his lips the truth, and even if the truth were what
      she had been taught to believe, plead not for herself, but for the false
      one's child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some delay occurred in the then warlike state of affairs on the Continent
      before she could put this purpose into execution; and on her journey back,
      various obstructions lengthened the way. But she returned at last, and
      resought the suburban cottage in which she had last lodged before quitting
      England. At night, she went to Audley's London house; there was only a
      woman in charge of it. Mr. Egerton was absent, electioneering somewhere;
      Mr. Levy, his lawyer, called every day for any letters to be forwarded to
      him. Nora shrank from seeing Levy, shrank from writing even a letter that
      would pass through his bands. If she had been deceived, it had been by
      him, and wilfully. But parliament was already dissolved; the election
      would soon be over. Mr. Egerton was expected to return to town within a
      week. Nora went back to Mrs. Goodyer's and resolved to wait, devouring her
      own heart in silence. But the newspapers might inform her where Audley
      really was; the newspapers were sent for and conned daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And one morning this paragraph met her eye:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   The Earl and Countess of Lansmere are receiving a distinguished
   party at their country seat. Among the guests is Miss Leslie, whose
   wealth and beauty have excited such sensation in the fashionable
   world. To the disappointment of numerous aspirants amongst our
   aristocracy, we hear that this lady has, however, made her
   distinguished choice in Mr. Audley Egerton. That gentleman is now a
   candidate for the borough of Lansmere, as a supporter of the
   Government; his success is considered certain, and, according to the
   report of a large circle of friends, few new members will prove so
   valuable an addition to the ministerial ranks. A great career may
   indeed be predicted for a young man so esteemed for talent and
   character, aided by a fortune so immense as that which he will
   shortly receive with the hand of the accomplished heiress.
</pre>
    <p>
      Again the anchor snapped, again the storm descended, again the stars
      vanished. Nora was now once more under the dominion of a single thought,
      as she had been when she fled from her bridal home. Then, it was to escape
      from her lover,&mdash;now, it was to see him. As the victim stretched on
      the rack implores to be led at once to death, so there are moments when
      the annihilation of hope seems more merciful than the torment of suspense.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the scenes in some long diorama pass solemnly before us, there is
      sometimes one solitary object, contrasting, perhaps, the view of stately
      cities or the march of a mighty river, that halts on the eye for a moment,
      and then glides away, leaving on the mind a strange, comfortless,
      undefined impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why was the object presented to us? In itself it seemed comparatively
      insignificant. It may have been but a broken column, a lonely pool with a
      star-beam on its quiet surface,&mdash;yet it awes us. We remember it when
      phantasmal pictures of bright Damascus, or of colossal pyramids, of
      bazaars in Stamboul, or lengthened caravans that defile slow amidst the
      sands of Araby, have sated the wondering gaze. Why were we detained in the
      shadowy procession by a thing that would have been so commonplace had it
      not been so lone? Some latent interest must attach to it. Was it there
      that a vision of woe had lifted the wild hair of a Prophet; there where
      some Hagar had stilled the wail of her child on her indignant breast? We
      would fain call back the pageantry procession, fain see again the solitary
      thing that seemed so little worth the hand of the artist, and ask, "Why
      art thou here, and wherefore dost thou haunt us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rise up,&mdash;rise up once more, by the broad great thoroughfare that
      stretches onward and onward to the remorseless London! Rise up, rise up, O
      solitary tree with the green leaves on thy bough, and the deep rents in
      thy heart; and the ravens, dark birds of omen and sorrow, that build their
      nest amidst the leaves of the bough, and drop with noiseless plumes down
      through the hollow rents of the heart, or are heard, it may be in the
      growing shadows of twilight, calling out to their young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the old pollard-tree, by the side of John Avenel's house, there
      cowered, breathless and listening, John Avenel's daughter Nora. Now, when
      that fatal newspaper paragraph, which lied so like truth, met her eyes,
      she obeyed the first impulse of her passionate heart,&mdash;she tore the
      wedding ring from her finger, she enclosed it, with the paragraph itself,
      in a letter to Audley,&mdash;a letter that she designed to convey scorn
      and pride&mdash;alas! it expressed only jealousy and love. She could not
      rest till she had put this letter into the post with her own hand,
      addressed to, Audley at Lord Lansmere's. Scarce had it left her ere she
      repented. What had she done,&mdash;resigned the birth-right of the child
      she was so soon to bring into the world, resigned her last hope in her
      lover's honour, given up her life of life&mdash;and from belief in what?&mdash;a
      report in a newspaper! No, no; she would go herself to Lansmere; to her
      father's home,&mdash;she could contrive to see Audley before that letter
      reached his hand. The thought was scarcely conceived before obeyed. She
      found a vacant place in a coach that started from London some hours before
      the mail, and went within a few miles of Lansmere; those last miles she
      travelled on foot. Exhausted, fainting, she gained at last the sight of
      home, and there halted, for in the little garden in front she saw her
      parents seated. She heard the murmur of their voices, and suddenly she
      remembered her altered shape, her terrible secret. How answer the
      question,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daughter, where and who is thy husband?" Her heart failed her; she crept
      under the old pollard-tree, to gather up resolve, to watch, and to listen.
      She saw the rigid face of the thrifty, prudent mother, with the deep lines
      that told of the cares of an anxious life, and the chafe of excitable
      temper and warm affections against the restraint of decorous sanctimony
      and resolute pride. The dear stern face never seemed to her more dear and
      more stern. She saw the comely, easy, indolent, good-humoured father; not
      then the poor, paralytic sufferer, who could yet recognize Nora's eyes
      under the lids of Leonard, but stalwart and jovial,&mdash;first bat in the
      Cricket Club, first voice in the Glee Society, the most popular canvasser
      of the Lansmere Constitutional True Blue Party, and the pride and idol of
      the Calvinistical prim wife; never from those pinched lips of hers had
      come forth even one pious rebuke to the careless, social man. As he sat,
      one hand in his vest, his profile turned to the road, the light smoke
      curling playfully up from the pipe, over which lips, accustomed to bland
      smile and hearty laughter, closed as if reluctant to be closed at all, he
      was the very model of the respectable retired trader in easy
      circumstances, and released from the toil of making money while life could
      yet enjoy the delight of spending it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, old woman," said John Avenel, "I must be off presently to see to
      those three shaky voters in Fish Lane; they will have done their work
      soon, and I shall catch 'em at home. They do say as how we may have an
      opposition; and I know that old Smikes has gone to Lonnon in search of a
      candidate. We can't have the Lansmere Constitutional Blues beat by a
      Lonnoner! Ha, ha, ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will be home before Jane and her husband Mark come? How ever she
      could marry a common carpenter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said John, "he is a carpenter; but he has a vote, and that
      strengthens the family interest. If Dick was not gone to Amerikay, there
      would be three on us. But Mark is a real good Blue! A Lonnoner, indeed! a
      Yellow from Lonnon beat my Lord and the Blues! Ha, ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, John, this Mr. Egerton is a Lonnoner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand things, talking such nonsense. Mr. Egerton is the
      Blue candidate, and the Blues are the Country Party; therefore how can he
      be a Lonnoner? An uncommon clever, well-grown, handsome young man, eh! and
      my young Lord's particular friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Avenel sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you sighing and shaking your head for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of our poor, dear, dear Nora!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God bless her!" cried John, heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rustle under the boughs of the old hollow-hearted
      pollard-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha! Hark! I said that so loud that I have startled the ravens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How he did love her!" said Mrs. Avenel, thoughtfully. "I am sure he did;
      and no wonder, for she looks every inch a lady; and why should not she be
      my lady, after all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He? Who? Oh, that foolish fancy of yours about my young Lord? A prudent
      woman like you!&mdash;stuff! I am glad my little beauty is gone to Lonnon,
      out of harm's way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, John, John! No harm could ever come to my Nora. She 's too pure and
      too good, and has too proper a pride in her, to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To listen to any young lords, I hope," said John; "though," he added,
      after a pause, "she might well be a lady too. My Lord, the young one, took
      me by the hand so kindly the other day, and said, 'Have not you heard from
      her&mdash;I mean Miss Avenel&mdash;lately?' and those bright eyes of his
      were as full of tears as&mdash;as&mdash;as yours are now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, John, well; go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all. My Lady came up, and took me away to talk about the
      election; and just as I was going, she whispered, 'Don't let my wild boy
      talk to you about that sweet girl of yours. We must both see that she does
      not come to disgrace.' 'Disgrace!' that word made me very angry for the
      moment. But my Lady has such a way with her that she soon put me right
      again. Yet, I do think Nora must have loved my young Lord, only she was
      too good to show it. What do you say?" And the father's voice was
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope she'll never love any man till she's married to him; it is not
      proper, John," said Mrs. Avenel, somewhat starchly, though very mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha!" laughed John, chucking his prim wife under the chin, "you did
      not say that to me when I stole your first kiss under that very
      pollard-tree&mdash;no house near it then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, John, hush!" and the prim wife blushed like a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh," continued John, merrily, "I don't see why we plain folk should
      pretend to be more saintly and prudish-like than our betters. There's that
      handsome Miss Leslie, who is to marry Mr. Egerton&mdash;easy enough to see
      how much she is in love with him,&mdash;could not keep her eyes off from
      him even in church, old girl! Ha, ha! What the deuce is the matter with
      the ravens?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll be a comely couple, John. And I hear tell she has a power of
      money. When is the marriage to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they say as soon as the election is over. A fine wedding we shall
      have of it! I dare say my young Lord will be bridesman. We'll send for our
      little Nora to see the gay doings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Out from the boughs of the old tree came the shriek of a lost spirit,&mdash;one
      of those strange, appalling sounds of human agony which, once heard, are
      never forgotten. It is as the wail of Hope, when SHE, too, rushes forth
      from the Coffer of Woes, and vanishes into viewless space; it is the dread
      cry of Reason parting from clay, and of Soul, that would wrench itself
      from life! For a moment all was still&mdash;and then a dull, dumb, heavy
      fall!
    </p>
    <p>
      The parents gazed on each other, speechless: they stole close to the
      pales, and looked over. Under the boughs, at the gnarled roots of the oak,
      they saw&mdash;gray and indistinct&mdash;a prostrate form. John opened the
      gate, and went round; the mother crept to the road-side, and there stood
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, wife, wife!" cried John Avenel, from under the green boughs, "it is
      our child Nora! Our child! our child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as he spoke, out from the green boughs started the dark ravens,
      wheeling round and round, and calling to their young!
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they had laid her on the bed, Mrs. Avenel whispered John to
      withdraw for a moment; and with set lips but trembling hands began to
      unlace the dress, under the pressure of which Nora's heart heaved
      convulsively. And John went out of the room bewildered, and sat himself
      down on the landing-place, and wondered whether he was awake or sleeping;
      and a cold numbness crept over one side of him, and his head felt very
      heavy, with a loud, booming noise in his ears. Suddenly his wife stood by
      his side, and said, in a very low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, run for Mr. Morgan,&mdash;make haste. But mind&mdash;don't speak to
      any one on the way. Quick, quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she dying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. Why not die before?" said Mrs. Avenel, between her teeth;
      "but Mr. Morgan is a discreet, friendly man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A true Blue!" muttered poor John, as if his mind wandered; and rising
      with difficulty, he stared at his wife a moment, shook his head, and was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or two later, a little, covered, taxed cart stopped at Mr.
      Avenel's cottage, out of which stepped a young man with pale face and
      spare form, dressed in the Sunday suit of a rustic craftsman; then a
      homely, but pleasant, honest face bent down to him, smilingly; and two
      arms emerging from under covert of a red cloak extended an infant, which
      the young man took tenderly. The baby was cross and very sickly; it began
      to cry. The father hushed, and rocked, and tossed it, with the air of one
      to whom such a charge was familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll be good when we get in, Mark," said the young woman, as she
      extracted from the depths of the cart a large basket containing poultry
      and home-made bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't forget the flowers that the squire's gardener gave us," said Mark
      the Poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without aid from her husband, the wife took down basket and nosegay,
      settled her cloak, smoothed her gown, and said, "Very odd! they don't seem
      to expect us, Mark. How still the house is! Go and knock; they can't ha'
      gone to bed yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark knocked at the door&mdash;no answer. A light passed rapidly across
      the windows on the upper floor, but still no one came to his summons. Mark
      knocked again. A gentleman dressed in clerical costume, now coming from
      Lansinere Park, on the opposite side of the road, paused at the sound of
      Mark's second and more impatient knock, and said civilly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not the young folks my friend John Avenel told me this morning he
      expected to visit him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, please, Mr. Dale," said Mrs. Fairfield, dropping her courtesy. "You
      remember me! and this is my dear good man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Mark the Poet?" said the curate of Lansmere, with a smile. "Come to
      write squibs for the election?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Squibs, sir!" cried Mark, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Burns wrote squibs," said the curate, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark made no answer, but again knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, a man, whose face, even seen by the starlight, was much
      flushed, presented himself at the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Morgan!" exclaimed the curate, in benevolent alarm; "no illness here,
      I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cott! it is you, Mr. Dale!&mdash;Come in, come in; I want a word with
      you. But who the teuce are these people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said Mark, pushing through the doorway, "my name is Fairfield, and
      my wife is Mr. Avenel's daughter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jane&mdash;and her baby too!&mdash;Cood! cood! Come in; but be quiet,
      can't you? Still, still&mdash;still as death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The party entered, the door closed; the moon rose, and shone calmly on the
      pale silent house, on the sleeping flowers of the little garden, on the
      old pollard with its hollow core. The horse in the taxed cart dozed
      unheeded; the light still at times flitted across the upper windows. These
      were the only signs of life, except when a bat, now and then attracted by
      the light that passed across the windows, brushed against the panes, and
      then, dipping downwards, struck up against the nose of the slumbering
      horse, and darted merrily after the moth that fluttered round the raven's
      nest in the old pollard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      All that day Harley L'Estrange had been more than usually mournful and
      dejected. Indeed, the return to scenes associated with Nora's presence
      increased the gloom that had settled on his mind since he had lost sight
      and trace of her. Audley, in the remorseful tenderness he felt for his
      injured friend, had induced L'Estrange towards evening to leave the Park,
      and go into a district some miles off, on pretence that he required
      Harley's aid there to canvass certain important outvoters: the change of
      scene might rouse him from his reveries. Harley himself was glad to escape
      from the guests at Lansmere. He readily consented to go. He would not
      return that night. The outvoters lay remote and scattered, he might be
      absent for a day or two. When Harley was gone, Egerton himself sank into
      deep thought. There was rumour of some unexpected opposition. His
      partisans were alarmed and anxious. It was clear that the Lansmere
      interest, if attacked, was weaker than the earl would believe; Egerton
      might lose his election. If so, what would become of him? How support his
      wife, whose return to him he always counted on, and whom it would then
      become him at all hazards to acknowledge? It was that day that he had
      spoken to William Hazeldean as to the family living.&mdash;"Peace, at
      least," thought the ambitious man,&mdash;"I shall have peace!" And the
      squire had promised him the rectory if needed; not without a secret pang,
      for his Harry was already using her conjugal influence in favour of her
      old school-friend's husband, Mr. Dale; and the squire thought Audley would
      be but a poor country parson, and Dale&mdash;if he would only grow a
      little plumper than his curacy would permit him to be&mdash;would be a
      parson in ten thousand. But while Audley thus prepared for the worst, he
      still brought his energies to bear on the more brilliant option; and sat
      with his Committee, looking into canvass-books, and discussing the
      characters, politics, and local interests of every elector, until the
      night was well-nigh gone. When he gained his room; the shutters were
      unclosed, and he stood a few moments at the window, gazing on the moon. At
      that sight, the thought of Nora, lost and afar, stole over him. The man,
      as we know, had in his nature little of romance and sentiment. Seldom was
      it his wont to gaze upon moon or stars. But whenever some whisper of
      romance did soften his hard, strong mind, or whenever moon or stars did
      charm his gaze from earth, Nora's bright Muse-like face, Nora's sweet
      loving eyes, were seen in moon and star-beam, Nora's low tender voice
      heard in the whisper of that which we call romance, and which is but the
      sound of the mysterious poetry that is ever in the air, would we but deign
      to hear it! He turned with a sigh, undressed, threw himself on his bed,
      and extinguished his light. But the light of the moon would fill the room.
      It kept him awake for a little time; he turned his face from the calm,
      heavenly beam resolutely towards the dull blind wall, and fell asleep.
      And, in the sleep, he was with Nora,&mdash;again in the humble
      bridal-home. Never in his dreams had she seemed to him so distinct and
      life-like,&mdash;her eyes upturned to his, her hands clasped together, and
      resting on his shoulder, as had been her graceful wont, her voice
      murmuring meekly, "Has it, then, been my fault that we parted? Forgive,
      forgive me!" And the sleeper imagined that he answered, "Never part from
      me again,&mdash;never, never!" and that he bent down to kiss the chaste
      lips that so tenderly sought his own. And suddenly he heard a knocking
      sound, as of a hammer,&mdash;regular, but soft, low, subdued. Did you
      ever, O reader, hear the sound of the hammer on the lid of a coffin in a
      house of woe,&mdash;when the undertaker's decorous hireling fears that the
      living may hear how he parts them from the dead? Such seemed the sound to
      Audley. The dream vanished abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke, and again heard the knock; it was at his door. He sat up
      wistfully; the moon was gone, it was morning. "Who is there?" he cried
      peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low voice from without answered, "Hush, it is I; dress quick; let me see
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton recognized Lady Lansmere's voice. Alarmed and surprised, he rose,
      dressed in haste, and went to the door. Lady Lansmere was standing
      without, extremely pale. She put her finger to her lip, and beckoned him
      to follow her. He obeyed mechanically. They entered her dressing-room, a
      few doors from his own chamber, and the countess closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then laying her slight firm hand on his shoulder, she said, in suppressed
      and passionate excitement,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Egerton, you must serve me, and at once. Harley! Harley! save my
      Harley! Go to him, prevent his coming back here, stay with him; give up
      the election,&mdash;it is but a year or two lost in your life, you will
      have other opportunities; make that sacrifice to your friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak&mdash;what is the matter? I can make no sacrifice too great for
      Harley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, I was sure of it. Go then, I say, at once to Harley; keep him
      away from Lansmere on any excuse you can invent, until you can break the
      sad news to him,&mdash;gently, gently. Oh, how will he bear it; how
      recover the shock? My boy, my boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Calm yourself! Explain! Break what news; recover what shock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; you do not know, you have not heard. Nora Avenel lies yonder, in
      her father's house,&mdash;dead, dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley staggered back, clapping his hand to his heart, and then dropping
      on his knee as if bowed down by the stroke of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My bride, my wife!" he muttered. "Dead&mdash;it cannot be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lansmere was so startled at this exclamation, so stunned by a
      confession wholly unexpected, that she remained unable to soothe, to
      explain, and utterly unprepared for the fierce agony that burst from the
      man she had ever seen so dignified and cold, when he sprang to his feet,
      and all the sense of his eternal loss rushed upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he crushed back his emotions, and listened in apparent calm, and
      in a silence broken but by quick gasps for breath, to Lady Lansmere's
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the guests in the house, a female relation of Lady Lansmere's, had
      been taken suddenly ill about an hour or two before; the house had been
      disturbed, the countess herself aroused, and Mr. Morgan summoned as the
      family medical practitioner. From him she had learned that Nora Avenel had
      returned to her father's house late on the previous evening, had been
      seized with brain fever, and died in a few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley listened, and turned to the door, still in silence. Lady Lansmere
      caught him by the arm. "Where are you going? Ah, can I now ask you to save
      my son from the awful news, you yourself the sufferer? And yet&mdash;yet&mdash;you
      know his haste, his vehemence, if he learned that you were his rival, her
      husband; you whom he so trusted! What, what would be the result?&mdash;I
      tremble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tremble not,&mdash;I do not tremble! Let me go! I will be back soon, and
      then,"&mdash;(his lips writhed)&mdash;"then we will talk of Harley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton went forth, stunned and dizzy. Mechanically he took his way across
      the park to John Avenel's house. He had been forced to enter that house,
      formally, a day or two before, in the course of his canvass; and his
      worldly pride had received a shock when the home, the birth, and the
      manners of his bride's parents had been brought before him. He had even
      said to himself, "And is it the child of these persons that I, Audley
      Egerton, must announce to the world as wife?" Now, if she had been the
      child of a beggar-nay, of a felon&mdash;now if he could but recall her to
      life, how small and mean would all that dreaded world appear to him! Too
      late, too late! The dews were glistening in the sun, the birds were
      singing overhead, life wakening all around him&mdash;and his own heart
      felt like a charnel-house. Nothing but death and the dead there,&mdash;nothing!
      He arrived at the door: it was open: he called; no one answered: he walked
      up the narrow stairs, undisturbed, unseen; he came into the chamber of
      death. At the opposite side of the bed was seated John Avenel; but he
      seemed in a heavy sleep. In fact, paralysis had smitten him; but he knew
      it not; neither did any one. Who could heed the strong hearty man in such
      a moment? Not even the poor anxious wife! He had been left there to guard
      the house, and watch the dead,&mdash;an unconscious man; numbed, himself,
      by the invisible icy hand! Audley stole to the bedside; he lifted the
      coverlid thrown over the pale still face. What passed within him during
      the minute he stayed there who shall say? But when he left the room, and
      slowly descended the stairs, he left behind him love and youth, all the
      sweet hopes and joys of the household human life, for ever and ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to Lady Lansmere, who awaited his coming with the most nervous
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said he, dryly, "I will go to Harley, and I will prevent his
      returning hither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen the parents. Good heavens! do they know of your marriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; to Harley I must own it first. Meanwhile, silence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence!" echoed Lady Lansmere; and her burning hand rested in Audley's,
      and Audley's hand was as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another hour Egerton had left the house, and before noon he was with
      Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary now to explain the absence of all the Avenel family,
      except the poor stricken father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nora had died in giving birth to a child,&mdash;died delirious. In her
      delirium she had spoken of shame, of disgrace; there was no holy nuptial
      ring on her finger. Through all her grief, the first thought of Mrs.
      Avenel was to save the good name of her lost daughter, the unblemished
      honour of all the living Avenels. No matron long descended from knights or
      kings had keener pride in name and character than the poor, punctilious
      Calvinistic trader's wife. "Sorrow later, honour now!" With hard dry eyes
      she mused and mused, and made out her plan. Jane Fairfield should take
      away the infant at once, before the day dawned, and nurse it with her own.
      Mark should go with her, for Mrs. Avenel dreaded the indiscretion of his
      wild grief. She would go with them herself part of the way, in order to
      command or reason them into guarded silence. But they could not go back to
      Hazeldean with another infant; Jane must go where none knew her; the two
      infants might pass as twins. And Mrs. Avenel, though naturally a humane,
      kindly woman, and with a mother's heart to infants, looked with almost a
      glad sternness at Jane's puny babe, and thought to herself, "All
      difficulty would be over should there be only one! Nora's child could thus
      pass throughout life for Jane's!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for the preservation of the secret, the Avenels kept no
      servant,&mdash;only an occasional drudge, who came a few hours in the day,
      and went home to sleep. Mrs. Avenel could count on Mr. Morgan's silence as
      to the true cause of Nora's death. And Mr. Dale, why should be reveal the
      dishonour of a family? That very day, or the next at furthest, she could
      induce her husband to absent himself, lest he should blab out the tale
      while his sorrow was greater than his pride. She alone would then stay in
      the house of death until she could feel assured that all else were hushed
      into prudence. Ay, she felt, that with due precautions, the name was still
      safe. And so she awed and hurried Mark and his wife away, and went with
      them in the covered cart, that hid the faces of all three, leaving for an
      hour or two the house and the dead to her husband's charge, with many an
      admonition, to which he nodded his head, and which he did not hear. Do you
      think this woman was unfeeling and inhuman? Had Nora looked from heaven
      into her mother's heart Nora would not have thought so. A good name when
      the burial stone closes over dust is still a possession upon the earth; on
      earth it is indeed our only one! Better for our friends to guard for us
      that treasure than to sit down and weep over perishable clay. And weep!&mdash;Oh,
      stern mother, long years were left to thee for weeping! No tears shed for
      Nora made such deep furrows on the cheeks as thine did! Yet who ever saw
      them flow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was in great surprise to see Egerton; more surprised when Egerton
      told him that he found he was to be opposed,&mdash;that he had no chance
      of success at Lansmere, and had, therefore, resolved to retire from the
      contest. He wrote to the earl to that effect; but the countess knew the
      true cause, and hinted it to the earl; so that, as we saw at the
      commencement of this history, Egerton's cause did not suffer when Captain
      Dashmore appeared in the borough; and, thanks to Mr. Hazeldean's exertions
      and oratory, Audley came in by two votes,&mdash;the votes of John Avenel
      and Mark Fairfield. For though the former had been removed a little way
      from the town, and by medical advice, and though, on other matters, the
      disease that had smitten him left him docile as a child (and he had but
      vague indistinct ideas of all the circumstances connected with Nora's
      return, save the sense of her loss), yet he still would hear how the Blues
      went on, and would get out of bed to keep his word: and even his wife
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is right; better die of it than break his promise!" The crowd gave way
      as the broken man they had seen a few days before so jovial and healthful
      was brought up in a chair to the poll, and said, with his tremulous
      quavering voice, "I 'm a true Blue,&mdash;Blue forever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Elections are wondrous things! No man who has not seen can guess how the
      zeal in them triumphs over sickness, sorrow, the ordinary private life of
      us!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was forwarded to Audley, from Lansmere Park, Nora's last letter. The
      postman had left it there an hour or two after he himself had gone. The
      wedding-ring fell on the ground, and rolled under his feet. And those
      burning, passionate reproaches, all that anger of the wounded dove,
      explained to him the mystery of her return, her unjust suspicions, the
      cause of her sudden death, which he still ascribed to brain fever, brought
      on by excitement and fatigue. For Nora did not speak of the child about to
      be born; she had not remembered it when she wrote, or she would not have
      written. On the receipt of this letter, Egerton could not remain in the
      dull village district,&mdash;alone, too, with Harley. He said, abruptly,
      that he must go to London; prevailed on L'Estrange to accompany him; and
      there, when he heard from Lady Lansmere that the funeral was over, he
      broke to Harley, with lips as white as the dead, and his hand pressed to
      his heart, on which his hereditary disease was fastening quick and fierce,
      the dread truth that Nora was no more. The effect upon the boy's health
      and spirits was even more crushing than Audley could anticipate. He only
      woke from grief to feel remorse. "For," said the noble Harley, "had it not
      been for my passion, my rash pursuit, would she ever have left her safe
      asylum,&mdash;ever even have left her native town? And then&mdash;and then&mdash;the
      struggle between her sense of duty and her love to me! I see it all&mdash;all!
      But for me she were living still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" cried Egerton, his confession now rushing to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, she never loved you as you think. Nay, nay, hear me! Rather
      suppose that she loved another, fled with him, was perhaps married to him,
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" exclaimed Harley, with a terrible burst of passion,&mdash;"you
      kill her twice to me if you say that! I can still feel that she lives&mdash;lives
      here, in my heart&mdash;while I dream that she loved me&mdash;or, at
      least, that no other lip ever knew the kiss that was denied to mine! But
      if you tell me to doubt that&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;" The boy's anguish
      was too great for his frame; he fell suddenly back into Audley's arms; he
      had broken a blood-vessel. For several days he was in great danger; but
      his eyes were constantly fixed on Audley's, with wistful intense gaze.
      "Tell me," he muttered, at the risk of re-opening the ruptured veins, and
      of the instant loss of life,&mdash;"tell me, you did not mean that! Tell
      me you have no cause to think she loved another&mdash;was another's!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, hush! no cause&mdash;none&mdash;none! I meant but to comfort you,
      as I thought,&mdash;fool that I was!&mdash;that is all!" cried the
      miserable friend. And from that hour Audley gave up the idea of righting
      himself in his own eyes, and submitted still to be the living lie,&mdash;he,
      the haughty gentleman!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, while Harley was still very weak and suffering, Mr. Dale came to
      London, and called on Egerton. The curate, in promising secrecy to Mrs.
      Avenel, had made one condition, that it should not be to the positive
      injury of Nora's living son. What if Nora were married after all? And
      would it not be right, at least, to learn the name of the child's father?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some day he might need a father. Mrs. Avenel was obliged to content
      herself with these reservations. However, she implored Mr. Dale not to
      make inquiries. What could they do? If Nora were married, her husband
      would naturally, of his own accord, declare himself; if seduced and
      forsaken, it would but disgrace her memory (now saved from stain) to
      discover the father to a child of whose very existence the world as yet
      knew nothing. These arguments perplexed the good curate. But Jane
      Fairfield had a sanguine belief in her sister's innocence; and all her
      suspicions naturally pointed to Lord L'Estrange. So, indeed, perhaps; did
      Mrs. Avenel's, though she never owned them. Of the correctness of these
      suspicions Mr. Dale was fully convinced; the young lord's admiration, Lady
      Lansmere's fears, had been too evident to one who had often visited at the
      Park; Harley's abrupt departure just before Nora's return home; Egerton's
      sudden resignation of the borough before even opposition was declared, in
      order to rejoin his friend, the very day of Nora's death,&mdash;all
      confirmed his ideas that Harley was the betrayer or the husband. Perhaps
      there might have been a secret marriage&mdash;possibly abroad&mdash;since
      Harley wanted some years of his majority. He would, at least, try to see
      and to sound Lord L'Estrange. Prevented this interview by Harley's
      illness, the curate resolved to ascertain how far he could penetrate into
      the mystery by a conversation with Egerton. There was much in the grave
      repute which the latter had acquired, and the singular and pre-eminent
      character for truth and honour with which it was accompanied, that made
      the curate resolve upon this step. Accordingly; he saw Egerton, meaning
      only diplomatically to extract from the new member for Lansmere what might
      benefit the family of the voters who had given him his majority of two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by mentioning, as a touching fact, how poor John Avenel, bowed
      down by the loss of his child and the malady which had crippled his limbs
      and enfeebled his mind, had still risen from his bed to keep his word. And
      Audley's emotions seemed to him so earnest and genuine, to show so good a
      heart, that out by little and little came more: first, his suspicions that
      poor Nora had been betrayed; then his hopes that there might have been
      private marriage; and as Audley, with his iron self-command, showed just
      the proper degree of interest, and no more, he went on, till Audley knew
      that he had a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inquire no further!" said the man of the world. "Respect Mrs. Avenel's
      feelings and wishes, I entreat you; they are the right ones. Leave the
      rest to me. In my position&mdash;I mean as a resident of London&mdash;I
      can quietly and easily ascertain more than you could, and provoke no
      scandal! If I can right this&mdash;this&mdash;poor&mdash;[his voice
      trembled]&mdash;right the lost mother, or the living child, sooner or
      later you will hear from me; if not, bury this secret where it now rests,
      in a grave which slander has not reached. But the child&mdash;give me the
      address where it is to be found&mdash;in case I succeed in finding the
      father, and touching his heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Egerton, may I not say where you may find that father&mdash;who
      he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be angry; and, after all, I cannot ask you to betray any
      confidence which a friend may have placed in you. I know what you men of
      high honour are to each other, even in sin. No, no, I beg pardon; I leave
      all in your hands. I shall hear from you then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or if not, why, then, believe that all search is hopeless. My friend! if
      you mean Lord L'Estrange, he is innocent. I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;[the
      voice faltered]&mdash;am convinced of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The curate sighed, but made no answer. "Oh, ye men of the world!" thought
      he. He gave the address which the member for Lansmere had asked for, and
      went his way, and never heard again from Audley Egerton. He was convinced
      that the man who had showed such deep feeling had failed in his appeal to
      Harley's conscience, or had judged it best to leave Nora's name in peace,
      and her child to her own relations and the care of Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley L'Estrange, scarcely yet recovered, hastened to join our armies on
      the Continent, and seek the Death which, like its half-brother, rarely
      comes when we call it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Harley was gone, Egerton went to the village to which Mr. Dale
      had directed him, to seek for Nora's child. But here he was led into a
      mistake which materially affected the tenor of his own life, and Leonard's
      future destinies. Mrs. Fairfield had been naturally ordered by her mother
      to take another name in the village to which she had gone with the two
      infants, so that her connection with the Avenel family might not be
      traced, to the provocation of inquiry and gossip. The grief and excitement
      through which she had gone dried the source of nutriment in her breast.
      She put Nora's child out to nurse at the house of a small farmer, at a
      little distance from the village, and moved from her first lodging to be
      nearer to the infant. Her own child was so sickly and ailing, that she
      could not bear to intrust it to the care of an other. She tried to bring
      it up by hand; and the poor child soon pined away and died. She and Mark
      could not endure the sight of their baby's grave; they hastened to return
      to Hazeldean, and took Leonard with them. From that time Leonard passed
      for the son they had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Egerton arrived at the village, and inquired for the person whose
      address had been given to him, he was referred to the cottage in which she
      had last lodged, and was told that she had been gone some days,&mdash;the
      day after her child was buried. Her child buried! Egerton stayed to
      inquire no more; thus he heard nothing of the infant that had been put out
      to nurse. He walked slowly into the churchyard, and stood for some minutes
      gazing on the small new mound; then, pressing his hand on the heart to
      which all emotion had been forbidden, he re-entered his chaise and
      returned to London. The sole reason for acknowledging his marriage seemed
      to him now removed. Nora's name had escaped reproach. Even had his painful
      position with regard to Harley not constrained him to preserve his secret,
      there was every motive to the world's wise and haughty son not to
      acknowledge a derogatory and foolish marriage, now that none lived whom
      concealment could wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley mechanically resumed his former life,&mdash;sought to resettle his
      thoughts on the grand objects of ambitious men. His poverty still pressed
      on him; his pecuniary debt to Harley stung and galled his peculiar sense
      of honour. He saw no way to clear his estates, to repay his friend, but by
      some rich alliance. Dead to love, he faced this prospect first with
      repugnance, then with apathetic indifference. Levy, of whose treachery
      towards himself and Nora he was unaware, still held over him the power
      that the money-lender never loses over the man that has owed, owes, or may
      owe again. Levy was ever urging him to propose, to the rich Miss Leslie;
      Lady Lansmere, willing to atone, as she thought, for his domestic loss,
      urged the same; Harley, influenced by his mother, wrote from the Continent
      to the same effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manage it as you will," at last said Egerton to Levy, "so that I am not a
      wife's pensioner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Propose for me, if you will," he said to Lady Lansmere,&mdash;"I cannot
      woo,&mdash;I cannot talk of love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other the marriage, with all its rich advantages to the ruined
      gentleman, was thus made up. And Egerton, as we have seen, was the polite
      and dignified husband before the world,&mdash;married to a woman who
      adored him. It is the common fate of men like him to be loved too well!
    </p>
    <p>
      On her death-bed his heart was touched by his wife's melancholy reproach,&mdash;"Nothing
      I could do has ever made you love me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," answered Audley, with tears in his voice and eyes; "Nature
      gave me but a small fund of what women like you call 'love,' and I
      lavished it all away." And he then told her, though with reserve, some
      portion of his former history; and that soothed her; for when she saw that
      he had loved, and could grieve, she caught a glimpse of the human heart
      she had not seen before. She died, forgiving him, and blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley's spirits were much affected by this new loss. He inly resolved
      never to marry again. He had a vague thought at first of retrenching his
      expenditure, and making young Randal Leslie his heir. But when he first
      saw the clever Eton boy, his feelings did not warm to him, though his
      intellect appreciated Randal's quick, keen talents. He contented himself
      with resolving to push the boy,&mdash;to do what was merely just to the
      distant kinsman of his late wife. Always careless and lavish in money
      matters, generous and princely, not from the delight of serving others,
      but from a grand seigneur's sentiment of what was due to himself and his
      station, Audley had a mournful excuse for the lordly waste of the large
      fortune at his control. The morbid functions of the heart had become
      organic disease. True, he might live many years, and die at last of some
      other complaint in the course of nature; but the progress of the disease
      would quicken with all emotional excitement; he might die suddenly&mdash;any
      day&mdash;in the very prime, and, seemingly, in the full vigour, of his
      life. And the only physician in whom he confided what he wished to keep
      concealed from the world (for ambitious men would fain be thought
      immortal) told him frankly that it was improbable that, with the wear and
      tear of political strife and action, he could advance far into middle age.
      Therefore, no son of his succeeding&mdash;his nearest relations all
      wealthy&mdash;Egerton resigned himself to his constitutional disdain of
      money; he could look into no affairs, provided the balance in his banker's
      hands were such as became the munificent commoner. All else he left to his
      steward and to Levy. Levy grew rapidly rich,&mdash;very, very rich,&mdash;and
      the steward thrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usurer continued to possess a determined hold over the imperious great
      man. He knew Audley's secret; he could reveal that secret to Harley. And
      the one soft and tender side of the statesman's nature&mdash;the sole part
      of him not dipped in the ninefold Styx of practical prosaic life, which
      renders man so invulnerable to affection&mdash;was his remorseful love for
      the school friend whom he still deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here then you have the key to the locked chambers of Audley Egerton's
      character, the fortified castle of his mind. The envied minister, the
      joyless man; the oracle on the economies of an empire, the prodigal in a
      usurer's hands; the august, high-crested gentleman, to whom princes would
      refer for the casuistry of honour, the culprit trembling lest the friend
      he best loved on earth should detect his lie! Wrap thyself in the decent
      veil that the Arts or the Graces weave for thee, O Human Nature! It is
      only the statue of marble whose nakedness the eye can behold without shame
      and offence!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of the narrative just placed before the reader, it is clear that Leonard
      could gather only desultory fragments. He could but see that his ill-fated
      mother had been united to a man she had loved with surpassing tenderness;
      had been led to suspect that the marriage was fraudulent; had gone abroad
      in despair; returned repentant and hopeful; had gleaned some intelligence
      that her lover was about to be married to another, and there the
      manuscript closed with the blisters left on the page by agonizing tears.
      The mournful end of Nora, her lonely return to die under the roof of her
      parents,&mdash;this he had learned before from the narrative of Dr.
      Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even the name of her supposed husband was not revealed. Of him Leonard
      could form no conjecture, except that he was evidently of higher rank than
      Nora. Harley L'Estrange seemed clearly indicated in the early boy-lover.
      If so, Harley must know all that was left dark to Leonard, and to him
      Leonard resolved to confide the manuscripts. With this resolution he left
      the cottage, resolving to return and attend the funeral obsequies of his
      departed friend. Mrs. Goodyer willingly permitted him to take away the
      papers she had lent to him, and added to them the packet which had been
      addressed to Mrs. Bertram from the Continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musing in anxious gloom over the record he had read, Leonard entered
      London on foot, and bent his way towards Harley's hotel; when, just as he
      had crossed into Bond Street, a gentleman in company with Baron Levy, and
      who seemed, by the flush on his brow and the sullen tone of his voice, to
      have had rather an irritating colloquy with the fashionable usurer,
      suddenly caught sight of Leonard, and, abruptly quitting Levy, seized the
      young man by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, sir," said the gentleman, looking hard into Leonard's face,
      "but unless these sharp eyes of mine are mistaken, which they seldom are,
      I see a nephew whom, perhaps, I behaved to rather too harshly, but who
      still has no right to forget Richard Avenel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear uncle," exclaimed Leonard, "this is indeed a joyful surprise; at
      a time, too, when I needed joy! No; I have never forgotten your kindness,
      and always regretted our estrangement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well said; give us your fist again. Let me look at you&mdash;quite
      the gentleman, I declare&mdash;still so good-looking too. We Avenels
      always were a handsome family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, Baron Levy. Need not wait for me; I am not going to run away. I
      shall see you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," whispered Levy, who had followed Avenel across the street, and eyed
      Leonard with a quick, curious, searching glance&mdash;"but it must be as I
      say with regard to the borough; or (to be plain) you must cash the bills
      on the day they are due."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir, very well. So you think to put the screw upon me, as if I
      were a poor little householder. I understand,&mdash;my money or my
      borough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly so," said the baron, with a soft smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear from me." (Aside, as Levy strolled away)&mdash;"D&mdash;-d
      tarnation rascal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Avenel then linked his arm in his nephew's, and strove for some
      minutes to forget his own troubles, in the indulgence of that curiosity in
      the affairs of another, which was natural to him, and in this instance
      increased by the real affection which he had felt for Leonard. But still
      his curiosity remained unsatisfied; for long before Leonard could overcome
      his habitual reluctance to speak of his success in literature, Dick's mind
      wandered back to his rival at Screwstown, and the curse of
      "over-competition,"&mdash;to the bills which Levy had discounted, in order
      to enable Dick to meet the crushing force of a capitalist larger than
      himself, and the "tarnation rascal" who now wished to obtain two seats at
      Lansmere, one for Randal Leslie, one for a rich Nabob whom Levy had just
      caught as a client, and Dick, though willing to aid Leslie, had a mind to
      the other seat for himself. Therefore Dick soon broke in upon the
      hesitating confessions of Leonard, with exclamations far from pertinent to
      the subject, and rather for the sake of venting his own griefs and
      resentment than with any idea that the sympathy or advice of his nephew
      could serve him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," said Dick, "another time for your history. I see you have
      thrived, and that is enough for the present. Very odd; but just now I can
      only think of myself. I'm in a regular fix, sir. Screwstown is not the
      respectable Screwstown that you remember it&mdash;all demoralized and
      turned topsy-turvy by a demoniacal monster capitalist, with steam-engines
      that might bring the falls of Niagara into your back parlour, sir! And as
      if that was not enough to destroy and drive into almighty shivers a decent
      fair-play Britisher like myself, I hear he is just in treaty for some
      patent infernal invention that will make his engines do twice as much work
      with half as many hands! That's the way those unfeeling ruffians increase
      our poor-rates! But I 'll get up a riot against him, I will! Don't talk to
      me of the law! What the devil is the good of the law if it don't protect a
      man's industry,&mdash;a liberal man, too, like me!" Here Dick burst into a
      storm of vituperation against the rotten old country in general, and Mr.
      Dyce, the monster capitalist of Screwstown, in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard started; for Dick now named, in that monster capitalist, the very
      person who was in treaty for Leonard's own mechanical improvement on the
      steam-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, uncle, stop! Why, then, if this man were to buy the contrivance you
      speak of, it would injure you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Injure me, sir! I should be a bankrupt,&mdash;that is, if it succeeded;
      but I dare say it is all a humbug."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it will succeed,&mdash;I 'll answer for that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! You have seen it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I invented it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick hastily withdrew his arm from Leonard's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serpent's tooth!" he said falteringly, "so it is you, whom I warmed at my
      hearth, who are to ruin Richard Avenel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but to save him! Come into the City and look at my model. If you like
      it, the patent shall be yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cab, cab, cab," cried Dick Avenel, stopping a 'Ransom;' "jump in,
      Leonard,&mdash;jump in. I'll buy your patent,&mdash;that is, if it be
      worth a straw; and as for payment&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Payment! Don't talk of that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I won't," said Dick, mildly; "for 't is not the topic of
      conversation I should choose myself, just at present. And as for that
      black-whiskered alligator, the baron, let me first get out of those
      rambustious, unchristian, filbert-shaped claws of his, and then&mdash;but
      jump in! jump in! and tell the man where to drive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A very brief inspection of Leonard's invention sufficed to show Richard
      Avenel how invaluable it would be to him. Armed with a patent, of which
      the certain effects in the increase of power and diminution of labour were
      obvious to any practical man, Avenel felt that he should have no
      difficulty in obtaining such advances of money as he required, whether to
      alter his engines, meet the bills discounted by Levy, or carry on the war
      with the monster capitalist. It might be necessary to admit into
      partnership some other monster capitalist&mdash;What then? Any partner
      better than Levy. A bright idea struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I can just terrify and whop that infernal intruder on my own ground
      for a few months, he may offer, himself, to enter into partnership,&mdash;make
      the two concerns a joint-stock friendly combination, and then we shall
      flog the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      His gratitude to Leonard became so lively that Dick offered to bring his
      nephew in for Lansmere instead of himself; and when Leonard declined the
      offer, exclaimed, "Well, then, any friend of yours; I'm all for reform
      against those high and mighty right honourable borough-mongers; and what
      with loans and mortgages on the small householders, and a long course of
      'Free and Easies' with the independent freemen, I carry one&mdash;seat
      certain, perhaps both seats of the town of Lansmere, in my breeches
      pocket." Dick then, appointing an interview with Leonard at his lawyer's,
      to settle the transfer of the invention, upon terms which he declared
      "should be honourable to both parties," hurried off, to search amongst his
      friends in the City for some monster capitalist, who alight be induced to
      extricate him from the jaws of Levy and the engines of his rival at
      Screwstown. "Mullins is the man, if I can but catch him," said Dick. "You
      have heard of Mullins?&mdash;a wonderful great man; you should see his
      nails; he never cuts them! Three millions, at least, he has scraped
      together with those nails of his, sir. And in this rotten old country, a
      man must have nails a yard long to fight with a devil like Levy! Good-by,
      good-by,&mdash;Goon-by, MY DEAR, nephew!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harley L'Estrange was seated alone in his apartments. He had just put down
      a volume of some favourite classic author, and he was resting his hand
      firmly clenched upon the book. Ever since Harley's return to England,
      there had been a perceptible change in the expression of his countenance,
      even in the very bearing and attitudes of his elastic youthful figure. But
      this change had been more marked since that last interview with Helen
      which has been recorded. There was a compressed, resolute firmness in the
      lips, a decided character in the brow. To the indolent, careless grace of
      his movements had succeeded a certain indescribable energy, as quiet and
      self-collected as that which distinguished the determined air of Audley
      Egerton himself. In fact, if you could have looked into his heart, you
      would have seen that Harley was, for the first time, making a strong
      effort over his passions and his humours; that the whole man was nerving
      himself to a sense of duty. "No," he muttered,&mdash;"no! I will think
      only of Helen; I will think only of real life! And what (were I not
      engaged to another) would that dark-eyed Italian girl be to me?&mdash;What
      a mere fool's fancy is this! I love again,&mdash;I, who through all the
      fair spring of my life have clung with such faith to a memory and a grave!
      Come, come, come, Harley L'Estrange, act thy part as man amongst men, at
      last! Accept regard; dream no more of passion. Abandon false ideals. Thou
      art no poet&mdash;why deem that life itself can be a poem?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and the Austrian prince, whom Harley had interested in
      the cause of Violante's father, entered, with the familiar step of a
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you discovered those documents yet?" said the prince. "I must now
      return to Vienna within a few days; and unless you can arm me with some
      tangible proof of Peschiera's ancient treachery, or some more unanswerable
      excuse for his noble kinsman, I fear that there is no other hope for the
      exile's recall to his country than what lies in the hateful option of
      giving his daughter to his perfidious foe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said Harley, "as yet all researches have been in vain; and I know
      not what other steps to take, without arousing Peschiera's vigilance, and
      setting his crafty brains at work to counteract us. My poor friend, then,
      must rest contented with exile. To give Violante to the count were
      dishonour. But I shall soon be married; soon have a home, not quite
      unworthy of their due rank, to offer both to father and to child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would the future Lady L'Estrange feel no jealousy of a guest so fair as
      you tell me this young signorina is? And would you be in no danger
      yourself, my poor friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" said Harley, colouring. "My fair guest would have two fathers;
      that is all. Pray do not jest on a thing so grave as honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the door opened, and Leonard appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Welcome," cried Harley, pleased to be no longer alone under the prince's
      penetrating eye,&mdash;"welcome. This is the noble friend who shares our
      interest for Riccabocca, and who could serve him so well, if we could but
      discover the document of which I have spoken to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is here," said Leonard, simply; "may it be all that you require!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley eagerly grasped at the packet, which had been sent from Italy to
      the supposed Mrs. Bertram, and, leaning his face on his hand, rapidly
      hurried through the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah!" he cried at last, with his face lighted up, and a boyish toss of
      his right hand. "Look, look, Prince, here are Peschiera's own letters to
      his kinsman's wife; his avowal of what he calls his 'patriotic designs;'
      his entreaties to her to induce her husband to share them. Look, look, how
      he wields his influence over the woman he had once wooed; look how
      artfully he combats her objections; see how reluctant our friend was to
      stir, till wife and kinsman both united to urge him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is enough,-quite enough," exclaimed the prince, looking at the
      passages in Peschiera's letters which Harley pointed out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is not enough," shouted Harley, as he continued to read the
      letters with his rapid sparkling eyes. "More still! O villain, doubly
      damned! Here, after our friend's flight, here is Peschiera's avowal of
      guilty passion; here, he swears that he had intrigued to ruin his
      benefactor, in order to pollute the home that had sheltered him. Ah, see
      how she answers! thank Heaven her own eyes were opened at last, and she
      scorned him before she died! She was innocent! I said so. Violante's
      mother was pure. Poor lady, this moves me! Has your emperor the heart of a
      man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know enough of our emperor," answered the prince, warmly, "to know
      that, the moment these papers reach him, Peschiera is ruined, and your
      friend is restored to his honours. You will live to see the daughter, to
      whom you would have given a child's place at your hearth, the wealthiest
      heiress of Italy,&mdash;the bride of some noble lover, with rank only
      below the supremacy of kings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Harley, in a sharp accent, and turning very pale,&mdash;"ah, I
      shall not see her that! I shall never visit Italy again!&mdash;never see
      her more,&mdash;never, after she has once quitted this climate of cold
      iron cares and formal duties! never, never!" He turned his head for a
      moment, and then came with quick step to Leonard. "But you, O happy poet!
      No Ideal can ever be lost to you. You are independent of real life. Would
      that I were a poet!" He smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not say so, perhaps, my dear Lord," answered Leonard, with
      equal sadness, "if you knew how little what you call 'the Ideal' replaces
      to a poet the loss of one affection in the genial human world. Independent
      of real life! Alas! no. And I have here the confessions of a true
      poet-soul, which I will entreat you to read at leisure; and when you have
      read, say if you would still be a poet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took forth Nora's manuscripts as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Place them yonder, in my escritoire, Leonard; I will read them later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, and with heed; for to me there is much here that involves my own
      life,&mdash;much that is still a mystery, and which I think you can
      unravel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" exclaimed Harley; and he was moving towards the escritoire, in a
      drawer of which Leonard had carefully deposited the papers, when once
      more, but this time violently, the door was thrown open, and Giacomo
      rushed into the room, accompanied by Lady Lansmere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my Lord, my Lord!" cried Giacomo, in Italian, "the signorina! the
      signorina! Violante!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of her? Mother, Mother! what of her? Speak, speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has gone,&mdash;left our house!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Left! No, no!" cried Giacomo. "She must have been deceived or forced
      away. The count! the count! Oh, my good Lord, save her, as you once saved
      her father!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" cried Harley. "Give me your arm, Mother. A second such blow in
      life is beyond the strength of man,&mdash;at least it is beyond mine. So,
      so! I am better now! Thank you, Mother. Stand back, all of you! give me
      air. So the count has triumphed, and Violante has fled with him! Explain
      all,&mdash;I can bear it!"

    <h3>
      WHEREIN THE CAXTON FAMILY REAPPEAR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Again," quoth my father,&mdash;"again behold us! We who greeted the
      commencement of your narrative, who absented ourselves in the midcourse
      when we could but obstruct the current of events, and jostle personages
      more important,&mdash;we now gather round the close. Still, as the chorus
      to the drama, we circle round the altar with the solemn but dubious chant
      which prepares the audience for the completion of the appointed destinies;
      though still, ourselves, unaware how the skein is to be unravelled, and
      where the shears are to descend."
    </p>
    <p>
      So there they stood, the Family of Caxton,&mdash;all grouping round me,
      all eager officiously to question, some over-anxious prematurely to
      criticise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Violante can't have voluntarily gone off with that horrid count," said my
      mother; "but perhaps she was deceived, like Eugenia by Mr. Bellamy, in the
      novel of 'CAMILLA'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" said my father, "and in that case it is time yet to steal a hint
      from Clarissa Harlowe, and make Violante die less of a broken heart than a
      sullied honour. She is one of those girls who ought to be killed! All
      things about her forebode an early tomb!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear, dear!" cried Mrs. Caxton, "I hope not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, brother," said the captain, "we have had enough of the tomb in the
      history of poor Nora. The whole story grows out of a grave, and if to a
      grave it must return&mdash;if, Pisistratus, you must kill somebody&mdash;kill
      Levy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or the count," said my mother, with unusual truculence. "Or Randal
      Leslie," said Squills. "I should like to have a post-mortem cast of his
      head,&mdash;it would be an instructive study."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a general confusion of tongues, all present conspiring to
      bewilder the unfortunate author with their various and discordant counsels
      how to wind up his story and dispose of his characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence!" cried Pisistratus, clapping his hands to both ears. "I can no
      more alter the fate allotted to each of the personages whom you honour
      with your interest than I can change your own; like you, they must go
      where events lead there, urged on by their own characters and the agencies
      of others. Providence so pervadingly governs the universe, that you cannot
      strike it even out of a book. The author may beget a character, but the
      moment the character comes into action, it escapes from his hands,&mdash;plays
      its own part, and fulfils its own inevitable doom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," said Squills, "it is easy to see, from the phrenological
      development of the organs in those several heads which Pisistratus has
      allowed us to examine, that we have seen no creations of mere fiction, but
      living persons, whose true history has set in movement their various bumps
      of Amativeness, Constructiveness, Acquisitiveness, Idealty, Wonder,
      Comparison, etc. They must act, and they must end, according to the
      influences of their crania. Thus we find in Randal Leslie the predominant
      organs of Constructiveness, Secretiveness, Comparison, and Eventuality,
      while Benevolence, Conscientiousness, Adhesiveness, are utterly nil. Now,
      to divine how such a man must end, we must first see what is the general
      composition of the society in which he moves, in short, what other gases
      are brought into contact with his phlogiston. As to Leonard, and Harley,
      and Audley Egerton, surveying them phrenologically, I should say that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said my father, "Pisistratus has dipped his pen in the ink, and it
      seems to me easier for the wisest man that ever lived to account for what
      others have done than to predict what they should do. Phrenologists
      discovered that Mr. Thurtell had a very fine organ of Conscientiousness;
      yet, somehow or other, that erring personage contrived to knock the brains
      out of his friend's organ of Individuality. Therefore I rise to propose a
      Resolution,&mdash;that this meeting be adjourned till Pisistratus has
      completed his narrative; and we shall then have the satisfaction of
      knowing that it ought, according to every principle of nature, science,
      and art, to have been completed differently. Why should we deprive
      ourselves of that pleasure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I second the motion," said the captain; "but if Levy be not hanged, I
      shall say that there is an end of all poetical justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care of poor Helen," said Blanche, tenderly: "nor, that I would have
      you forget Violante."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pish! and sit down, or they shall both die old maids." Frightened at that
      threat, Blanche, with a deprecating look, drew her stool quietly near me,
      as if to place her two proteges in an atmosphere mesmerized to matrimonial
      attractions; and my mother set hard to work&mdash;at a new frock for the
      baby. Unsoftened by these undue female influences, Pisistratus wrote on at
      the dictation of the relentless Fates. His pen was of iron, and his heart
      was of granite. He was as insensible to the existence of wife and baby as
      if he had never paid a house bill, nor rushed from a nursery at the sound
      of an infant squall. O blessed privilege of Authorship!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is necessary to go somewhat back in the course of this narrative, and
      account to the reader for the disappearance of Violante.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be remembered that Peschiera, scared by the sudden approach of Lord
      L'Estrange, had little time for further words to the young Italian, than
      those which expressed his intention to renew the conference, and press for
      her decision. But the next day, when he re-entered the garden, secretly
      and stealthily, as before, Violante did not appear. And after watching
      round the precincts till dusk, the count retreated, with an indignant
      conviction that his arts had failed to enlist on his side either the heart
      or the imagination of his intended victim. He began now to revolve and to
      discuss with Levy the possibilities of one of those bold and violent
      measures, which were favoured by his reckless daring and desperate
      condition. But Levy treated with such just ridicule any suggestion to
      abstract Violante by force from Lord Lansmere's house, so scouted the
      notions of nocturnal assault, with the devices of scaling windows and
      rope-ladders, that the count reluctantly abandoned that romance of villany
      so unsuited to our sober capital, and which would no doubt have terminated
      in his capture by the police, with the prospect of committal to the House
      of Correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy himself found his invention at fault, and Randal Leslie was called
      into consultation. The usurer had contrived that Randal's schemes of
      fortune and advancement were so based upon Levy's aid and connivance, that
      the young man, with all his desire rather to make instruments of other
      men, than to be himself their instrument, found his superior intellect as
      completely a slave to Levy's more experienced craft, as ever subtle Genius
      of air was subject to the vulgar Sorcerer of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      His acquisition of the ancestral acres, his anticipated seat in
      parliament, his chance of ousting Frank from the heritage of Hazeldean,
      were all as strings that pulled him to and fro, like a puppet in the
      sleek, filbert-nailed fingers of the smiling showman, who could exhibit
      him to the admiration of a crowd, or cast him away into dust and lumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal gnawed his lip in the sullen wrath of a man who bides his hour of
      future emancipation, and lent his brain to the hire of the present
      servitude, in mechanical acquiescence. The inherent superiority of the
      profound young schemer became instantly apparent over the courage of
      Peschiera and the practised wit of the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your sister," said Randal, to the former, "must be the active agent in
      the first and most difficult part of your enterprise. Violante cannot be
      taken by force from Lord Lansmere's,&mdash;she must be induced to leave it
      with her own consent. A female is needed here. Woman can best decoy
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirably said," quoth the count; "but Beatrice has grown restive, and
      though her dowry, and therefore her very marriage with that excellent
      young Hazeldean, depend on my own alliance with my fair kinswoman, she has
      grown so indifferent to my success that I dare not reckon on her aid.
      Between you and me, though she was once very eager to be married, she now
      seems to shrink from the notion; and I have no other hold over her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she not seen some one, and lately, whom she prefers to poor Frank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect that she has; but I know not whom, unless it be that detested
      L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well, well. Interfere with her no further yourself, but have all in
      readiness to quit England, as you had before proposed, as soon as Violante
      be in your power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is in readiness," said the count. "Levy has agreed to purchase a
      famous sailing-vessel of one of his clients. I have engaged a score or so
      of determined outcasts, accustomed to the sea,&mdash;Genoese, Corsicans,
      Sardinians, ex-Carbonari of the best sort,&mdash;no silly patriots, but
      liberal cosmopolitans, who have iron at the disposal of any man's gold. I
      have a priest to perform the nuptial service, and deaf to any fair lady's
      'No.' Once at sea, and wherever I land, Violante will lean on my arm as
      Countess of Peschiera."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Violante," said Randal, doggedly, determined not to yield to the
      disgust with which the count's audacious cynicism filled even him&mdash;"but
      Violante cannot be removed in broad daylight at once to such a vessel, nor
      from a quarter so populous as that in which your sister resides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have thought of that too," said the count; "my emissaries have found me
      a house close by the river, and safe for our purpose as the dungeons of
      Venice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish not to know all this," answered Randal, quickly; "you will
      instruct Madame di Negra where to take Violante.&mdash;my task limits
      itself to the fair inventions that belong to intellect; what belongs to
      force is not in my province. I will go at once to your sister, whom I
      think I can influence more effectually than you can; though later I may
      give you a hint to guard against the chance of her remorse. Meanwhile as,
      the moment Violante disappears, suspicion would fall upon you, show
      yourself constantly in public surrounded by your friends. Be able to
      account for every hour of your time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An alibi?" interrupted the ci-devant solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly so, Baron. Complete the purchase of the vessel, and let the count
      man it as he proposes. I will communicate with you both as soon as I can
      put you into action. To-day I shall have much to do; it will be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Randal left the room, Levy followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you propose to do will be well done, no doubt," quoth the usurer,
      linking his arm in Randal's; "but take care that you don't get yourself
      into a scrape, so as to damage your character. I have great hopes of you
      in public life; and in public life character is necessary,&mdash;that is,
      so far as honour is concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I damage my character!&mdash;and for a Count Peschiera!" said Randal,
      opening his eyes. "I! What do you take me for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron let go his hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This boy ought to rise very high," said he to himself, as he turned back
      to the count.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal's acute faculty of comprehension had long since surmised the truth
      that Beatrice's views and temper of mind had been strangely and suddenly
      altered by some such revolution as passion only can effect; that pique or
      disappointment had mingled with the motive which had induced her to accept
      the hand of his rash young kinsman; and that, instead of the resigned
      indifference with which she might at one time have contemplated any
      marriage that could free her from a position that perpetually galled her
      pride, it was now with a repugnance, visible to Randal's keen eye, that
      she shrank from the performance of that pledge which Frank had so dearly
      bought. The temptations which the count could hold out to her to become
      his accomplice in designs of which the fraud and perfidy would revolt her
      better nature had ceased to be of avail. A dowry had grown valueless,
      since it would but hasten the nuptials from which she recoiled. Randal
      felt that he could not secure her aid, except by working on a passion so
      turbulent as to confound her judgment. Such a passion he recognized in
      jealousy. He had once doubted if Harley were the object of her love; yet,
      after all, was it not probable? He knew, at least, of no one else to
      suspect. If so, he had but to whisper, "Violante is your rival. Violante
      removed, your beauty may find its natural effect; if not, you are an
      Italian, and you will be at least avenged." He saw still more reason to
      suppose that Lord L'Estrange was indeed the one by whom he could rule
      Beatrice, since, the last time he had seen her, she had questioned him
      with much eagerness as to the family of Lord Lansmere, especially as to
      the female part of it. Randal had then judged it prudent to avoid speaking
      of Violante, and feigned ignorance; but promised to ascertain all
      particulars by the time he next saw the marchesa. It was the warmth with
      which she had thanked him that had set his busy mind at work to conjecture
      the cause of her curiosity so earnestly aroused, and to ascribe that cause
      to jealousy. If Harley loved Violante (as Randal himself had before
      supposed), the little of passion that the young man admitted to himself
      was enlisted in aid of Peschiera's schemes. For though Randal did not love
      Violante, he cordially disliked L'Estrange, and would have gone as far to
      render that dislike vindictive, as a cold reasoner, intent upon worldly
      fortunes, will ever suffer mere hate to influence him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the worst," thought Randal, "if it be not Harley, touch the chord of
      jealousy, and its vibration will direct me right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus soliloquizing, he arrived at Madame di Negra's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in reality the marchesa's inquiries as to Lord Lansmere's family had
      their source in the misguided, restless, despairing interest with which
      she still clung to the image of the young poet, whom Randal had no reason
      to suspect. That interest had become yet more keen from the impatient
      misery she had felt ever since she had plighted herself to another. A wild
      hope that she might yet escape, a vague regretful thought that she had
      been too hasty in dismissing Leonard from her presence,&mdash;that she
      ought rather to have courted his friendship, and contended against her
      unknown rival,&mdash;at times drew her wayward mind wholly from the future
      to which she had consigned herself. And, to do her justice, though her
      sense of duty was so defective, and the principles which should have
      guided her conduct were so lost to her sight, still her feelings towards
      the generous Hazeldean were not so hard and blunted but what her own
      ingratitude added to her torment; and it seemed as if the sole atonement
      she could make to him was to find an excuse to withdraw her promise, and
      save him from herself. She had caused Leonard's steps to be watched; she
      had found that he visited at Lord Lansmere's; that he had gone there
      often, and stayed there long. She had learned in the neighbourhood that
      Lady Lansmere had one or two young female guests staying with her. Surely
      this was the attraction&mdash;here was the rival!
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal found Beatrice in a state of mind that answered his purpose; and
      first turning his conversation on Harley, and noting that her countenance
      did not change, by little and little he drew forth her secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said Randal, gravely, "If one whom you honour with a tender thought
      visits at Lord Lansmere's house, you have, indeed, cause to fear for
      yourself, to hope for your brother's success in the object which has
      brought him to England; for a girl of surpassing beauty is a guest in Lord
      Lansmere's house, and I will now tell you that that girl is she whom Count
      Peschiera would make his bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Randal thus spoke, and saw how his listener's brow darkened and her eye
      flashed, he felt that his accomplice was secured. Violante! Had not
      Leonard spoken of Violante, and with such praise? Had not his boyhood been
      passed under her eyes? Who but Violante could be the rival? Beatrice's
      abrupt exclamations, after a moment's pause, revealed to Randal the
      advantage he had gained. And partly by rousing her jealousy into revenge,
      partly by flattering her love with assurances that, if Violante were
      fairly removed from England, were the wife of Count Peschiera, it would be
      impossible that Leonard could remain insensible to her own attractions;
      that he, Randal, would undertake to free her honourably from her
      engagement to Frank Hazeldean, and obtain from her brother the acquittal
      of the debt which had first fettered her hand to that confiding suitor,&mdash;he
      did not quit the marchesa until she had not only promised to do all that
      Randal might suggest, but impetuously urged him to mature his plans, and
      hasten the hour to accomplish them. Randal then walked some minutes musing
      and slow along the streets, revolving the next meshes in his elaborate and
      most subtle web. And here his craft luminously devised its masterpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary, during any interval that might elapse between Violante's
      disappearance and her departure from England, in order to divert suspicion
      from Peschiera (who might otherwise be detained), that some cause for her
      voluntary absence from Lord Lansmere's should be at least assignable; it
      was still more necessary that Randal himself should stand wholly clear
      from any surmise that he could have connived at the count's designs, even
      should their actual perpetrator be discovered or conjectured. To effect
      these objects, Randal hastened to Norwood, and obtained an interview with
      Riccabocca. In seeming agitation and alarm, he informed the exile that he
      had reason to know that Peschiera had succeeded in obtaining a secret
      interview with Violante, and he feared had made a certain favourable
      impression on her mind; and speaking as if with the jealousy of a lover,
      he entreated Riccabocca to authorize Randal's direct proposals to
      Violante, and to require her consent to their immediate nuptials.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Italian was confounded with the intelligence conveyed to him; and
      his almost superstitious fears of his brilliant enemy, conjoined with his
      opinion of the susceptibility to outward attractions common to all the
      female sex, made him not only implicitly credit, but even exaggerate, the
      dangers that Randal intimated. The idea of his daughter's marriage with
      Randal, towards which he had lately cooled, he now gratefully welcomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his first natural suggestion was to go, or send, for Violante, and
      bring her to his own house. This, however, Randal artfully opposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! I know," said he, "that Peschiera has discovered your retreat, and
      surely she would be far less safe here than where she is now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, diavolo! you say the man has seen her where she is now, in spite of
      all Lady Lansmere's promises and Harley's precautions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. Of this Peschiera boasted to me. He effected it not, of course,
      openly, but in some disguise. I am sufficiently, however, in his
      confidence&mdash;any man may be that with so audacious a braggart&mdash;to
      deter him from renewing his attempt for some days. Meanwhile, I or
      yourself will leave discovered some surer home than this, to which you can
      remove, and then will be the proper time to take back your daughter. And
      for the present, if you will send by me a letter to enjoin her to receive
      me as her future bridegroom, it will necessarily divert all thought at
      once from the count; I shall be able to detect by the manner in which she
      receives me, how far the count has overstated the effect he pretends to
      have produced. You can give me also a letter to Lady Lansmere, to prevent
      your daughter coming hither. Oh, sir, do not reason with me. Have
      indulgence for my lover's fears. Believe that I advise for the best. Have
      I not the keenest interest to do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many a man who is wise enough with pen and paper before him, and
      plenty of time wherewith to get up his wisdom, Riccabocca was flurried,
      nervous, and confused when that wisdom was called upon for any ready
      exertion. From the tree of knowledge he had taken grafts enough to serve
      for a forest; but the whole forest could not spare him a handy
      walking-stick. The great folio of the dead Machiavelli lay useless before
      him,&mdash;the living Machiavelli of daily life stood all puissant by his
      side. The Sage was as supple to the Schemer as the Clairvoyant is to the
      Mesmerist; and the lean slight fingers of Randal actually dictated almost
      the very words that Riccabocca wrote to his child and her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher would have liked to consult his wife; but he was ashamed
      to confess that weakness. Suddenly he remembered Harley, and said, as
      Randal took up the letters which Riccabocca had indited,
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, that will give us time; and I will send to Lord L'Estrange and
      talk to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My noble friend," replied Randal, mournfully, "may I entreat you not to
      see Lord L'Estrange until at least I have pleaded my cause to your
      daughter,&mdash;until, indeed, she is no longer under his father's roof?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I presume that you are sincere when you deign to receive me as a
      son-in-law, and because I am sure that Lord L'Estrange would hear with
      distaste of your disposition in my favour. Am I not right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And though his arguments would fail with a man of your honour and
      discernment, they might have more effect on the young mind of your child.
      Think, I beseech you, the more she is set against me, the more accessible
      she may be to the arts of Peschiera. Speak not, therefore, I implore you,
      to Lord L'Estrange till Violante has accepted my hand, or at least until
      she is again under your charge; otherwise take back your letter,&mdash;it
      would be of no avail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you are right. Certainly Lord L'Estrange is prejudiced against
      you; or rather, he thinks too much of what I have been, too little of what
      I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can see you, and not do so? I pardon him." After kissing the hand
      which the exile modestly sought to withdraw from that act of homage,
      Randal pocketed the letters; and, as if struggling with emotion, rushed
      from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, O curious reader, if thou wilt heedfully observe to what uses Randal
      Leslie put those letters,&mdash;what speedy and direct results he drew
      forth from devices which would seem to an honest simple understanding the
      most roundabout, wire-drawn wastes of invention,&mdash;I almost fear that
      in thine admiration for his cleverness, thou mayest half forget thy
      contempt for his knavery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the head is very full, it does not do to have the heart very
      empty; there is such a thing as being top-heavy!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Helen and Violante had been conversing together, and Helen had obeyed her
      guardian's injunction, and spoken, though briefly, of her positive
      engagement to Harley. However much Violante had been prepared for the
      confidence, however clearly she had divined that engagement, however
      before persuaded that the dream of her childhood was fled forever, still
      the positive truth, coming from Helen's own lips, was attended with that
      anguish which proves how impossible it is to prepare the human heart for
      the final verdict which slays its future. She did not, however, betray her
      emotion to Helen's artless eyes; sorrow, deep-seated, is seldom
      self-betrayed. But, after a little while, she crept away; and, forgetful
      of Peschiera, of all things that could threaten danger (what danger could
      harm her more!) she glided from the house, and went her desolate way under
      the leafless wintry trees. Ever and anon she paused, ever and anon she
      murmured the same words: "If she loved him, I could be consoled; but she
      does not! or how could she have spoken to me so calmly! how could her very
      looks have been so sad! Heartless! heartless!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came on her a vehement resentment against poor Helen, that
      almost took the character of scorn or hate,&mdash;its excess startled
      herself. "Am I grown so mean?" she said; and tears that humbled her rushed
      to her eyes. "Can so short a time alter one thus? Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie rang at the front gate, inquired for Violante, and, catching
      sight of her form as he walked towards the house, advanced boldly and
      openly. His voice startled her as she leaned against one of the dreary
      trees, still muttering to herself,&mdash;forlorn. "I have a letter to you
      from your father, Signorina," said Randal; "but before I give it to your
      hands, some explanation is necessary. Condescend, then, to hear me."
      Violante shook her head impatiently, and stretched forth her hand for the
      letter. Randal observed her countenance with his keen, cold, searching
      eye; but he still withheld the letter, and continued, after a pause,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that you were born to princely fortunes; and the excuse for my
      addressing you now is, that your birthright is lost to you, at least
      unless you can consent to a union with the man who has despoiled you of
      your heritage,&mdash;a union which your father would deem dishonour to
      yourself and him. Signorina, I might have presumed to love you, but I
      should not have named that love, had your father not encouraged me by his
      assent to my suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante turned to the speaker, her face eloquent with haughty surprise.
      Randal met the gaze unmoved. He continued, without warmth, and in the tone
      of one who reasons calmly, rather than of one who feels acutely,
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man of whom I spoke is in pursuit of you. I have cause to believe
      that this person has already intruded himself upon you. Ah, your
      countenance owns it; you have seen Peschiera? This house is, then, less
      safe than your father deemed it. No house is safe for you but a husband's.
      I offer to you my name,&mdash;it is a gentleman's; my fortune, which is
      small; the participation in my hopes of the future, which are large. I
      place now your father's letter in your hand, and await your answer."
      Randal bowed slightly, gave the letter to Violante, and retired a few
      paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not his object to conciliate Violante's affection, but rather to
      excite her repugnance, or at least her terror,&mdash;we must wait to
      discover why; so he stood apart, seemingly in a kind of self-confident
      indifference, while the girl read the following letter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "My child, receive with favour Mr. Leslie. He has my consent to
   address you as a suitor. Circumstances of which it is needless now
   to inform you render it essential to my very peace and happiness
   that your marriage should be immediate. In a word, I have given my
   promise to Mr. Leslie, and I confidently leave it to the daughter of
   my House to redeem the pledge of her anxious and tender father."
</pre>
    <p>
      The letter dropped from Violante's hand. Randal approached, and restored
      it to her. Their eyes met. Violante recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot marry you," said she, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed?" answered Randal, dryly. "Is it because you cannot love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not expect that you would as yet, and I still persist in my suit. I
      have promised to your father that I would not recede before your first
      unconsidered refusal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go to my father at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he request you to do so in his letter? Look again. Pardon me, but he
      foresaw your impetuosity; and I have another note for Lady Lansmere, in
      which he begs her ladyship not to sanction your return to him (should you
      so wish) until he come or send for you himself. He will do so whenever
      your word has redeemed his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you dare to talk to me thus, and yet pretend to love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal smiled ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pretend but to wed you. Love is a subject on which I might have spoken
      formerly, or may speak hereafter. I give you some little time to consider.
      When I next call, let me hope that we may fix the day for our wedding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be, then, the first daughter of your House who disobeyed a
      father; and you will have this additional crime; that you disobeyed him in
      his sorrow, his exile, and his fall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante wrung her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no choice, no escape?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see none for either. Listen to me. I love you, it is true; but it is
      not for my happiness to marry one who dislikes me, nor for my ambition to
      connect myself with one whose poverty is greater than my own. I marry but
      to keep my plighted faith with your father, and to save you from a villain
      you would hate more than myself, and from whom no walls are a barrier, no
      laws a defence. One person, indeed, might perhaps have preserved you from
      the misery you seem to anticipate with me; that person might defeat the
      plans of your father's foe,&mdash;effect, it might be, terms which could
      revoke his banishment and restore his honours; that person is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange!" repeated Randal, sharply, and watching her pale parted
      lips and her changing colour; "Lord L'Estrange! What could he do? Why did
      you name him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante turned aside. "He saved my father once," said she, feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And has interfered, and trifled, and promised, Heaven knows what, ever
      since: yet to what end? Pooh! The person I speak of your father would not
      consent to see, would not believe if he saw her; yet she is generous,
      noble, could sympathize with you both. She is the sister of your father's
      enemy, the Marchesa di Negra. I am convinced that she has great influence
      with her brother,&mdash;that she has known enough of his secrets to awe
      him into renouncing all designs on yourself; but it is idle now to speak
      of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," exclaimed Violante. "Tell me where she lives&mdash;I will see
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, I cannot obey you; and, indeed, her own pride is now aroused
      by your father's unfortunate prejudices against her. It is too late to
      count upon her aid. You turn from me,&mdash;my presence is unwelcome. I
      rid you of it now. But welcome or unwelcome, later you must endure it&mdash;and
      for life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal again bowed with formal ceremony, walked towards the house, and
      asked for Lady Lansmere. The countess was at home. Randal delivered
      Riccabocca's note, which was very short, implying that he feared Peschiera
      had discovered his retreat, and requesting Lady Lansmere to retain
      Violante, whatever her own desire, till her ladyship heard from him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The countess read, and her lip curled in disdain. "Strange!" said she,
      half to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange!" said Randal, "that a man like your correspondent should fear
      one like the Count di Peschiera. Is that it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said the countess, a little surprised, "strange that any man should
      fear another in a country like ours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Randal, with his low soft laugh; "I fear many men,
      and I know many who ought to fear me; yet at every turn of the street one
      meets a policeman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lady Lansmere. "But to suppose that this profligate foreigner
      could carry away a girl like Violante against her will,&mdash;a man she
      has never seen, and whom she must have been taught to hate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be on your guard, nevertheless, I pray you, madam; 'Where there's a will
      there's a way'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal took his leave, and returned to Madame di Negra's. He stayed with
      her an hour, revisited the count, and then strolled to Limmer's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Randal," said the squire, who looked pale and worn, but who scorned to
      confess the weakness with which he still grieved and yearned for his
      rebellious son, "Randal, you have nothing now to do in London; can you
      come and stay with me, and take to farming? I remember that you showed a
      good deal of sound knowledge about thin sowing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sir, I will come to you as soon as the general election is over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce have you got to do with the general election?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Egerton has some wish that I should enter parliament; indeed,
      negotiations for that purpose are now on foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire shook his head. "I don't like my half-brother's politics."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be quite independent of them," cried Randal, loftily; "that
      independence is the condition for which I stipulate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to hear it; and if you do come into parliament, I hope you'll not
      turn your back on the land?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn my back on the land!" cried Randal, with devout horror. "Oh, sir, I
      am not so unnatural!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the right way to put it," quoth the credulous squire; "it is
      unnatural! It is turning one's back on one's own mother. The land is a
      mother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To those who live by her, certainly,&mdash;a mother," said Randal,
      gravely. "And though, indeed, my father starves by her rather than lives,
      and Rood Hall is not like Hazeldean, still&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your tongue," interrupted the squire; "I want to talk to you. Your
      grandmother was a Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her picture is in the drawing-room at Rood. People think me very like
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said the squire. "The Hazeldeans are generally inclined to be
      stout and rosy, which you are certainly not. But no fault of yours. We are
      all as Heaven made us. However, to the point. I am going to alter my
      will,"&mdash;(said with a choking gulp). "This is the rough draft for the
      lawyers to work upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, pray, sir, do not speak to me on such a subject. I cannot bear to
      contemplate even the possibility of&mdash;of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My death? Ha, ha! Nonsense. My own son calculated on the date of it by
      the insurance-tables. Ha, ha, ha! A very fashionable son, eh! Ha, ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Frank! do not let him suffer for a momentary forgetfulness of right
      feeling. When he comes to be married to that foreign lady, and be a father
      himself, he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father himself!" burst forth the squire. "Father to a swarm of
      sallow-faced Popish tadpoles! No foreign frogs shall hop about my grave in
      Hazeldean churchyard. No, no. But you need not look so reproachful,&mdash;I
      'm not going to disinherit Frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," said Randal, with a bitter curve in the lip that rebelled
      against the joyous smile which he sought to impose on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I shall leave him the life-interest in the greater part of the
      property; but if he marry a foreigner, her children will not succeed,&mdash;you
      will stand after him in that case. But&mdash;now don't interrupt me&mdash;but
      Frank looks as if he would live longer than you, so small thanks to me for
      my good intentions, you may say. I mean to do more for you than a mere
      barren place in the entail. What do you say to marrying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you please," said Randal, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. There's Miss Sticktorights disengaged,&mdash;great heiress. Her
      lands run onto Rood. At one time I thought of her for that graceless puppy
      of mine. But I can manage more easily to make up the match for you.
      There's a mortgage on the property; old Sticktorights would be very glad
      to pay it off. I 'll pay it out of the Hazeldean estate, and give up the
      Right of Way into the bargain. You understand?
    </p>
    <p>
      "So come down as soon as you can, and court the young lady yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal expressed his thanks with much grateful eloquence; and he then
      delicately insinuated, that if the squire ever did mean to bestow upon him
      any pecuniary favours (always without injury to Frank), it would gratify
      him more to win back some portions of the old estate of Rood, than to have
      all the acres of the Sticktorights, however free from any other
      incumbrance than the amiable heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire listened to Randal with benignant attention. This wish the
      country gentleman could well understand and sympathize with. He promised
      to inquire into the matter, and to see what could be done with old
      Thornhill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal here let out that Mr. Thornhill was about to dispose of a large
      slice of the ancient Leslie estate through Levy, and that he, Randal,
      could thus get it at a more moderate price than would be natural, if Mr.
      Thornhill knew that his neighbour the squire would bid for the purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better say nothing about it either to Levy or Thornhill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," said the squire. "No proprietor likes to sell to another
      proprietor, in the same shire, as largely acred as himself: it spoils the
      balance of power. See to the business yourself; and if I can help you with
      the purchase (after that boy is married,&mdash;I can attend to nothing
      before), why, I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal now went to Egerton's. The statesman was in his library, settling
      the accounts of his house-steward, and giving brief orders for the
      reduction of his establishment to that of an ordinary private gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may go abroad if I lose my election," said Egerton, condescending to
      assign to his servant a reason for his economy; "and if I do not lose it,
      still, now I am out of office, I shall live much in private."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I disturb you, sir?" said Randal, entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I have just done."
    </p>
    <p>
      The house-steward withdrew, much surprised and disgusted, and meditating
      the resignation of his own office,&mdash;in order, not like Egerton, to
      save, but to spend. The house steward had private dealings with Baron
      Levy, and was in fact the veritable X. Y. of the "Times," for whom Dick
      Avenel had been mistaken. He invested his wages and perquisites in the
      discount of bills; and it was part of his own money that had (though
      unknown to himself) swelled the last L5,000 which Egerton had borrowed
      from Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have settled with our committee; and, with Lord Lansmere's consent,"
      said Egerton, briefly, "you will stand for the borough, as we proposed, in
      conjunction with myself. And should any accident happen to me,&mdash;that
      is, should I vacate this seat from any cause,&mdash;you may succeed to it,
      very shortly perhaps. Ingratiate yourself with the electors, and speak at
      the public-houses for both of us. I shall stand on my dignity, and leave
      the work of the election to you. No thanks,&mdash;you know how I hate
      thanks. Good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never stood so near to fortune and to power," said Randal, as he slowly
      undressed. "And I owe it but to knowledge,&mdash;knowledge of men, life,
      of all that books can teach us."
    </p>
    <p>
      So his slight thin fingers dropped the extinguisher on the candle, and the
      prosperous Schemer laid himself down to rest in the dark. Shutters closed,
      curtains drawn&mdash;never was rest more quiet, never was room more dark!
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, Harley had dined at his father's. He spoke much to Helen,
      scarcely at all to Violante. But it so happened that when later, and a
      little while before he took his leave, Helen, at his request, was playing
      a favourite air of his, Lady Lausmere, who had been seated between him and
      Violante, left the room, and Violante turned quickly towards Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know the Marchesa di Negra?" she asked, in a hurried voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little. Why do you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my secret," answered Violante, trying to smile with her old
      frank, childlike archness. "But, tell me, do you think better of her than
      of her brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. I believe her heart to be good, and that she is not without
      generous qualities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not induce my father to see her? Would you not counsel him to do
      so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any wish of yours is a law to me," answered Harley, gallantly. "You wish
      your father to see her? I will try and persuade him to do so. Now, in
      return, confide to me your secret. What is your object?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave to return to my Italy. I care not for honours, for rank; and even
      my father has ceased to regret their loss. But the land, the native land&mdash;Oh,
      to see it once more! Oh, to die there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Die! You children have so lately left heaven, that ye talk as if ye could
      return there, without passing through the gates of sorrow, infirmity, and
      age! But I thought you were content with England. Why so eager to leave
      it? Violante, you are unkind to us,&mdash;to Helen, who already loves you
      so well." As Harley spoke, Helen rose from the piano, and approaching
      Violante, placed her hand caressingly on the Italian's shoulder. Violante
      shivered, and shrunk away. The eyes both of Harley and Helen followed her.
      Harley's eyes were very grave and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she not changed&mdash;your friend?" said he, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, lately; much changed. I fear there is something on her mind,&mdash;I
      know not what."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," muttered Harley, "it may be so; but at your age and hers, nothing
      rests on the mind long. Observe, I say the mind,&mdash;the heart is more
      tenacious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen sighed softly, but deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And therefore," continued Harley, half to himself, "we can detect when
      something is on the mind,&mdash;some care, some fear, some trouble. But
      when the heart closes over its own more passionate sorrow, who can
      discover, who conjecture? Yet you at least, my pure, candid Helen,&mdash;you
      might subject mind and heart alike to the fabled window of glass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" cried Helen, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes! Do not let me think that you have one secret I may not know, or
      one sorrow I may not share. For, in our relationship, that would be
      deceit."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand with more than usual tenderness as he spoke, and
      shortly afterwards left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all that night Helen felt like a guilty thing,&mdash;more wretched
      even than Violante.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early the next morning, while Violante was still in her room, a letter
      addressed to her came by the post. The direction was in a strange hand.
      She opened it, and read, in Italian, what is thus translated:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   I would gladly see you, but I cannot call openly at the house in
   which you live. Perhaps I may have it in my power to arrange family
   dissensions,&mdash;to repair any wrongs your father may have sustained.
   Perhaps I may be enabled to render yourself an essential service.
   But for all this it is necessary that we should meet and confer
   frankly. Meanwhile time presses, delay is forbidden. Will you meet
   me, an hour after noon, in the lane, just outside the private gate
   of your gardens? I shall be alone, and you cannot fear to meet one
   of your own sex, and a kinswoman. Ah, I so desire to see you!
   Come, I beseech you.

                         BEATRICE.
</pre>
    <p>
      Violante read, and her decision was taken. She was naturally fearless, and
      there was little that she would not have braved for the chance of serving
      her father. And now all peril seemed slight in comparison with that which
      awaited her in Randal's suit, backed by her father's approval. Randal had
      said that Madame di Negra alone could aid her in escape from himself.
      Harley had said that Madame di Negra had generous qualities; and who but
      Madame di Negra would write herself a kinswoman, and sign herself
      "Beatrice"?
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before the appointed hour, she stole unobserved through the
      trees, opened the little gate, and found herself in the quiet, solitary
      lane. In a few minutes; a female figure came up, with a quick, light step;
      and throwing aside her veil, said, with a sort of wild, suppressed energy,
      "It is you! I was truly told. Beautiful! beautiful! And oh! what youth and
      what bloom!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice dropped mournfully; and Violante, surprised by the tone, and
      blushing under the praise, remained a moment silent; then she said, with
      some hesitation,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, I presume, the Marchesa di Negra? And I have heard of you enough
      to induce me to trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of me! From whom?" asked Beatrice, almost fiercely. "From Mr Leslie, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on; why falter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From no one else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice sighed heavily, and let fall her veil. Some foot-passengers now
      came up the lane; and seeing two ladies, of mien so remarkable, turned
      round, and gazed curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We cannot talk here," said Beatrice, impatiently; "and I have so much to
      say, so much to know. Trust me yet more; it is for yourself I speak. My
      carriage waits yonder. Come home with me,&mdash;I will not detain you an
      hour; and I will bring you back."
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposition startled Violante. She retreated towards the gate with a
      gesture of dissent. Beatrice laid her hand on the girl's arm, and again
      lifting her veil, gazed at her with a look half of scorn, half of
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, too, would once have recoiled from one step beyond the formal line by
      which the world divides liberty from woman. Now see how bold I am. Child,
      child, do not trifle with your destiny. You may never again have the same
      occasion offered to you. It is not only to meet you that I am here; I must
      know something of you,&mdash;something of your heart. Why shrink? Is not
      the heart pure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante made no answer; but her smile, so sweet and so lofty, humbled the
      questioner it rebuked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may restore to Italy your father," said Beatrice, with an altered
      voice. "Come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante approached, but still hesitatingly. "Not by union with your
      brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dread that so much then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dread it? No. Why should I dread what is in my power to reject. But if
      you can really restore my father, and by nobler means, you may save me for&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante stopped abruptly; the marchesa's eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save you for&mdash;ah! I can guess what you leave unsaid. But come, come!
      more strangers, see; you shall tell me all at my own house. And if you can
      make one sacrifice, why, I will save you all else. Come, or farewell
      forever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante placed her hand in Beatrice's, with a frank confidence that
      brought the accusing blood into the marchesa's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are women both," said Violante; "we descend from the same noble House;
      we have knelt alike to the same Virgin Mother; why should I not believe
      and trust you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" muttered Beatrice, feebly; and she moved on, with her head
      bowed on her breast, and all the pride of her step was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached a carriage that stood by the angle of the road. Beatrice
      spoke a word apart to the driver, who was an Italian, in the pay of the
      count; the man nodded, and opened the carriage door. The ladies entered.
      Beatrice pulled down the blinds; the man remounted his box, and drove on
      rapidly. Beatrice, leaning back, groaned aloud. Violante drew nearer to
      her side. "Are you in pain?" said she, with her tender, melodious voice;
      "or can I serve you as you would serve me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Child, give me your hand, and be silent while I look at you. Was I ever
      so fair as this? Never! And what deeps&mdash;what deeps roll between her
      and me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said this as of some one absent, and again sank into silence; but
      continued still to gaze on Violante, whose eyes, veiled by their long
      fringes, drooped beneath the gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Beatrice started, exclaiming, "No, it shall not be!" and placed
      her hand on the check-string.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall not be?" asked Violante, surprised by the cry and the action.
      Beatrice paused; her breast heaved visibly under her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay," she said slowly. "As you say, we are both women of the same noble
      House; you would reject the suit of my brother, yet you have seen him; his
      the form to please the eye, his the arts that allure the fancy. He offers
      to you rank, wealth, your father's pardon and recall. If I could remove
      the objections which your father entertains, prove that the count has less
      wronged him than he deems, would you still reject the rank and the wealth
      and the hand of Giulio Franzini?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, yes; were his hand a king's!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, then, as woman to woman&mdash;both, as you say, akin, and sprung
      from the same lineage&mdash;still, then, answer me, answer me, for you
      speak to one who has loved&mdash;Is it not that you love another? Speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know. Nay, not love,&mdash;it was a romance; it is a thing
      impossible. Do not question,&mdash;I cannot answer." And the broken words
      were choked by sudden tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice's face grew hard and pitiless. Again she lowered her veil, and
      withdrew her hand from the check-string; but the coachman had felt the
      touch, and halted. "Drive on," said Beatrice, "as you were directed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were now long silent,&mdash;Violante with great difficulty recovering
      from her emotion, Beatrice breathing hard, and her arms folded firmly
      across her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the carriage had entered London; it passed the quarter in which
      Madame di Negra's house was situated; it rolled fast over a bridge; it
      whirled through a broad thoroughfare, then through defiles of lanes, with
      tall blank dreary houses on either side. On it went, and on, till Violante
      suddenly took alarm. "Do you live so far?" she said, drawing up the blind,
      and gazing in dismay on the strange, ignoble suburb. "I shall be missed
      already. Oh, let us turn back, I beseech you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are nearly there now. The driver has taken this road in order to avoid
      those streets in which we might have been seen together,&mdash;perhaps by
      my brother himself. Listen to me, and talk of-of the lover whom you
      rightly associate with a vain romance. 'Impossible,'&mdash;yes, it is
      impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante clasped her hands before her eyes, and bowed down her head. "Why
      are you so cruel?" said she. "This is not what you promised. How are you
      to serve my father, how restore him to his country? This is what you
      promised!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you consent to one sacrifice, I will fulfil that promise. We are
      arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped before a tall, dull house, divided from other houses
      by a high wall that appeared to enclose a yard, and standing at the end of
      a narrow lane, which was bounded on the one side by the Thames. In that
      quarter the river was crowded with gloomy, dark-looking vessels and craft,
      all lying lifeless under the wintry sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver dismounted and rang the bell. Two swarthy Italian faces
      presented themselves at the threshold. Beatrice descended lightly, and
      gave her hand to Violante. "Now, here we shall be secure," said she; "and
      here a few minutes may suffice to decide your fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed on Violante, who, now waking to suspicion, to alarm,
      looked fearfully round the dark and dismal hall, Beatrice turned: "Let the
      carriage wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian who received the order bowed and smiled; but when the two
      ladies had ascended the stairs he re-opened the street-door, and said to
      the driver, "Back to the count, and say, 'All is safe.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage drove off. The man who had given this order barred and locked
      the door, and, taking with him the huge key, plunged into the mystic
      recesses of the basement and disappeared. The hall, thus left solitary,
      had the grim aspect of a prison,&mdash;the strong door sheeted with iron,
      the rugged stone stairs, lighted by a high window grimed with the dust of
      years, and jealously barred, and the walls themselves abutting out rudely
      here and there, as if against violence even from within.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was, as we have seen, without taking counsel of the faithful Jemima
      that the sage recluse of Norwood had yielded to his own fears and Randal's
      subtle suggestions, in the concise and arbitrary letter which he had
      written to Violante; but at night, when churchyards give up the dead, and
      conjugal hearts the secrets hid by day from each other, the wise man
      informed his wife of the step he had taken. And Jemima then&mdash;who held
      English notions, very different from those which prevail in Italy, as to
      the right of fathers to dispose of their daughters without reference to
      inclination or repugnance&mdash;so sensibly yet so mildly represented to
      the pupil of Machiavelli that he had not gone exactly the right way to
      work, if he feared that the handsome count had made some impression on
      Violante, and if he wished her to turn with favour to the suitor he
      recommended,&mdash;that so abrupt a command could only chill the heart,
      revolt the will, and even give to the audacious Peschiera some romantic
      attraction which he had not before possessed,&mdash;as effectually to
      destroy Riccabocca's sleep that night. And the next day he sent Giacomo to
      Lady Lansmere's with a very kind letter to Violante and a note to the
      hostess, praying the latter to bring his daughter to Norwood for a few
      hours, as he much wished to converse with both. It was on Giacomo's
      arrival at Knightsbridge that Violante's absence was discovered. Lady
      Lansmere, ever proudly careful of the world and its gossip, kept Giacomo
      from betraying his excitement to her servants, and stated throughout the
      decorous household that the young lady had informed her she was going to
      visit some friends that morning, and had no doubt gone through the garden
      gate, since it was found open; the way was more quiet there than by the
      high-road, and her friends might have therefore walked to meet her by the
      lane. Lady Lansmere observed that her only surprise was that Violante had
      gone earlier than she had expected. Having said this with a composure that
      compelled belief, Lady Lansmere ordered the carriage, and, taking Giacomo
      with her, drove at once to consult her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley's quick intellect had scarcely recovered from the shock upon his
      emotions before Randal Leslie was announced. "Ah," said Lady Lansmere,
      "Mr. Leslie may know something. He came to her yesterday with a note from
      her father. Pray let him enter."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Austrian prince approached Harley. "I will wait in the next room," he
      whispered. "You may want me if you have cause to suspect Peschiera in all
      this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Lansmere was pleased with the prince's delicacy, and, glancing at
      Leonard, said, "Perhaps you, too, sir, may kindly aid us, if you would
      retire with the prince. Mr. Leslie may be disinclined to speak of affairs
      like these, except to Harley and myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, madam, but beware of Mr. Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door at one end of the room closed on the prince and Leonard,
      Randal entered at the other, seemingly much agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just been to your house, Lady Lansmere. I heard you were here;
      pardon me if I have followed you. I have called at Knightsbridge to see
      Violante, learned that she had left you. I implore you to tell me how or
      wherefore. I have the right to ask: her father has promised me her hand."
      Harley's falcon eye had brightened tip at Randal's entrance. It watched
      steadily the young man's face. It was clouded for a moment by his knitted
      brows at Randal's closing words; but he left it to Lady Lansmere to reply
      and explain. This the countess did briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal clasped his hands. "And has she not gone to her father's? Are you
      sure of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her father's servant has just come from Norwood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am to blame for this! It is my rash suit, her fear of it, her
      aversion! I see it all!" Randal's voice was hollow with remorse and
      despair. "To save her from Peschiera, her father insisted on her immediate
      marriage with myself. His orders were too abrupt, my own wooing too
      unwelcome. I knew her high spirit; she has fled to escape from me. But
      whither, if not to Norwood,&mdash;oh, whither? What other friends has she,
      what relations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You throw a new light on this mystery," said Lady Lansmere; "perhaps she
      may have gone to her father's after all, and the servant may have crossed,
      but missed her on the way. I will drive to Norwood at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so,&mdash;do; but if she be not there, be careful not to alarm
      Riccabocca with the news of her disappearance. Caution Giacomo not to do
      so. He would only suspect Peschiera, and be hurried to some act of
      violence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not you, then, suspect Peschiera, Mr. Leslie?" asked Harley, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! is it possible? Yet, no. I called on him this morning with Frank
      Hazeldean, who is to marry his sister. I was with him till I went on to
      Knightsbridge, at the very time of Violante's disappearance. He could not
      then have been a party to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw Violante yesterday. Did you speak to her of Madame di Negra?"
      asked Harley, suddenly recalling the questions respecting the marchesa
      which Violante had addressed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, Randal felt that he changed countenance. "Of Madame
      di Negra? I do not think so. Yet I might. Oh, yes, I remember now. She
      asked me the marchesa's address; I would not give it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The address is easily found. Can she have gone to the marchesa's house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will run there, and see," cried Randal, starting up. "And I with you.
      Stay, my dear mother. Proceed, as you propose, to Norwood, and take Mr.
      Leslie's advice. Spare our friend the news of his daughter's loss&mdash;if
      lost she be&mdash;till she is restored to him. He can be of no use mean
      while. Let Giacomo rest here; I may want him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley then passed into the next room, and entreated the prince and
      Leonard to await his return, and allow Giacomo to stay in the same room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then went quickly back to Randal. Whatever might be his fears or
      emotions, Harley felt that he had need of all his coolness of judgment and
      presence of mind. The occasion made abrupt demand upon powers which had
      slept since boyhood, but which now woke with a vigour that would have made
      even Randal tremble, could he have detected the wit, the courage, the
      electric energies, masked under that tranquil self-possession. Lord
      L'Estrange and Randal soon reached the marchesa's house, and learned that
      she had been out since morning in one of Count Peschiera's carriages.
      Randal stole an alarmed glance at Harley's face. Harley did not seem to
      notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. Leslie, what do you advise next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at a loss. Ah, perhaps, afraid of her father, knowing how despotic
      is his belief in paternal rights, and how tenacious he is of his word once
      passed, as it has been to me, she may have resolved to take refuge in the
      country, perhaps at the Casino, or at Mrs. Dale's, or Mrs. Hazeldean's. I
      will hasten to inquire at the coach-office. Meanwhile, you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind me, Mr. Leslie. Do what you think best. But, if your surmises
      be just, you must have been a very rude wooer to the high-born lady you
      aspired to win."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so; but perhaps an unwelcome one. If she has indeed fled from me,
      need I say that my suit will be withdrawn at once? I am not a selfish
      lover, Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I a vindictive man. Yet, could I discover who has conspired against
      this lady, a guest under my father's roof, I would crush him into the mire
      as easily as I set my foot upon this glove. Good-day to you, Mr. Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal stood still for a few moments as Harley strided on; then his lip
      sneered as it muttered, "Insolent! But does he love her? If so, I am
      avenged already."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harley went straight to Peschiera's hotel. He was told that the count had
      walked out with Mr. Frank Hazeldean and some other gentlemen who had
      breakfasted with him. He had left word, in case any one called, that he
      had gone to Tattersall's to look at some horses that were for sale. To
      Tattersall's went Harley. The count was in the yard leaning against a
      pillar, and surrounded by fashionable friends. Lord L'Estrange paused,
      and, with an heroic effort at self-mastery, repressed his rage. "I may
      lose all if I show that I suspect him; and yet I must insult and fight him
      rather than leave his movements free. Ah, is that young Hazeldean? A
      thought strikes me!" Frank was standing apart from the group round the
      count, and looking very absent and very sad. Harley touched him on the
      shoulder, and drew him aside unobserved by the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Hazeldean, your uncle Egerton is my dearest friend. Will you be a
      friend to me? I want you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow me. Do not let Count Peschiera see us talking together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley quitted the yard, and entered St. James's Park by the little gate
      close by. In a very few words he informed Frank of Violante's
      disappearance and of his reasons for suspecting the count. Frank's first
      sentiment was that of indignant disbelief that the brother of Beatrice
      could be so vile; but as he gradually called to mind the cynical and
      corrupt vein of the count's familiar conversation, the hints to
      Peschiera's prejudice that had been dropped by Beatrice herself, and the
      general character for brilliant and daring profligacy which even the
      admirers of the count ascribed to him, Frank was compelled to reluctant
      acquiescence in Harley's suspicions; and he said, with an earnest gravity
      very rare to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, Lord L'Estrange, if I can assist you in defeating a base and
      mercenary design against this poor young lady, you have but to show me
      how. One thing is clear, Peschicra was not personally engaged in this
      abduction, since I have been with him all day; and&mdash;now I think of it&mdash;I
      begin to hope that you wrong him; for he has invited a large party of us
      to make an excursion with him to Boulogne next week, in order to try his
      yacht, which he could scarcely do if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yacht, at this time of the year! a man who habitually resides at Vienna&mdash;a
      yacht!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spendquick sells it a bargain, on account of the time of year and other
      reasons; and the count proposes to spend next summer in cruising about the
      Ionian Isles. He has some property on those isles, which he has never yet
      visited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long is it since he bought this yacht?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I am not sure that it is already bought,&mdash;that is, paid for.
      Levy was to meet Spendquick this very morning to arrange the matter.
      Spendquick complains that Levy screws him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Hazeldean, you are guiding me through the maze. Where shall I
      find Lord Spendquick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this hour, probably in bed. Here is his card."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. And where lies the vessel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was off Blackwall the other day. I went to see it, 'The Flying
      Dutchman,'&mdash;a fine vessel, and carries guns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough. Now, heed me. There can be no immediate danger to Violante, so
      long as Peschiera does not meet her, so long as we know his movements. You
      are about to marry his sister. Avail yourself of that privilege to keep
      close by his side. Refuse to be shaken off. Make what excuses for the
      present your invention suggests. I will give you an excuse. Be anxious and
      uneasy to know where you can find Madame di Negra."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame di Negra!" cried Frank. "What of her? Is she not in Curzon
      Street?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; she has gone out in one of the count's carriages. In all probability
      the driver of that carriage, or some servant in attendance on it, will
      come to the count in the course of the day; and in order to get rid of
      you, the count will tell you to see this servant, and ascertain yourself
      that his sister is safe. Pretend to believe what the man says, but make
      him come to your lodgings on pretence of writing there a letter for the
      marchesa. Once at your lodgings, and he will be safe; for I shall see that
      the officers of justice secure him. The moment he is there, send an
      express for me to my hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Frank, a little bewildered, "if I go to my lodgings, how can I
      watch the count?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will nor then be necessary. Only get him to accompany you to your
      lodgings, and part with him at the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, stop! you cannot suspect Madame di Negra of connivance in a scheme
      so infamous. Pardon me, Lord L'Estrange; I cannot act in this matter,&mdash;cannot
      even hear you except as your foe, if you insinuate a word against the
      honour of the woman I love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brave gentleman, your hand. It is Madame di Negra I would save, as well
      as my friend's young child. Think but of her, while you act as I entreat,
      and all will go well. I confide in you. Now, return to the count."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank walked back to join Peschiera, and his brow was thoughtful, and his
      lips closed firmly. Harley had that gift which belongs to the genius of
      Action. He inspired others with the light of his own spirit and the force
      of his own will. Harley next hastened to Lord Spendquick, remained with
      that young gentleman some minutes, then repaired to his hotel, where
      Leonard, the prince, and Giacomo still awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come with me, both of you. You, too, Giacomo. I must now see the police.
      We may then divide upon separate missions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear Lord," cried Leonard, "you must have had good news. You seem
      cheerful and sanguine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seem! Nay, I am so! If I once paused to despond&mdash;even to doubt&mdash;I
      should go mad. A foe to baffle, and an angel to save! Whose spirits would
      not rise high, whose wits would not move quick to the warm pulse of his
      heart?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Twilight was dark in the room to which Beatrice had conducted Violante. A
      great change had come over Beatrice. Humble and weeping, she knelt beside
      Violante, hiding her face, and imploring pardon. And Violante, striving to
      resist the terror for which she now saw such cause as no woman-heart can
      defy, still sought to soothe, and still sweetly assured forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice had learned, after quick and fierce questions, which at last
      compelled the answers that cleared away every doubt, that her jealousy had
      been groundless, that she had no rival in Violante. From that moment the
      passions that had made her the tool of guilt abruptly vanished, and her
      conscience startled her with the magnitude of her treachery. Perhaps had
      Violante's heart been wholly free, or she had been of that mere
      commonplace, girlish character which women like Beatrice are apt to
      despise, the marchesa's affection for Peschiera, and her dread of him,
      might have made her try to persuade her young kinswoman at least to
      receive the count's visit,&mdash;at least to suffer him to make his own
      excuses, and plead his own cause. But there had been a loftiness of spirit
      in which Violante had first defied the mareliesa's questions, followed by
      such generous, exquisite sweetness, when the girl perceived how that wild
      heart was stung and maddened, and such purity of mournful candour when she
      had overcome her own virgin bashfulness sufficiently to undeceive the
      error she detected, and confess where her own affections were placed, that
      Beatrice bowed before her as mariner of old to some fair saint that had
      allayed the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have deceived you!" she cried, through her sobs; "but I will now save
      you at any cost. Had you been as I deemed,&mdash;the rival who had
      despoiled all the hopes of my future life,&mdash;I could without remorse
      have been the accomplice I am pledged to be. But now you&mdash;Oh, you, so
      good and so noble&mdash;you can never, be the bride of Peschiera. Nay,
      start not; he shall renounce his designs forever, or I will go myself to
      our emperor, and expose the dark secrets of his life. Return with me quick
      to the home from which I ensnared you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice's hand was on the door while she spoke. Suddenly her face fell,
      her lips grew white; the door was locked from without. She called,&mdash;no
      one answered; the bell-pull in the room gave no sound; the windows were
      high and barred,&mdash;they did not look on the river, nor the street, but
      on a close, gloomy, silent yard, high blank walls all round it; no one to
      hear the cry of distress, rang it ever so loud and sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice divined that she herself had been no less ensnared than her
      companion; that Peschiera, distrustful of her firmness in evil, had
      precluded her from the power of reparation. She was in a house only
      tenanted by his hirelings. Not a hope to save Violante from a fate that
      now appalled her seemed to remain. Thus, in incoherent self-reproaches and
      frenzied tears, Beatrice knelt beside her victim, communicating more and
      more the terrors that she felt, as the hours rolled on, and the room
      darkened, till it was only by the dull lamp which gleamed through the
      grimy windows from the yard without, that each saw the face of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night came on; they heard a clock from some distant church strike the
      hours. The dim fire had long since burned out, and the air became
      intensely cold. No one broke upon their solitude,&mdash;not a voice was
      heard in the house. They felt neither cold nor hunger,&mdash;they felt but
      the solitude, and the silence, and the dread of something that was to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, about midnight, a bell rang at the street door; then there was
      the quick sound of steps, of sullen bolts withdrawn, of low, murmured
      voices. Light streamed through the chinks of the door to the apartment,
      the door itself opened. Two Italians bearing tapers entered, and the Count
      di Peschiera followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice sprang up, and rushed towards her brother. He laid his hand
      gently on her lips, and motioned to the Italians to withdraw. They placed
      the lights on the table, and vanished without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peschiera then, putting aside his sister, approached Violante.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair kinswoman," said he, with an air of easy but resolute assurance,
      "there are things which no man can excuse, and no woman can pardon, unless
      that love, which is beyond all laws, suggests excuse for the one, and
      obtains pardon for the other. In a word, I have sworn to win you, and I
      have had no opportunities to woo. Fear not; the worst that can befall you
      is to be my bride! Stand aside, my sister, stand aside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giulio Franzini, I stand between you and her; you shall strike me to the
      earth before you can touch even the hem of her robe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, my sister! you turn against me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And unless you instantly retire and leave her free, I will unmask you to
      the emperor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too late, mon enfant! You will sail with us. The effects you may need for
      the voyage are already on board. You will be witness to our marriage, and
      by a holy son of the Church. Then tell the emperor what you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a light and sudden exertion of his strength, the count put away
      Beatrice, and fell on his knee before Violante, who, drawn to her full
      height, death-like pale, but untrembling, regarded him with unutterable
      disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You scorn me now," said he, throwing into his features an expression of
      humility and admiration, "and I cannot wonder at it. But, believe me, that
      until the scorn yield to a kinder sentiment, I will take no advantage of
      the power I have gained over your fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Power!" said Violante, haughtily. "You have ensnared me into this house,
      you have gained the power of a day; but the power over my fate,&mdash;no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that your friends have discovered your disappearance, and are on
      your track. Fair one, I provide against your friends, and I defy all the
      laws and police of England. The vessel that will bear you from these
      shores waits in the river hard by. Beatrice, I warn you,&mdash;be still,
      unhand me. In that vessel will be a priest who shall join our hands, but
      not before you will recognize the truth, that she who flies with Giulio
      Peschiera must become his wife or quit him as the disgrace of her House,
      and the scorn of her sex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O villain! villain!" cried Beatrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peste, my sister, gentler words. You, too, would marry. I tell no tales
      of you. Signorina, I grieve to threaten force. Give me your hand; we must
      be gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante eluded the clasp that would have profaned her, and darting across
      the room, opened the door, and closed it hastily behind her. Beatrice
      clung firmly to the count to detain him from pursuit. But just without the
      door, close, as if listening to what passed within, stood a man wrapped
      from head to foot in a large boat cloak. The ray of the lamp that beamed
      on the man glittered on the barrel of a pistol which he held in his right
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hist!" whispered the man in English, and passing his arm round her; "in
      this house you are in that ruffian's power; out of it, safe. Ah, I am by
      your side,&mdash;I, Violante!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice thrilled to Violante's heart. She started, looked up, but
      nothing was seen of the man's face, what with the hat and cloak, save a
      mass of raven curls, and a beard of the same hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The count now threw open the door, dragging after him his sister, who
      still clung round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, that is well!" he cried to the man, in Italian. "Bear the lady after
      me, gently; but if she attempt to cry out, why, force enough to silence
      her, not more. As for you, Beatrice, traitress that you are, I could
      strike you to the earth, but&mdash;No, this suffices." He caught his
      sister in his arms as he spoke, and regardless of her cries and struggles,
      sprang down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall was crowded with fierce, swarthy men. The count turned to one of
      them, and whispered; in an instant the marchesa was seized and gagged. The
      count cast a look over his shoulder; Violante was close behind, supported
      by the man to whom Peschiera had consigned her, and who was pointing to
      Beatrice, and appeared warning Violante against resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante was silent, and seemed resigned. Peschiera smiled cynically, and,
      preceded by some of his hirelings, who held torches, descended a few steps
      that led to an abrupt landing-place between the hall and the basement
      story. There a small door stood open, and the river flowed close by. A
      boat was moored on the bank, round which grouped four men, who had the air
      of foreign sailors. At the appearance of Peschiera, three of these men
      sprang into the boat, and got ready their oars. The fourth carefully
      re-adjusted a plank thrown from the boat to the wharf, and offered his arm
      obsequiously to Peschiera. The count was the first to enter, and, humming
      a gay opera air, took his place by the helm. The two females were next
      lifted in, and Violante felt her hand pressed almost convulsively by the
      man who stood by the plank. The rest followed, and in another minute the
      boat bounded swiftly over the waves towards a vessel that lay several
      furlongs adown the river, and apart from all the meaner craft that crowded
      the stream. The stars struggled pale through the foggy atmosphere; not a
      word was heard within the boat,&mdash;no sound save the regular splash of
      the oars. The count paused from his lively tune, and gathering round him
      the ample fold of his fur pelisse, seemed absorbed in thought. Even by the
      imperfect light of the stars, Peschiera's face wore an air of sovereign
      triumph. The result had justified that careless and insolent confidence in
      himself and in fortune, which was the most prominent feature in the
      character of the man, who, both bravo and gamester, had played against the
      world with his rapier in one hand and cogged dice in the other. Violante,
      once in a vessel filled by his own men, was irretrievably in his power.
      Even her father must feel grateful to learn that the captive of Peschiera
      had saved name and repute in becoming Peschiera's wife. Even the pride of
      sex in Violante herself must induce her to confirm what Peschiera, of
      course, intended to state,&mdash;namely, that she was a willing partner in
      a bridegroom's schemes of flight towards the altar rather than the poor
      victim of a betrayer, and receiving his hand but from his mercy. He saw
      his fortune secured, his success envied, his very character rehabilitated
      by his splendid nuptials. Ambition began to mingle with his dreams of
      pleasure and pomp. What post in the Court or the State too high for the
      aspirations of one who had evinced the most incontestable talent for
      active life,&mdash;the talent to succeed in all that the will had
      undertaken? Thus mused the count, half-forgetful of the present, and
      absorbed in the golden future, till he was aroused by a loud hail from the
      vessel and the bustle on board the boat, as the sailors caught at the rope
      flung forth to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then rose and moved towards Violante. But the man who was still in
      charge of her passed the count lightly, half-leading, half-carrying his
      passive prisoner. "Pardon, Excellency," said the man, in Italian, "but the
      boat is crowded, and rocks so much that your aid would but disturb our
      footing." Before Peschiera could reply, Violante was already on the steps
      of the vessel, and the count paused till, with elated smile, he saw her
      safely standing on the deck. Beatrice followed, and then Peschiera
      himself; but when the Italians in his train also thronged towards the
      sides of the boat, two of the sailors got before them, and let go the
      rope, while the other two plied their oars vigorously, and pulled back
      towards shore. The Italians burst into an amazed and indignant volley of
      execrations. "Silence," said the sailor who had stood by the plank, "we
      obey orders. If you are not quiet, we shall upset the boat. We can swim;
      Heaven and Monsignore San Giacomo pity you if you cannot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, as Peschiera leaped upon deck, a flood of light poured upon him
      from lifted torches. That light streamed full on the face and form of a
      man of commanding stature, whose arm was around Violante, and whose dark
      eyes flashed upon the count more luminously than the torches. On one side
      this man stood the Austrian prince; on the other side (a cloak, and a
      profusion of false dark locks, at his feet) stood Lord L'Estrange, his
      arms folded, and his lips curved by a smile in which the ironical humour
      native to the man was tempered with a calm and supreme disdain. The count
      strove to speak, but his voice faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      All around him looked ominous and hostile. He saw many Italian faces, but
      they scowled at him with vindictive hate; in the rear were English
      mariners, peering curiously over the shoulders of the foreigners, and with
      a broad grin on their open countenances. Suddenly, as the count thus stood
      perplexed, cowering, stupefied, there burst from all the Italians present
      a hoot of unutterable scorn, "Il traditore! il traditore!" (the traitor!
      the traitor!)
    </p>
    <p>
      The count was brave, and at the cry he lifted his head with a certain
      majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Harley, raising his hand as if to silence the hoot, came
      forth from the group by which he had been hitherto standing, and towards
      him the count advanced with a bold stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What trick is this?" he said, in French, fiercely. "I divine that it is
      you whom I can single out for explanation and atonement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardieu, Monsieur le Comte," answered Harley, in the same language, which
      lends itself so well to polished sarcasm and high-bred enmity, "let us
      distinguish. Explanation should come from me, I allow; but atonement I
      have the honour to resign to yourself. This vessel&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is mine!" cried the count. "Those men, who insult me, should be in my
      pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The men in your pay, Monsieur le Comte, are on shore, drinking success to
      your voyage. But, anxious still to procure you the gratification of being
      amongst your own countrymen, those whom I have taken into my pay are still
      better Italians than the pirates whose place they supply; perhaps not such
      good sailors; but then I have taken the liberty to add to the equipment of
      a vessel which cost me too much to risk lightly, some stout English
      seamen, who are mariners more practised than even your pirates. Your grand
      mistake, Monsieur le Comte, is in thinking that the 'Flying Dutchman' is
      yours. With many apologies for interfering with your intention to purchase
      it, I beg to inform you that Lord Spendquick has kindly sold it to me.
      Nevertheless, Monsieur le Comte, for the next few weeks I place it&mdash;men
      and all&mdash;at your service."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peschiera smiled scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank your Lordship; but since I presume that I shall no longer have
      the travelling companion who alone could make the voyage attractive, I
      shall return to shore, and will simply request you to inform me at what
      hour you can receive the friend whom I shall depute to discuss that part
      of the question yet untouched, and to arrange that the atonement, whether
      it be due from me or yourself, may be rendered as satisfactory as you have
      condescended to make the explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let not that vex you, Monsieur le Comte; the atonement is, in much, made
      already; so anxious have I been to forestall all that your nice sense of
      honour would induce so complete a gentleman to desire. You have ensnared a
      young heiress, it is true; but you see that it was only to restore her to
      the arms of her father. You have juggled an illustrious kinsman out of his
      heritage; but you have voluntarily come on board this vessel, first, to
      enable his Highness the Prince Von &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, of whose rank at
      the Austrian Court you are fully aware, to state to your emperor that he
      himself has been witness of the manner in which you interpreted his
      Imperial Majesty's assent to your nuptials with a child of one of the
      first subjects in his Italian realm; and, next, to commence by an
      excursion to the seas of the Baltic the sentence of banishment which I
      have no doubt will accompany the same act that restores to the chief of
      your House his lands and his honours."
    </p>
    <p>
      The count started.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That restoration," said the Austrian prince, who had advanced to Harley's
      side, "I already guarantee. Disgrace that you are, Giulio Franzini, to the
      nobles of the Empire, I will not leave my royal master till his hand
      strike your name from the roll. I have here your own letters, to prove
      that your kinsman was duped by yourself into the revolt which you would
      have headed as a Catiline, if it had not better suited your nature to
      betray it as a Judas. In ten days from this time, these letters will be
      laid before the emperor and his Council."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you satisfied, Monsieur le Comte," said Harley, "with your atonement
      so far? If not, I have procured you the occasion to render it yet more
      complete. Before you stands the kinsman you have wronged. He knows now,
      that though, for a while, you ruined his fortunes, you failed to sully his
      hearth. His heart can grant you pardon, and hereafter his hand may give
      you alms. Kneel then, Giulio Franzini, kneel at the feet of Alphonso, Duke
      of Serrano."
    </p>
    <p>
      The above dialogue had been in French, which only a few of the Italians
      present understood, and that imperfectly; but at the name with which
      Harley concluded his address to the count, a simultaneous cry from those
      Italians broke forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alphonso the Good! Alphonso the Good! Viva, viva, the good Duke of
      Serrano!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And, forgetful even of the count, they crowded round the tall form of
      Riccabocca, striving who should first kiss his hand, the very hem of his
      garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca's eyes overflowed. The gaunt exile seemed transfigured into
      another and more kingly man. An inexpressible dignity invested him. He
      stretched forth his arms, as if to bless his countrymen. Even that rude
      cry, from humble men, exiles like himself, consoled him for years of
      banishment and penury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, thanks," he continued; "thanks! Some day or other, you will all
      perhaps return with me to the beloved land!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Austrian prince bowed his head, as if in assent to the prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giulio Franzini," said the Duke of Serrano,&mdash;for so we may now call
      the threadbare recluse of the Casino,&mdash;"had this last villanous
      design of yours been allowed by Providence, think you that there is one
      spot on earth on which the ravisher could have been saved from a father's
      arm? But now, Heaven has been more kind. In this hour let me imitate its
      mercy;" and with relaxing brow the duke mildly drew near to his guilty
      kinsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment the Austrian prince had addressed him, the count had
      preserved a profound silence, showing neither repentance nor shame.
      Gathering himself up, he had stood firm, glaring round him like one at
      bay. But as the duke now approached, he waved his hand, and exclaimed,
      "Back, pedant; back; you have not triumphed yet. And you, prating German,
      tell your tales to our emperor. I shall be by his throne to answer,&mdash;if,
      indeed, you escape from the meeting to which I will force you by the way."
      He spoke, and made a rush towards the side of the vessel. But Harley's
      quick wit had foreseen the count's intention, and Harley's quick eye had
      given the signal by which it was frustrated. Seized in the gripe of his
      own watchful and indignant countrymen, just as he was about to plunge into
      the stream, Peschiera was dragged back, pinioned clown. Then the
      expression of his whole countenance changed; the desperate violence of the
      inborn gladiator broke forth. His great strength enabled him to break
      loose more than once, to dash more than one man to the floor of the deck;
      but at length, overpowered by numbers, though still struggling, all
      dignity, all attempt at presence of mind gone, uttering curses the most
      plebeian, gnashing his teeth, and foaming at the mouth, nothing seemed
      left of the brilliant Lothario but the coarse fury of the fierce natural
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then still preserving that air and tone of exquisite imperturbable irony,
      which the highest comedian might have sought to imitate in vain, Harley
      bowed low to the storming count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, Monsieur le Comte, adieu! The vessel which you have honoured me by
      entering is bound to Norway. The Italians who accompany you were sent by
      yourself into exile, and, in return, they now kindly promise to enliven
      you with their society, whenever you feel somewhat tired of your own.
      Conduct the count to his cabin. Gently there, gently. Adieu, Monsieur le
      Comte, adieu! et bon voyage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley turned lightly on his heel, as Peschiera, in spite of his
      struggles, was now fairly carried down to the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A trick for the trickster," said L'Estrange to the Austrian prince. "The
      revenge of a farce on the would-be tragedian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than that,-he is ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And ridiculous," quoth Harley. "I should like to see his look when they
      land him in Norway." Harley then passed towards the centre of the vessel,
      by which, hitherto partially concealed by the sailors, who were now busily
      occupied, stood Beatrice,&mdash;Frank Hazeldean, who had first received
      her on entering the vessel, standing by her side; and Leonard, a little
      apart from the two, in quiet observation of all that had passed around
      him. Beatrice appeared but little to heed Frank; her dark eyes were lifted
      to the dim starry skies, and her lips were moving as if in prayer; yet her
      young lover was speaking to her in great emotion, low and rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, do not think for a moment that we suspect you, Beatrice. I will
      answer for your honour with my life. Oh, why will you turn from me; why
      will you not speak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A moment later," said Beatrice, softly. "Give me one moment yet." She
      passed slowly and falteringly towards Leonard, placed her hand, that
      trembled, on his arm, and led him aside to the verge of the vessel. Frank,
      startled by her movement, made a step as if to follow, and then stopped
      short and looked on, but with a clouded and doubtful countenance. Harley's
      smile had gone, and his eye was also watchful.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a few words that Beatrice spoke, it was but a sentence or so
      that Leonard answered; and then Beatrice extended her hand, which the
      young poet bent over, and kissed in silence. She lingered an instant; and
      even by the starlight, Harley noted the blush that overspread her face.
      The blush faded as Beatrice returned to Frank. Lord L'Estrange would have
      retired,&mdash;she signed to him to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord," she said, very firmly, "I cannot accuse you of harshness to my
      sinful and unhappy brother. His offence might perhaps deserve a heavier
      punishment than that which you inflict with such playful scorn. But
      whatever his penance, contempt now or poverty later, I feel that his
      sister should be by his side to share it. I am not innocent if he be
      guilty; and, wreck though he be, nothing else on this dark sea of life is
      now left to me to cling to. Hush, my Lord! I shall not leave this vessel.
      All that I entreat of you is, to order your men to respect my brother,
      since a woman will be by his side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Marchesa, this cannot be; and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beatrice, Beatrice&mdash;and me!&mdash;our betrothal? Do you forget me?"
      cried Frank, in reproachful agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, young and too noble lover; I shall remember you ever in my prayers.
      But listen. I have been deceived, hurried on, I might say, by others, but
      also, and far more, by my own mad and blinded heart,&mdash;deceived,
      hurried on, to wrong you and to belie myself. My shame burns into me when
      I think that I could have inflicted on you the just anger of your family,
      linked you to my own ruined fortunes,&mdash;my own&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own generous, loving heart!&mdash;that is all I asked!" cried Frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cease, cease! that heart is mine still!" Tears gushed from the Italian's
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Englishman, I never loved you; this heart was dead to you, and it will be
      dead to all else forever. Farewell. You will forget me sooner than you
      think for,&mdash;sooner than I shall forget you, as a friend, as a brother&mdash;if
      brothers had natures as tender and as kind as yours! Now, my Lord, will
      you give me your arm? I would join the count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay; one word, Madame," said Frank, very pale, and through his set
      teeth, but calmly, and with a pride on his brow which had never before
      dignified its habitual careless expression,&mdash;"one word. I may not be
      worthy of you in anything else, but an honest love, that never doubted,
      never suspected, that would have clung to you though all the world were
      against,&mdash;such a love makes the meanest man of worth. One word, frank
      and open. By all that you hold most sacred in your creed, did you speak
      the truth when you said that you never loved me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beatrice bent down her head; she was abashed before this manly nature that
      she had so deceived, and perhaps till then undervalued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon, pardon," she said, in reluctant accents, half-choked by the
      rising of a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her hesitation, Frank's face lighted as if with sudden hope. She raised
      her eyes, and saw the change in him, then glanced where Leonard stood,
      mournful and motionless. She shivered, and added firmly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, pardon; for I spoke the truth, and I had no heart to give. It might
      have been as wax to another,&mdash;it was of granite to you." She paused,
      and muttered inly, "Granite, and&mdash;broken!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank said not a word more. He stood rooted to the spot, not even gazing
      after Beatrice as she passed on, leaning on the arm of Lord L'Estrange. He
      then walked resolutely away, and watched the boat that the men were now
      lowering from the side of the vessel. Beatrice stopped when she came near
      the place where Violante stood, answering in agitated whispers her
      father's anxious questions. As she stopped, she leaned more heavily upon
      Harley. "It is your arm that trembles now, Lord L'Estrange," said she,
      with a mournful smile, and, quitting him ere he could answer, she bowed
      down her head meekly before Violante. "You have pardoned me already," she
      said, in a tone that reached only the girl's ear, "and my last words shall
      not be of the past. I see your future spread bright before me under those
      steadfast stars. Love still; hope and trust. These are the last words of
      her who will soon die to the world. Fair maid, they are prophetic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante shrunk back to her father's breast, and there hid her glowing
      face, resigning her hand to Beatrice, who pressed it to her bosom. The
      marchesa then came back to Harley, and disappeared with him in the
      interior of the vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Harley again came on deck, he seemed much flurried and disturbed. He
      kept aloof from the duke and Violante, and was the last to enter the boat,
      that was now lowered into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he and his companions reached the land, they saw the vessel in
      movement, gliding slowly down the river. "Courage, Leonard, courage!"
      murmured Harley. "You grieve, and nobly. But you have shunned the worst
      and most vulgar deceit in civilized life; you have not simulated love.
      Better that yon poor lady should be, awhile, the sufferer from a harsh
      truth, than the eternal martyr of a flattering lie! Alas, my Leonard! with
      the love of the poet's dream are linked only the Graces; with the love of
      the human heart come the awful Fates!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, poets do not dream when they love. You will learn how the
      feelings are deep in proportion as the fancies are vivid, when you read
      that confession of genius and woe which I have left in your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard turned away. Harley's gaze followed him with inquiring interest,
      and suddenly encountered the soft dark grateful eyes of Violante. "The
      Fates, the Fates!" murmured Harley.

      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are at Norwood in the sage's drawing-room. Violante has long since
      retired to rest. Harley, who had accompanied the father and daughter to
      their home, is still conversing with the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, my dear Duke," said Harley
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, hush! Diavolo, don't call me Duke yet; I am at home here once more
      as Dr. Riccabocca."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear doctor, then, allow me to assure you that you overrate my claim
      to your thanks. Your old friends, Leonard and Frank Hazeldean, must come
      in for their share. Nor is the faithful Giacomo to be forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Continue your explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, I learned, through Frank, that one Baron Levy, a
      certain fashionable money-lender, and general ministrant to the affairs of
      fine gentlemen, was just about to purchase a yacht from Lord Spendquick on
      behalf of the count. A short interview with Spendquick enabled me to
      outbid the usurer, and conclude a bargain by which the yacht became mine,&mdash;a
      promise to assist Spendquick in extricating himself from the claws of the
      money-lender (which I trust to do by reconciling him with his father, who
      is a man of liberality and sense) made Spendquick readily connive at my
      scheme for outwitting the enemy. He allowed Levy to suppose that the count
      might take possession of the vessel; but affecting an engagement, and
      standing out for terms, postponed the final settlement of the
      purchase-money till the next day. I was thus master of the vessel, which I
      felt sure was destined to serve Peschiera's infamous design. But it was my
      business not to alarm the count's suspicions; I therefore permitted the
      pirate crew he had got together to come on board. I knew I could get rid
      of them when necessary. Meanwhile, Frank undertook to keep close to the
      count until he could see and cage within his lodgings the servant whom
      Peschiera had commissioned to attend his sister. If I could but apprehend
      this servant, I had a sanguine hope that I could discover and free your
      daughter before Peschiera could even profane her with his presence. But
      Frank, alas! was no pupil of Machiavelli. Perhaps the count detected his
      secret thoughts under his open countenance, perhaps merely wished to get
      rid of a companion very much in his way; but, at all events, he contrived
      to elude our young friend as cleverly as you or I could have done,&mdash;told
      him that Beatrice herself was at Roehampton, had borrowed the count's
      carriage to go there, volunteered to take Frank to the house, took him.
      Frank found himself in a drawing-room; and after waiting a few minutes,
      while the count went out on pretence of seeing his sister, in pirouetted a
      certain distinguished opera-dancer! Meanwhile the count was fast back on
      the road to London, and Frank had to return as he could. He then hunted
      for the count everywhere, and saw him no more. It was late in the day when
      Frank found me out with this news. I became seriously alarmed. Peschiera
      might perhaps learn my counter-scheme with the yacht, or he might postpone
      sailing until he had terrified or entangled Violante into some&mdash;In
      short, everything was to be dreaded from a man of the count's temper. I
      had no clew to the place to which your daughter was taken, no excuse to
      arrest Peschiera, no means even of learning where he was. He had not
      returned to Mivart's. The Police was at fault, and useless, except in one
      valuable piece of information. They told me where some of your countrymen,
      whom Peschiera's perfidy had sent into exile, were to be found. I
      commissioned Giacomo to seek these men out, and induce them to man the
      vessel. It might be necessary, should Peschiera or his confidential
      servants come aboard, after we had expelled or drawn off the pirate crew,
      that they should find Italians whom they might well mistake for their own
      hirelings. To these foreigners I added some English sailors who had before
      served in the same vessel, and on whom Spendquick assured me I could rely.
      Still these precautions only availed in case Peschiera should resolve to
      sail, and defer till then all machinations against his captives. While,
      amidst my fears and uncertainties, I was struggling still to preserve
      presence of mind, and rapidly discussing with the Austrian prince if any
      other steps could be taken, or if our sole resource was to repair to the
      vessel and take the chance of what might ensue, Leonard suddenly and
      quietly entered my room. You know his countenance, in which joy or sadness
      is not betrayed so much by the evidence of the passions as by variations
      in the intellectual expression. It was but by the clearer brow and the
      steadier eye that I saw he had good tidings to impart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Riccabocca,&mdash;for so, obeying his own request, we will yet
      call the sage,&mdash;"ah, I early taught that young man the great lesson
      inculcated by Helvetius. 'All our errors arise from our ignorance or our
      passions.' Without ignorance and without passions, we should be serene,
      all-penetrating intelligences."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mopsticks," quoth Harley, "have neither ignorance nor passions; but as
      for their intelligence&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" interrupted Riccabocca,&mdash;"proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leonard had parted from us some hours before. I had commissioned him to
      call at Madame di Negra's, and, as he was familiarly known to her
      servants, seek to obtain quietly all the information he could collect,
      and, at all events, procure (what in my haste I had failed to do) the name
      and description of the man who had driven her out in the morning, and make
      what use he judged best of every hint he could gather or glean that might
      aid our researches. Leonard only succeeded in learning the name and
      description of the coachman, whom he recognized as one Beppo, to whom she
      had often given orders in his presence. None could say where he then could
      be found, if not at the count's hotel. Leonard went next to that hotel.
      The man had not been there all the day. While revolving what next he
      should do, his eye caught sight of your intended son-in-law, gliding
      across the opposite side of the street. One of those luminous, inspiring
      conjectures, which never occur to you philosophers, had from the first
      guided Leonard to believe that Randal Leslie was mixed up in this
      villanous affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! He?" cried Riccabocca. "Impossible! For what interest, what object?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell, neither could Leonard; but we had both formed the same
      conjecture. Brief: Leonard resolved to follow Randal Leslie, and track all
      his movements. He did then follow him, unobserved,&mdash;and at a
      distance, first to Audley Egerton's house, then to Eaton Square, thence to
      a house in Bruton Street, which Leonard ascertained to be Baron Levy's.
      Suspicious that, my clear sage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diavolo, yes!" said Riccabocca, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Levy's, Randal stayed till dusk. He then came out, with his cat-like,
      stealthy step, and walked quickly into the neighbourhood of Leicester
      Square. Leonard saw him enter one of those small hotels which are
      appropriated to foreigners. Wild, outlandish fellows were loitering about
      the door and in the street. Leonard divined that the count or the count's
      confidants were there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that can be proved," cried Riccabocca, "if Randal could have been thus
      in communication with Peschiera, could have connived at such perfidy, I am
      released from my promise. Oh, to prove it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proof will come later, if we are on the right track. Let me go on. While
      waiting near the door of this hotel, Beppo himself, the very man Leonard
      was in search of, came forth, and, after speaking a few words to some of
      the loitering foreigners, walked briskly towards Piccadilly. Leonard here
      resigned all further heed of Leslie, and gave chase to Beppo, whom he
      recognized at a glance. Coming up to him, he said quietly, 'I have a
      letter for the Marchesa di Negra. She told me I was to send it to her by
      you. I have been searching for you the whole day.' The man fell into the
      trap, and the more easily, because&mdash;as he since owned in excuse for a
      simplicity which, I dare say, weighed on his conscience more than any of
      the thousand-and-one crimes he may have committed in the course of his
      illustrious life&mdash;he had been employed by the marchesa as a spy upon
      Leonard, and, with an Italian's acumen in affairs of the heart, detected
      her secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What secret?" asked the innocent sage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her love for the handsome young poet. I betray that secret, in order to
      give her some slight excuse for becoming Peschiera's tool. She believed
      Leonard to be in love with your daughter, and jealousy urged her to
      treason. Violante, no doubt, will explain this to you. Well, the man fell
      into the trap. 'Give me the letter, Signor, and quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'It is at a hotel close by; come there, and you will have a guinea for
      your trouble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Leonard walked our gentleman into my hotel; and having taken him into
      my dressing-room, turned the key and there left him. On learning this
      capture, the prince and myself hastened to see our prisoner. He was at
      first sullen and silent; but when the prince disclosed his rank and name
      (you know the mysterious terror the meaner Italians feel for an Austrian
      magnate), his countenance changed, and his courage fell. What with threats
      and what with promises, we soon obtained all that we sought to know; and
      an offered bribe, which I calculated at ten times the amount the rogue
      could ever expect to receive from his spendthrift master, finally bound
      him cheerfully to our service, soul and body. Thus we learned the dismal
      place to which your noble daughter had been so perfidiously ensnared. We
      learned also that the count had not yet visited her, hoping much from the
      effect that prolonged incarceration might have in weakening her spirit and
      inducing her submission. Peschiera was to go to the house at midnight,
      thence to transport her to the vessel. Beppo had received orders to bring
      the carriage to Leicester Square, where Peschiera would join him. The
      count (as Leonard surmised) had taken skulking refuge at the hotel in
      which Randal Leslie had disappeared. The prince, Leonard, Frank (who was
      then in the hotel), and myself held a short council. Should we go at once
      to the house, and, by the help of the police, force an entrance, and
      rescue your daughter? This was a very hazardous resource. The abode,
      which, at various times, had served for the hiding-place of men haunted by
      the law, abounded, according to our informant, in subterranean vaults and
      secret passages, and had more than one outlet on the river. At our first
      summons at the door, therefore, the ruffians within might not only escape
      themselves, but carry off their prisoner. The door was strong, and before
      our entrance could be forced, all trace of her we sought might be lost.
      Again, too, the prince was desirous of bringing Peschiera's guilty design
      home to him,&mdash;anxious to be able to state to the emperor, and to the
      great minister his kinsman, that he himself had witnessed the count's vile
      abuse of the emperor's permission to wed your daughter. In short, while I
      only thought of Violante, the prince thought also of her father's recall
      to his dukedom. Yet, still to leave Violante in that terrible house, even
      for an hour, a few minutes, subjected to the actual presence of Peschiera,
      unguarded save by the feeble and false woman who had betrayed and might
      still desert her&mdash;how contemplate that fearful risk? What might not
      happen in the interval between Peschiera's visit to the house and his
      appearance with his victim on the vessel? An idea flashed on me: Beppo was
      to conduct the count to the house; if I could accompany Beppo in disguise,
      enter the house, myself be present?&mdash;I rushed back to our informant,
      now become our agent; I found the plan still more feasible than I had at
      first supposed. Beppo had asked the count's permission to bring with him a
      brother accustomed to the sea, and who wished to quit England. I might
      personate that brother. You know that the Italian language, in most of its
      dialects and varieties of patois&mdash;Genoese, Piedmontese, Venetian&mdash;is
      as familiar tome as Addison's English! Alas! rather more so. Presto! the
      thing was settled. I felt my heart, from that moment, as light as a
      feather, and my sense as keen as the dart which a feather wings. My plans
      now were formed in a breath, and explained in a sentence. It was right
      that you should be present on board the vessel, not only to witness your
      foe's downfall, but to receive your child in a father's arms. Leonard set
      out to Norwood for you, cautioned not to define too precisely for what
      object you were wanted, till on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank, accompanied by Beppo (for there was yet time for these
      preparations before midnight), repaired to the yacht, taking Giacomo by
      the way. There our new ally, familiar to most of that piratical crew, and
      sanctioned by the presence of Frank, as the count's friend and prospective
      brother-in-law, told Peschiera's hirelings that they were to quit the
      vessel, and wait on shore under Giacomo's auspices till further orders;
      and as soon as the decks were cleared of these ruffians (save a few left
      to avoid suspicion, and who were afterwards safely stowed down in the
      hold), and as soon as Giacomo had lodged his convoy in a public house,
      where he quitted them drinking his health over unlimited rations of grog,
      your inestimable servant quietly shipped on board the Italians pressed
      into the service, and Frank took charge of the English sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The prince, promising to be on board in due time, then left me to make
      arrangements for his journey to Vienna by the dawn. I hastened to a
      masquerade warehouse, where, with the help of an ingenious stagewright
      artificer, I disguised myself into a most thorough-paced-looking
      cut-throat, and then waited the return of my friend Beppo with the most
      perfect confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, if that rascal had played false, all these precautions were lost.
      Cospetto! you were not wise," said the prudent philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely not. You would have been so wise, that by this time your
      daughter would have been lost to you forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not employ the police?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, Because I had already employed them to little purpose; secondly,
      Because I no longer wanted them; thirdly, Because to use them for my final
      catastrophe would be to drag your name, and your daughter's perhaps,
      before a police court,&mdash;at all events, before the tribunal of public
      gossip; and lastly, Because, having decided upon the proper punishment, it
      had too much of equity to be quite consistent with law; and in forcibly
      seizing a man's person, and shipping him off to Norway, my police would
      have been sadly in the way. Certainly my plan rather savours of Lope de
      Vega than of Blackstone. However, you see success atones for all
      irregularities. I resume: Beppo came back in time to narrate all the
      arrangements that had been made, and to inform me that a servant from the
      count had come on board just as our new crew were assembled there, to
      order the boat to be at the place where we found it. The servant it was
      deemed prudent to detain and secure. Giacomo undertook to manage the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am nearly at the close of my story. Sure of my disguise, I got on the
      coach-box with Beppo. The count arrived at the spot appointed, and did not
      even honour myself with a question or glance. 'Your brother?' he said to
      Beppo; 'one might guess that; he has the family likeness. Not a handsome
      race yours! Drive on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "We arrived at the house. I dismounted to open the carriage-door. The
      count gave me one look. 'Beppo says you have known the sea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Excellency, yes. I am a Genoese.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ha! how is that? Beppo is a Lombard.'&mdash;Admire the readiness with
      which I redeemed my blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Excellency, it pleased Heaven that Beppo should be born in Lombardy, and
      then to remove my respected parents to Genoa, at which city they were so
      kindly treated that my mother, in common gratitude, was bound to increase
      its population. It was all she could do, poor woman. You see she did her
      best.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "The count smiled, and said no more. The door opened, I followed him; your
      daughter can tell you the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you risked your life in that den of miscreants! Noble friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Risked my life,&mdash;no; but I risked the count's. There was one moment
      when my hand was on my trigger, and my soul very near the sin of
      justifiable homicide. But my tale is done. The count is now on the river,
      and will soon be on the salt seas, though not bound to Norway, as I had
      first intended. I could not inflict that frigid voyage on his sister. So
      the men have orders to cruise about for six days, keeping aloof from
      shore, and they will then land the count and the marchesa, by boat, on the
      French coast. That delay will give time for the prince to arrive at Vienna
      before the count could follow him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would he have that audacity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do him more justice! Audacity, faith! he does not want for that. But I
      dreaded not his appearance at Vienna with such evidence against him. I
      dreaded his encountering the prince on the road, and forcing a duel,
      before his character was so blasted that the prince could refuse it; and
      the count is a dead shot of course,&mdash;all such men are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will return, and you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! Oh, never fear; he has had enough of me. And now, my dear friend,&mdash;now
      that Violante is safe once more under your own roof; now that my honoured
      mother must long ere this have been satisfied by Leonard, who left us to
      go to her, that our success has been achieved without danger, and, what
      she will value almost as much, without scandal; now that your foe is
      powerless as a reed floating on the water towards its own rot, and the
      Prince Von &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-is perhaps about to enter his carriage on
      the road to Dover, charged with the mission of restoring to Italy her
      worthiest son,&mdash;let me dismiss you to your own happy slumbers, and
      allow me to wrap myself in my cloak, and snatch a short sleep on the sofa,
      till yonder gray dawn has mellowed into riper day. My eyes are heavy, and
      if you stay here three minutes longer, I shall be out of reach of hearing,
      in the land of dreams. Buona notte!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there is a bed prepared for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley shook his head in dissent, and composed himself at length on the
      sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca, bending, wrapped the cloak round his guest, kissed him on the
      forehead, and crept out of the room to rejoin Jemima, who still sat up for
      him, nervously anxious to learn from him those explanations which her
      considerate affection would not allow her to ask from the agitated and
      exhausted Violante. "Not in bed!" cried the sage, on seeing her. "Have you
      no feelings of compassion for my son that is to be? Just, too, when there
      is a reasonable probability that we can afford a son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca here laughed merrily, and his wife threw herself on his
      shoulder, and cried for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sleep fell on the lids of Harley L'Estrange. He started up when his
      host had left him, and paced the apartment, with noiseless but rapid
      strides. All whim and levity had vanished from his face, which, by the
      light of the dawn, seemed death-like pale. On that pale face there was all
      the struggle and all the anguish of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These arms have clasped her," he murmured; "these lips have inhaled her
      breath! I am under the same roof, and she is saved,&mdash;saved evermore
      from danger and from penury, and forever divided from me. Courage,
      courage! Oh, honour, duty; and thou, dark memory of the past,&mdash;thou
      that didst pledge love at least to a grave,&mdash;support, defend me! Can
      I be so weak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was in the wintry skies when Harley stole from the house. No one
      was stirring except Giacomo, who stood by the threshold of the door, which
      he had just unbarred, feeding the house-dog. "Good-day," said the servant,
      smiling. "The dog has not been of much use, but I don't think the padrone
      will henceforth grudge him a breakfast. I shall take him to Italy, and
      marry him there, in the hope of improving the breed of our native Lombard
      dogs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Harley, "you will soon leave our cold shores. May sunshine
      settle on you all!" He paused, and looked up at the closed windows
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The signorina sleeps there," said Giacomo, in a husky voice, "just over
      the room in which you slept."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it," muttered Harley. "An instinct told me of it. Open the gate; I
      must go home. My excuses to your lord, and to all."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned a deaf ear to Giacomo's entreaties to stay till at least the
      signorina was up,&mdash;the signorina whom he had saved. Without trusting
      himself to speak further, he quitted the demesne, and walked with swift
      strides towards London.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harley had not long reached his hotel, and was still seated before his
      untasted breakfast, when Mr. Randal Leslie was announced. Randal, who was
      in the firm belief that Violante was now on the wide seas with Peschiera,
      entered, looking the very personation of anxiety and fatigue. For like the
      great Cardinal Richelieu, Randal had learned the art how to make good use
      of his own delicate and somewhat sickly aspect. The cardinal, when intent
      on some sanguinary scheme requiring unusual vitality and vigour, contrived
      to make himself look a harmless sufferer at death's door. And Randal,
      whose nervous energies could at that moment have whirled him from one end
      of this huge metropolis to the other, with a speed that would have
      outstripped a prize pedestrian, now sank into a chair with a jaded
      weariness that no mother could have seen without compassion. He seemed
      since the last night to have galloped towards the last stage of
      consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you discovered no trace, my Lord? Speak, speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak! certainly. I am too happy to relieve your mind, Mr. Leslie. What
      fools we were! Ha, ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fools&mdash;how?" faltered Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; the young lady was at her father's house all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh? what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is there now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not possible!" said Randal, in the hollow, dreamy tone of a
      somnambulist. "At her father's house, at Norwood! Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal made a desperate and successful effort at self-control. "Heaven be
      praised!" he cried. "And just as I had begun to suspect the count, the
      marchesa; for I find that neither of them slept at home last night; and
      Levy told me that the count had written to him, requesting the baron to
      discharge his bills, as he should be for some time absent from England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Well, that is nothing to us,&mdash;very much to Baron Levy, if he
      executes his commission, and discharges the bills. What! are you going
      already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you ask such a question? How can I stay? I must go to Norwood,&mdash;must
      see Violante with my own eyes! Forgive my emotion&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal snatched at his hat and hurried away. The low scornful laugh of
      Harley followed him as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no more doubt of his guilt than Leonard has. Violante at least
      shall not be the prize of that thin-lipped knave. What strange fascination
      can he possess, that he should thus bind to him the two men I value most,&mdash;Audley
      Egerton and Alphonso di Serrano? Both so wise too!&mdash;one in books, one
      in action. And both suspicious men! While I, so imprudently trustful and
      frank&mdash;Ah, that is the reason; our natures are antipathetic; cunning,
      simulation, falsehood, I have no mercy, no pardon for these. Woe to all
      hypocrites if I were a grand Inquisitor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Richard Avenel," said the waiter, throwing open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley caught at the arm of the chair on which he sat, and grasped it
      nervously, while his eyes became fixed intently on the form of the
      gentleman who now advanced into the room. He rose with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Avenel!" he said falteringly. "Did I hear your name aright? Avenel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard Avenel, at your service, my Lord," answered Dick. "My family is
      not unknown to you; and I am not ashamed of my family, though my parents
      were small Lansmere tradesfolks, and I am&mdash;ahem!&mdash;a citizen of
      the world, and well-to-do!" added Dick, dropping his kid gloves into his
      hat, and then placing the hat on the table, with the air of an old
      acquaintance who wishes to make himself at home. Lord L'Estrange bowed and
      said, as he reseated himself (Dick being firmly seated already), "You are
      most welcome, sir; and if there be anything I can do for one of your name&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my Lord," interrupted Dick. "I want nothing of any man. A bold
      word to say; but I say it. Nevertheless, I should not have presumed to
      call on your Lordship, unless, indeed, you had done me the honour to call
      first at my house, Eaton Square, No. &mdash;&mdash; I should not have
      presumed to call if it had not been on business,&mdash;public business, I
      may say&mdash;NATIONAL business!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley bowed again. A faint smile flitted for a moment to his lip, but,
      vanishing, gave way to a mournful, absent expression of countenance, as he
      scanned the handsome features before him, and, perhaps, masculine and bold
      though they were, still discovered something of a family likeness to one
      whose beauty had once been his ideal of female loveliness; for suddenly he
      stretched forth his hand, and said, with more than his usual cordial
      sweetness, "Business or not business, let us speak to each other as
      friends,&mdash;for the sake of a name that takes me back to Lansmere, to
      my youth. I listen to you with interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Avenel, much surprised by this unexpected kindliness, and touched,
      he knew not why, by the soft and melancholy tone of Harley's voice, warmly
      pressed the hand held out to him; and seized with a rare fit of shyness,
      coloured and coughed and hemmed and looked first down, then aside, before
      he could find the words which were generally ready enough at his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very good, Lord L'Estrange; nothing can be handsomer. I feel it
      here, my Lord," striking his buff waistcoat,&mdash;"I do, 'pon my honour.
      But not to waste your time (time's money), I come to the point. It is
      about the borough of Lansmere. Your family interest is very strong in that
      borough; but excuse me if I say that I don't think you are aware that I
      too have cooked up a pretty considerable interest on the other side. No
      offence,&mdash;opinions are free. And the popular tide runs strong with us&mdash;I
      mean with me&mdash;at the impending crisis,&mdash;that is, at the next
      election. Now, I have a great respect for the earl your father, and so
      have those who brought me into the world&mdash;my father, John, was always
      a regular good Blue,&mdash;and my respect for yourself since I came into
      this room has gone up in the market a very great rise indeed,&mdash;considerable.
      So I should just like to see if we could set our heads together, and
      settle the borough between us two, in a snug private way, as public men
      ought to do when they get together, nobody else by, and no necessity for
      that sort of humbug, which is so common in this rotten old country. Eh, my
      Lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Avenel," said Harley, slowly, recovering himself from the abstraction
      with which he had listened to Dick's earlier sentences, "I fear I do not
      quite understand you; but I have no other interest in the next election
      for the borough of Lansmere than as may serve one whom, whatever be your
      politics, you must acknowledge to be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A humbug!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Avenel, you cannot mean the person I mean. I speak of one of the
      first statesmen of our time,&mdash;of Mr. Audley Egerton, of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A stiff-necked, pompous&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My earliest and dearest friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebuke, though gently said, sufficed to silence Dick for a moment; and
      when he spoke again, it was in an altered tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, my Lord, I am sure. Of course, I can say nothing
      disrespectful of your friend,&mdash;very sorry that he is your friend. In
      that case, I am almost afraid that nothing is to be done. But Mr. Audley
      Egerton has not a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me convince you of this." And Dick pulled out a little book, bound
      neatly in red.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Canvass book, my Lord. I am no aristocrat. I don't pretend to carry a
      free and independent constituency in my breeches' pocket. Heaven forbid!
      But as a practical man of business, what I do is done properly. Just look
      at this book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well kept, eh? Names, promises, inclinations, public opinions, and
      private interests of every individual Lansmere elector! Now, as one man of
      honour to another, I show you this book, and I think you will see that we
      have a clear majority of at least eighty votes as against Mr. Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is your view of the question," said Harley, taking the book and
      glancing over the names catalogued and ticketed therein. But his
      countenance became serious as he recognized many names familiar to his
      boyhood as those of important electors on the Lansmere side, and which he
      now found transferred to the hostile. "But surely there are persons here
      in whom you deceive yourself,&mdash;old friends of my family, stanch
      supporters of our party."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly so. But this new question has turned all old things topsy-turvy.
      No relying on any friend of yours. No reliance except in this book!" said
      Dick, slapping the red cover with calm but ominous emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what I want to propose is this: Don't let the Lansmere interest be
      beaten; it would vex the old earl,&mdash;go to his heart, I am sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Lansmere interest need not be beaten, if you'll put up another
      man instead of this red-tapist. (Beg pardon.) You see I only want to get
      in one man, you want to get in another. Why not? Now, there 's a smart
      youth,&mdash;connection of Mr. Egerton's,&mdash;Randal Leslie. I have no
      objection to him, though he is of your colours. Withdraw Mr. Egerton, and
      I 'll withdraw my second man before it comes to the poll; and so we shall
      halve the borough slick between us. That's the way to do business,&mdash;eh,
      my Lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Randal Leslie! Oh, you wish to bring in Mr. Leslie? But he stands with
      Egerton, not against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Dick, smiling as if to himself, "so I hear; and we could bring
      him in over Egerton without saying a word to you. But all our family
      respect yours, and so I have wished to do the thing handsome and open. Let
      the earl and your party be content with young Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young Leslie has spoken to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as to my coming here. Oh, no, that's a secret,&mdash;private and
      confidential, my Lord. And now, to make matters still more smooth, I
      propose that my man shall be one to your Lordship's own heart. I find you
      have been very kind to my nephew; does you credit, my Lord,&mdash;a
      wonderful young man, though I say it. I never guessed there was so much in
      him. Yet all the time he was in my house, he had in his desk the very
      sketch of an invention that is now saving me from ruin,&mdash;from
      positive ruin,&mdash;Baron Levy, the King's Bench, and almighty smash!
      Now, such a young man ought to be in parliament. I like to bring forward a
      relation,&mdash;that is, when he does one credit; 't is human nature and
      sacred ties&mdash;one's own flesh and blood; and besides, one hand rubs
      the other, and one leg helps on the other, and relations get on best in
      the world when they pull together; that is, supposing that they are the
      proper sort of relations, and pull one on, not down. I had once thought of
      standing for Lansmere myself,&mdash;thought of it very lately. The country
      wants men like me, I know that; but I have an idea that I had better see
      to my own business. The country may, or may not, do without me, stupid old
      thing that she is! But my mill and my new engines&mdash;there is no doubt
      that they cannot do without me. In short, as we are quite alone, and, as I
      said before, there 's no kind of necessity for that sort of humbug which
      exists when other people are present, provide elsewhere for Mr. Egerton,
      whom I hate like poison,&mdash;I have a right to do that, I suppose,
      without offence to your Lordship,&mdash;and the two younkers, Leonard
      Fairfield and Randal Leslie, shall be members for the free and independent
      borough of Lansmere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But does Leonard wish to come into parliament?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, he says not; but that's nonsense. If your Lordship will just signify
      your wish that he should not lose this noble opportunity to raise himself
      in life, and get something handsome out of the nation, I'm sure he owes
      you too much to hesitate,&mdash;'specially when 't is to his own
      advantage. And besides, one of us Avenels ought to be in parliament; and
      if I have not the time and learning, and so forth, and he has, why, it
      stands to reason that he should be the man. And if he can do something for
      me one day&mdash;not that I want anything&mdash;but still a baronetcy or
      so would be a compliment to British Industry, and be appreciated as such
      by myself and the public at large,&mdash;I say, if he could do something
      of that sort, it would keep up the whole family; and if he can't, why,
      I'll forgive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Avenel," said Harley, with that familiar and gracious charm of manner
      which few ever could resist, "Avenel, if as a great personal favour to
      myself&mdash;to me your fellow-townsman (I was born at Lansmere)&mdash;if
      I asked you to forego your grudge against Audley Egerton, whatever that
      grudge be, and not oppose his election, while our party would not oppose
      your nephew's, could you not oblige me? Come, for the sake of dear
      Lansmere, and all the old kindly feelings between your family and mine,
      say 'yes, so shall it be.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Avenel was almost melted. He turned away his face; but there
      suddenly rose to his recollection the scornful brow of Audley Egerton, the
      lofty contempt with which he, then the worshipful Mayor of Screwstown, had
      been shown out of the minister's office-room; and the blood rushing over
      his cheeks, he stamped his foot on the floor, and exclaimed angrily, "No;
      I swore that Audley Egerton should smart for his insolence to me, as sure
      as my name be Richard Avenel; and all the soft soap in the world will not
      wash out that oath. So there is nothing for it but for you to withdraw
      that man, or for me to defeat him. And I would do so, ay,&mdash;and in the
      way that could most gall him,&mdash;if it cost me half my fortune. But it
      will not cost that," said Dick, cooling, "nor anything like it; for when
      the popular tide runs in one's favour, 't is astonishing how cheap an
      election may be. It will cost him enough though, and all for nothing,&mdash;worse
      than nothing. Think of it, my Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, Mr. Avenel. And I say, in my turn, that my friendship is as
      strong as your hate; and that if it costs me, not half, but my whole
      fortune, Audley Egerton shall come in without a shilling of expense to
      himself, should we once decide that he stand the contest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, my Lord,&mdash;very well," said Dick, stiffly, and drawing on
      his kid gloves; "we'll see if the aristocracy is always to ride over the
      free choice of the people in this way. But the people are roused, my Lord.
      The March of Enlightenment is commenced, the Schoolmaster is abroad, and
      the British Lion&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody here but ourselves, my dear Avenel. Is not this rather what you
      call&mdash;humbug?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick started, stared, coloured, and then burst out laughing, "Give us your
      hand again, my Lord. You are a good fellow, that you are. And for your
      sake&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll not oppose Egerton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tooth and nail, tooth and nail!" cried Dick, clapping his hands to his
      ears, and fairly running out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There passed over Harley's countenance that change so frequent to it,&mdash;more
      frequent, indeed, to the gay children of the world than those of
      consistent tempers and uniform habits might suppose. There is many a man
      whom we call friend, and whose face seems familiar to us as our own; yet,
      could we but take a glimpse of him when we leave his presence, and he
      sinks back into his chair alone, we should sigh to see how often the smile
      on the frankest lip is but a bravery of the drill, only worn when on
      parade.
    </p>
    <p>
      What thoughts did the visit of Richard Avenel bequeath to Harley? It were
      hard to define them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his place, an Audley Egerton would have taken some comfort from the
      visit, would have murmured, "Thank Heaven! I have not to present to the
      world that terrible man as my brother-in-law." But probably Harley had
      escaped, in his revery, from Richard Avenel altogether. Even as the
      slightest incident in the daytime causes our dreams at night, but is
      itself clean forgotten, so the name, so the look of the visitor, might
      have sufficed but to influence a vision, as remote from its casual
      suggester as what we call real life is from that life much more real, that
      we imagine, or remember, in the haunted chambers of the brain. For what is
      real life? How little the things actually doing around us affect the
      springs of our sorrow or joy; but the life which our dulness calls
      romance,&mdash;the sentiment, the remembrance, the hope, or the fear, that
      are never seen in the toil of our hands, never heard in the jargon on our
      lips,&mdash;from that life all spin, as the spider from its entrails, the
      web by which we hang in the sunbeam, or glide out of sight into the
      shelter of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must not think," said Harley, rousing himself with a sigh, "either of
      past or present. Let me hurry on to some fancied future. 'Happiest are the
      marriages,' said the French philosopher, and still says many a sage, 'in
      which man asks only the mild companion, and woman but the calm protector.'
      I will go to Helen."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose; and as he was about to lock up his escritoire, he remembered the
      papers which Leonard had requested him to read. He took them from their
      deposit, with a careless hand, intending to carry them with him to his
      father's house. But as his eye fell upon the characters, the hand suddenly
      trembled, and he recoiled some paces, as if struck by a violent blow.
      Then, gazing more intently on the writing, a low cry broke from his lips.
      He reseated himself, and began to read.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Randal&mdash;with many misgivings at Lord L'Estrange's tone, in which he
      was at no loss to detect a latent irony&mdash;proceeded to Norwood. He
      found Riccabocca exceedingly cold and distant; but he soon brought that
      sage to communicate the suspicions which Lord L'Estrange had instilled
      into his mind, and these Randal was as speedily enabled to dispel. He
      accounted at once for his visits to Levy and Peschiera. Naturally he had
      sought Levy, an acquaintance of his own,&mdash;nay, of Audley Egerton's,&mdash;but
      whom he knew to be professionally employed by the count. He had succeeded
      in extracting from the baron Peschiera's suspicious change of lodgment
      from Mivart's Hotel to the purlieus of Leicester Square; had called there
      on the count, forced an entrance, openly accused him of abstracting
      Violante; high words had passed between them,&mdash;even a challenge.
      Randal produced a note from a military friend of his, whom he had sent to
      the count an hour after quitting the hotel. This note stated that
      arrangements were made for a meeting near Lord's Cricket Ground, at seven
      o'clock the next morning. Randal then submitted to Riccabocca another
      formal memorandum from the same warlike friend, to the purport that Randal
      and himself had repaired to the ground, and no count had been forthcoming.
      It must be owned that Randal had taken all suitable precautions to clear
      himself. Such a man is not to blame for want of invention, if he be
      sometimes doomed to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, then, much alarmed," continued Randal, "hastened to Baron Levy, who
      informed me that the count had written him word that he should be for some
      time absent from England. Rushing thence, in despair, to your friend Lord
      L'Estrange, I heard that your daughter was safe with you. And though, as I
      have just proved, I would have risked my life against so notorious a
      duellist as the count, on the mere chance of preserving Violante from his
      supposed designs, I am rejoiced to think that she had no need of my
      unskilful arm. But how and why can the count have left England after
      accepting a challenge? A man so sure of his weapon, too,&mdash;reputed to
      be as fearless of danger as he is blunt in conscience. Explain,&mdash;you
      who know mankind so well,&mdash;explain. I cannot." The philosopher could
      not resist the pleasure of narrating the detection and humiliation of his
      foe, the wit, ingenuity, and readiness of his friend. So Randal learned,
      by little and little, the whole drama of the preceding night. He saw,
      then, that the exile had all reasonable hope of speedy restoration to rank
      and wealth. Violante, indeed; would be a brilliant prize,&mdash;too
      brilliant, perhaps, for Randal, but not to be sacrificed without an
      effort. Therefore wringing convulsively the hand of his meditated
      father-in-law, and turning away his head as if to conceal his emotions,
      the ingenuous young suitor faltered forth that now Dr. Riccabocca was so
      soon to vanish into the Duke di Serrano, he&mdash;Randal Leslie of Rood,
      born a gentleman, indeed, but of fallen fortunes&mdash;had no right to
      claim the promise which had been given to him while a father had cause to
      fear for a daughter's future; with the fear ceased the promise. Alight
      Heaven bless father and daughter both!
    </p>
    <p>
      This address touched both the heart and honour of the exile. Randal Leslie
      knew his man. And though, before Randal's visit, Riccabocca was not quite
      so much a philosopher but what he would have been well pleased to have
      found himself released, by proof of the young man's treachery, from an
      alliance below the rank to which he had all chance of early restoration,
      yet no Spaniard was ever more tenacious of plighted word than this
      inconsistent pupil of the profound Florentine. And Randal's probity being
      now clear to him, he repeated, with stately formalities, his previous
      offer of Violante's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," still falteringly sighed the provident and far-calculating Randal&mdash;"but
      your only child, your sole heiress! Oh, might not your consent to such a
      marriage (if known before your recall) jeopardize your cause? Your lands,
      your principalities, to devolve on the child of an humble Englishman! I
      dare not believe it. Ah, would Violante were not your heiress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A noble wish," said Riccabocca, smiling blandly, "and one that the Fates
      will realize. Cheer up; Violante will not be my heiress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," cried Randal, drawing a long breath&mdash;"ah, what do I hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hist! I shall soon a second time be a father. And, to judge by the
      unerring researches of writers upon that most interesting of all subjects,
      parturitive science, I shall be the father of a son. He will, of course,
      succeed to the titles of Serrano. And Violante&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will have nothing, I suppose?" exclaimed Randal, trying his best to look
      overjoyed till he had got his paws out of the trap into which he had so
      incautiously thrust them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, her portion by our laws&mdash;to say nothing of my affection&mdash;would
      far exceed the ordinary dower which the daughters of London merchants
      bring to the sons of British peers. Whoever marries Violante, provided I
      regain my estates, must submit to the cares which the poets assure us ever
      attend on wealth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" groaned Randal, as if already bowed beneath the cares, and
      sympathizing with the poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, let me present you to your betrothed." Although poor Randal had
      been remorselessly hurried along what Schiller calls the "gamut of
      feeling," during the last three minutes, down to the deep chord of despair
      at the abrupt intelligence that his betrothed was no heiress after all;
      thence ascending to vibrations of pleasant doubt as to the unborn usurper
      of her rights, according to the prophecies of parturitive science; and
      lastly, swelling into a concord of all sweet thoughts at the assurance
      that, come what might, she would be a wealthier bride than a peer's son
      could discover in the matrimonial Potosi of Lombard Street,&mdash;still
      the tormented lover was not there allowed to repose his exhausted though
      ravished soul. For, at the idea of personally confronting the destined
      bride&mdash;whose very existence had almost vanished from his mind's eye,
      amidst the golden showers that it saw falling divinely round her&mdash;Randal
      was suddenly reminded of the exceeding bluntness with which, at their last
      interview, it had been his policy to announce his suit, and of the
      necessity of an impromptu falsetto suited to the new variations that
      tossed him again to and fro on the merciless gamut. However, he could not
      recoil from her father's proposition, though, in order to prepare
      Riccabocca for Violante's representation, he confessed pathetically that
      his impatience to obtain her consent and baffle Peschiera had made him
      appear a rude and presumptuous wooer. The philosopher, who was disposed to
      believe one kind of courtship to be much the same as another, in cases
      where the result of all courtships was once predetermined, smiled
      benignly, patted Randal's thin cheek, with a "Pooh, pooh, pazzie!" and
      left the room to summon Violante.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If knowledge be power," soliloquized Randal, "ability is certainly good
      luck, as Miss Edgeworth shows in that story of Murad the Unlucky, which I
      read at Eton; very clever story it is, too. So nothing comes amiss to me.
      Violante's escape, which has cost me the count's L10,000, proves to be
      worth to me, I dare say, ten times as much. No doubt she'll have a hundred
      thousand pounds at the least. And then, if her father have no other child,
      after all, or the child he expects die in infancy, why, once reconciled to
      his Government and restored to his estates, the law must take its usual
      course, and Violante will be the greatest heiress in Europe. As to the
      young lady herself, I confess she rather awes me; I know I shall be
      henpecked. Well, all respectable husbands are. There is something scampish
      and ruffianly in not being henpecked." Here Randal's smile might have
      harmonized well with Pluto's "iron tears;" but, iron as the smile was, the
      serious young man was ashamed of it. "What am I about," said he, half
      aloud, "chuckling to myself and wasting time, when I ought to be thinking
      gravely how to explain away my former cavalier courtship? Such a
      masterpiece as I thought it then! But who could foresee the turn things
      would take? Let me think; let me think. Plague on it, here she comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Randal had not the fine ear of your more romantic lover; and, to his
      great relief, the exile entered the room unaccompanied by Violante.
      Riccabocca looked somewhat embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Leslie, you must excuse my daughter to-day; she is still
      suffering from the agitation she has gone through, and cannot see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover tried not to look too delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cruel!" said he; "yet I would not for worlds force myself on her
      presence. I hope, Duke, that she will not find it too difficult to obey
      the commands which dispose of her hand, and intrust her happiness to my
      grateful charge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be plain with you, Randal, she does at present seem to find it more
      difficult than I foresaw. She even talks of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another attachment&mdash;Oh, heavens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Attachment, pazzie! Whom has she seen? No, a convent! But leave it to me.
      In a calmer hour she will comprehend that a child must know no lot more
      enviable and holy than that of redeeming a father's honour. And now, if
      you are returning to London, may I ask you to convey to young Mr.
      Hazeldean my assurances of undying gratitude for his share in my
      daughter's delivery from that poor baffled swindler."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is noticeable that, now Peschiera was no longer an object of dread to
      the nervous father, he became but an object of pity to the philosopher,
      and of contempt to the grandee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said Randal, "you told me Frank had a share in Lord L'Estrange's
      very clever and dramatic device. My Lord must be by nature a fine actor,&mdash;comic,
      with a touch of melodrame! Poor Frank! apparently he has lost the woman he
      adored,&mdash;Beatrice di Negra. You say she has accompanied the count. Is
      the marriage that was to be between her and Frank broken off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know such a marriage was contemplated. I understood her to be
      attached to another. Not that that is any reason why she would not have
      married Mr. Hazeldean. Express to him my congratulations on his escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, he must not know that I have inadvertently betrayed his confidence;
      but you now guess, what perhaps puzzled you before,&mdash;namely, how I
      came to be so well acquainted with the count and his movements. I was so
      intimate with my relation Frank, and Frank was affianced to the marchesa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you give me that explanation; it suffices. After all, the
      marchesa is not by nature a bad woman,&mdash;that is, not worse than women
      generally are, so Harley says, and Violante forgives and excuses her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Generous Violante! But it is true. So much did the marchesa appear to me
      possessed of fine, though ill-regulated qualities, that I always
      considered her disposed to aid in frustrating her brother's criminal
      designs. So I even said, if I remember right, to Violante."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping this prudent and precautionary sentence, in order to guard
      against anything Violante might say as to that subtle mention of Beatrice
      which had predisposed her to confide in the marchesa, Randal then hurried
      on, "But you want repose. I leave you the happiest, the most grateful of
      men. I will give your courteous message to Frank."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Curious to learn what had passed between Beatrice and Frank, and deeply
      interested in all that could oust Frank out of the squire's goodwill, or
      aught that could injure his own prospects by tending to unite son and
      father, Randal was not slow in reaching his young kinsman's lodgings. It
      might be supposed that having, in all probability, just secured so great a
      fortune as would accompany Violante's hand, Randal might be indifferent to
      the success of his scheme on the Hazeldean exchequer. Such a supposition
      would grievously wrong this profound young man. For, in the first place,
      Violante was not yet won, nor her father yet restored to the estates which
      would defray her dower; and, in the next place, Randal, like Iago, loved
      villany for the genius it called forth in him. The sole luxury the
      abstemious aspirer allowed to himself was that which is found in
      intellectual restlessness. Untempted by wine, dead to love, unamused by
      pleasure, indifferent to the arts, despising literature save as means to
      some end of power, Randal Leslie was the incarnation of thought hatched
      out of the corruption of will. At twilight we see thin airy spectral
      insects, all wing and nippers, hovering, as if they could never pause,
      over some sullen mephitic pool. Just so, methinks, hover over Acheron such
      gnat-like, noiseless soarers into gloomy air out of Stygian deeps, as are
      the thoughts of spirits like Randal Leslie's. Wings have they, but only
      the better to pounce down,&mdash;draw their nutriment from unguarded
      material cuticles; and just when, maddened, you strike, and exulting
      exclaim, "Caught, by Jove!" wh-irr flies the diaphanous, ghostly larva,
      and your blow falls on your own twice-offended cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men who were acquainted with Randal said he had not a vice! The
      fact being that his whole composition was one epic vice, so elaborately
      constructed that it had not an episode which a critic could call
      irrelevant. Grand young man!
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear fellow," said Randal, as soon as he had learned from Frank
      all that had passed on board the vessel between him and Beatrice, "I
      cannot believe this. 'Never loved you'? What was her object, then, in
      deceiving not only you, but myself? I suspect her declaration was but some
      heroical refinement of generosity. After her brother's dejection and
      probable ruin, she might feel that she was no match for you. Then, too,
      the squire's displeasure! I see it all; just like her,&mdash;noble,
      unhappy woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank shook his head. "There are moments," said he, with a wisdom that
      comes out of those instincts which awake from the depths of youth's first
      great sorrow,&mdash;"moments when a woman cannot feign, and there are
      tones in the voice of a woman which men cannot misinterpret. She does not
      love me,&mdash;she never did love me; I can see that her heart has been
      elsewhere. No matter,&mdash;all is over. I don't deny that I am suffering
      an intense grief; it gnaws like a kind of sullen hunger; and I feel so
      broken, too, as if I had grown old, and there was nothing left worth
      living for. I don't deny all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor, dear friend, if you would but believe&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to believe anything, except that I have been a great fool. I
      don't think I can ever commit such follies again. But I'm a man. I shall
      get the better of this; I should despise myself if I could not. And now
      let us talk of my dear father. Has he left town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Left last night by the mail. You can write and tell him you have given up
      the marchesa, and all will be well again between you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give her up! Fie, Randal! Do you think I should tell such a lie? She gave
      me up; I can claim no merit out of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes! I can make the squire see all to your advantage. Oh, if it were
      only the marchesa! but, alas! that cursed postobit! How could Levy betray
      you? Never trust to usurers again; they cannot resist the temptation of a
      speedy profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They first buy the son, and then sell him to the father. And the squire
      has such strange notions on matters of this kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is right to have them. There, just read this letter from my mother. It
      came to me this morning. I could hang myself if I were a dog; but I'm a
      man, and so I must bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal took Mrs. Hazeldean's letter from Frank's trembling hand. The poor
      mother had learned, though but imperfectly, Frank's misdeeds from some
      hurried lines which the squire had despatched to her; and she wrote as
      good, indulgent, but sensible, right-minded mothers alone can write. More
      lenient to an imprudent love than the squire, she touched with discreet
      tenderness on Frank's rash engagements with a foreigner, but severely on
      his own open defiance of his father's wishes. Her anger was, however,
      reserved for that unholy post-obit. Here the hearty genial wife's love
      overcame the mother's affection. To count, in cold blood, on that
      husband's death, and to wound his heart so keenly, just where its jealous,
      fatherly fondness made it most susceptible!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "O Frank, Frank!" wrote Mrs. Hazeldean, "were it not for this, were
   it only for your unfortunate attachment to the Italian lady, only
   for your debts, only for the errors of hasty, extravagant youth, I
   should be with you now, my arms round your neck, kissing you,
   chiding you back to your father's heart. But&mdash;but the thought that
   between you and his heart has been the sordid calculation of his
   death,&mdash;that is a wall between us. I cannot come near you. I
   should not like to look on your face, and think how my William's
   tears fell over it, when I placed you, new born, in his arms, and
   bade him welcome his heir. What! you a mere boy still, your father
   yet in the prime of life, and the heir cannot wait till nature
   leaves him fatherless. Frank; Frank this is so unlike you. Can
   London have ruined already a disposition so honest and
   affectionate?&mdash;No; I cannot believe it. There must be some mistake.
   Clear it up, I implore you; or, though as a mother I pity you, as a
   wife I cannot forgive."
</pre>
    <p>
      Even Randal was affected by the letter; for, as we know, even Randal felt
      in his own person the strength of family ties. The poor squire's choler
      and bluffness had disguised the parental heart from an eye that, however
      acute, had not been willing to search for it; and Randal, ever affected
      through his intellect, had despised the very weakness on which he had
      preyed. But the mother's letter, so just and sensible (allowing that the
      squire's opinions had naturally influenced the wife to take what men of
      the world would call a very exaggerated view of the every-day occurrence
      of loans raised by a son, payable only at a father's death),&mdash;this
      letter, I say, if exaggerated according to fashionable notions, so
      sensible if judged by natural affections, touched the dull heart of the
      schemer, because approved by the quick tact of his intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank," said he, with a sincerity that afterwards amazed himself, "go
      down at once to Hazeldean; see your mother, and explain to her how this
      transaction really happened. The woman you loved, and wooed as wife, in
      danger of an arrest, your distraction of mind, Levy's counsels, your hope
      to pay off the debt, so incurred to the usurer, from the fortune you would
      shortly receive with the marchesa. Speak to your mother,&mdash;she is a
      woman; women have a common interest in forgiving all faults that arise
      from the source of their power over us men,&mdash;I mean love. Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I cannot go; you see she would not like to look on my face. And I
      cannot repeat what you say so glibly. Besides, somehow or other, as I am
      so dependent upon my father,&mdash;and he has said as much,&mdash;I feel
      as if it would be mean in me to make any excuses. I did the thing, and
      must suffer for it. But I'm a in&mdash;an&mdash;no&mdash;I 'm not a man
      here." Frank burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of those tears, Randal gradually recovered from his strange
      aberration into vulgar and low humanity. His habitual contempt for his
      kinsman returned; and with contempt came the natural indifference to the
      sufferings of the thing to be put to use. It is contempt for the worm that
      makes the angler fix it on the hook, and observe with complacency that the
      vivacity of its wriggles will attract the bite. If the worm could but make
      the angler respect, or even fear it, the barb would find some other bait.
      Few anglers would impale an estimable silkworm, and still fewer the
      anglers who would finger into service a formidable hornet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, my&mdash;dear Frank," said Randal; "I have given you my advice; you
      reject it. Well, what then will you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall ask for leave of absence, and run away some where," said Frank,
      drying his tears. "I can't face London; I can't mix with others. I want to
      be by myself, and wrestle with all that I feel here&mdash;in my heart.
      Then I shall write to my mother, say the plain truth, and leave her to
      judge as kindly of me as she can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right. Yes, leave town! Why not go abroad? You have never
      been abroad. New scenes will distract your mind. Run over to Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to Paris&mdash;I don't want gayeties; but I did intend to go abroad
      somewhere,&mdash;any dull dismal hole of a place. Good-by! Don't think of
      me any more for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But let me know where you go; and meanwhile I will see the squire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say as little of me as you can to him. I know you mean most kindly, but
      oh, how I wish there never had been any third person between me and my
      father! There: you may well snatch away your hand. What an ungrateful
      wretch to you I am. I do believe I am the wickedest fellow. What! you
      shake hands with me still! My dear Randal, you have the best heart&mdash;God
      bless you!" Frank turned away, and disappeared within his dressing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They must be reconciled now, sooner or later,&mdash;squire and son," said
      Randal to himself, as he left the lodgings. "I don't see how I can prevent
      that,&mdash;the marchesa being withdrawn,&mdash;unless Frank does it for
      me. But it is well he should be abroad,&mdash;something maybe made out of
      that; meanwhile I may yet do all that I could reasonably hope to do,&mdash;even
      if Frank had married Beatrice,&mdash;since he was not to be disinherited.
      Get the squire to advance the money for the Thornhill purchase, complete
      the affair; this marriage with Violante will help; Levy must know that;
      secure the borough;&mdash;well thought of. I will go to Avenel's.
      By-the-by, by-the-by, the squire might as well keep me still in the entail
      after Frank, supposing Frank die childless. This love affair may keep him
      long from marrying. His hand was very hot,&mdash;a hectic colour; those
      strong-looking fellows often go off in rapid decline, especially if
      anything preys on their minds,&mdash;their minds are so very small.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, the Hazeldean parson,&mdash;and with Avenel! That young man, too, who
      is he? I have seen him before some where.&mdash;My dear Mr. Dale, this is
      a pleasant surprise. I thought you had returned to Hazeldean with our
      friend the squire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE.&mdash;"The squire! Has he left town, and without telling me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (taking aside the parson).&mdash;"He was anxious to get back to
      Mrs. Hazeldean, who was naturally very uneasy about her son and this
      foolish marriage; but I am happy to tell you that that marriage is
      effectually and permanently broken off."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE.&mdash;"How, how? My poor friend told me he had wholly failed to
      make any impression on Frank,&mdash;forbade me to mention the subject. I
      was just going to see Frank myself. I always had some influence with him.
      But, Mr. Leslie, explain this very sudden and happy event. The marriage
      broken off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"It is a long story, and I dare not tell you my humble share
      in it. Nay, I must keep that secret. Frank might not forgive me. Suffice
      it that you have my word that the fair Italian has left England, and
      decidedly refused Frank's addresses. But stay, take my advice, don't go to
      him; you see it was not only the marriage that has offended the squire,
      but some pecuniary transactions,&mdash;an unfortunate post-obit bond on
      the Casino property. Frank ought to be left to his own repentant
      reflections. They will be most salutary; you know his temper,&mdash;he
      don't bear reproof; and yet it is better, on the other hand, not to let
      him treat too lightly what has passed. Let us leave him to himself for a
      few days He is in an excellent frame of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE (shaking Randal's hand warmly).&mdash;"You speak admirably&mdash;a
      post-obit!&mdash;so often as he has heard his father's opinion on such
      transactions. No, I will not see him; I should be too angry&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (leading the parson back, resumes, after an exchange of salutations
      with Avenel, who, meanwhile, had been conferring with his nephew).&mdash;"You
      should not be so long away from your rectory, Mr. Dale. What will your
      parish do without you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE.&mdash;"The old fable of the wheel and the fly. I am afraid the
      wheel rolls on the same. But if I am absent from my parish, I am still in
      the company of one who does me honour as an old parishioner. You remember
      Leonard Fairfield, your antagonist in the Battle of the Stocks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. AVENEL.&mdash;"My nephew, I am proud to say, sir." Randal bowed with
      marked civility, Leonard with a reserve no less marked.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. AVENEL (ascribing his nephew's reserve to shyness).&mdash;"You should
      be friends, you two youngsters. Who knows but you may run together in the
      same harness? Ah, that reminds me, Leslie, I have a word or two to say to
      you. Your servant, Mr. Dale. Shall be happy to present you to Mrs. Avenel.
      My card,&mdash;Eaton Square, Number &mdash;. You will call on me
      to-morrow, Leonard. And mind, I shall be very angry if you persist in your
      refusal. Such an opening!" Avenel took Randal's arm, while the parson and
      Leonard walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any fresh hints as to Lansmere?" asked Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I have now decided on the plan of contest. You must fight two and
      two,&mdash;you and Egerton against me and (if I can get him to stand, as I
      hope) my nephew, Leonard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said Randal, alarmed; "then, after all, I can hope for no support
      from you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't say that; but I have reason to think Lord L'Estrange will bestir
      himself actively in favour of Egerton. If so, it will be a very sharp
      contest; and I must manage the whole election on our side, and unite all
      our shaky votes, which I can best do by standing myself in the first
      instance, reserving it to after consideration whether I shall throw up at
      the last; for I don't particularly want to come in, as I did a little time
      ago, before I had found out my nephew. Wonderful young man! with such a
      head,&mdash;will do me credit in the rotten old House; and I think I had
      best leave London, go to Screwstown, and look to my business. No, if
      Leonard stand, I roust first see to get him in; and next, to keep Egerton
      out. It will probably, therefore, end in the return of one and one or
      either side, as we thought of before,&mdash;Leonard on our side; and
      Egerton sha'n't be the man on the other. You understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, my dear Avenel. Of course, as I before said, I can't dictate to
      your party whom they should prefer,&mdash;Egerton or myself. And it will
      be obvious to the public that your party would rather defeat so eminent an
      adversary as Mr. Egerton than a tyro in politics like me. Of course I
      cannot scheme for such a result; it would be misconstrued, and damage my
      character. But I rely equally on your friendly promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Promise! No, I don't promise. I must first see how the cat jumps; and I
      don't know yet how our friends may like you, nor how they can be managed.
      All I can say is, that Audley Egerton sha'n't be M.P. for Lansmere.
      Meanwhile, you will take care not to commit yourself in speaking so that
      our party can't vote for you consistently; they must count on having you&mdash;when
      you get into the House."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not a violent party-man at present," answered Randal, prudently.
      "And if public opinion prove on your side, it is the duty of a statesman
      to go with the times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very sensibly said; and I have a private bill or two, and some other
      little jobs, I want to get through the House, which we can discuss later,
      should it come to a frank understanding between us. We must arrange how to
      meet privately at Lansmere, if necessary. I'll see to that. I shall go
      down this week. I think of taking a hint from the free and glorious land
      of America, and establishing secret caucuses. Nothing like 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caucuses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Small sub-committees that spy on their men night and day, and don't
      suffer them to be intimidated to vote the other way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have an extraordinary head for public affairs, Avenel. You should
      come into parliament yourself; your nephew is so very young."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So are you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but I know the world. Does he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world knows him, though not by name, and he has been the making of
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? You surprise me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Avenel first explained about the patent which Leonard had secured to him;
      and next confided, upon honour, Leonard's identity with the anonymous
      author whom the parson had supposed to be Professor Moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie felt a jealous pang. What! then&mdash;had this village boy,
      this associate of John Burley (literary vagabond, whom he supposed had
      long since gone to the dogs, and been buried at the expense of the parish)&mdash;had
      this boy so triumphed over birth, rearing, circumstance, that, if Randal
      and Leonard had met together in any public place, and Leonard's identity
      with the rising author had been revealed, every eye would have turned from
      Randal to gaze on Leonard? The common consent of mankind would have
      acknowledged the supreme royalty of genius when it once leaves its
      solitude, and strides into the world. What! was this rude villager the
      child of Fame, who, without an effort, and unconsciously, had inspired in
      the wearied heart of Beatrice di Negra a love that Randal knew, by an
      instinct, no arts, no craft, could ever create for him in the heart of
      woman? And now, did this same youth stand on the same level in the ascent
      to power as he, the well-born Randal Leslie, the accomplished protege of
      the superb Audley Egerton? Were they to be rivals in the same arena of
      practical busy life? Randal gnawed his quivering lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the while, however, the young man whom he so envied was a prey to
      sorrows deeper far than could ever find room or footing in the narrow and
      stony heart of the unloving schemer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Leonard walked through the crowded streets with the friend and monitor
      of his childhood, confiding the simple tale of his earlier trials,&mdash;when,
      amidst the wreck of fortune and in despair of fame, the Child-angel smiled
      by his side, like Hope,&mdash;all renown seemed to him so barren, all the
      future so dark! His voice trembled, and his countenance became so sad,
      that his benignant listener, divining that around the image of Helen there
      clung some passionate grief that overshadowed all worldly success, drew
      Leonard gently and gently on, till the young man, long yearning for some
      confidant, told him all,&mdash;how, faithful through long years to one
      pure and ardent memory, Helen had been seen once more, the child ripened
      to woman, and the memory revealing itself as love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson listened with a mild and thoughtful brow, which expanded into a
      more cheerful expression as Leonard closed his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see no reason to despond," said Mr. Dale. "You fear that Miss Digby
      does not return your attachment; you dwell upon her reserve, her distant,
      though kindly manner. Cheer up! All young ladies are under the influence
      of what phrenologists call the organ of Secretiveness, when they are in
      the society of the object of their preference. Just as you describe Miss
      Digby's manner to you, was my Carry's manner to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson here indulged in a very appropriate digression upon female
      modesty, which he wound up by asserting that that estimable virtue became
      more and more influenced by the secretive organ, in proportion as the
      favoured suitor approached near and nearer to a definite proposal. It was
      the duty of a gallant and honourable lover to make that proposal in
      distinct and orthodox form, before it could be expected that a young lady
      should commit herself and the dignity of her sex by the slightest hint as
      to her own inclinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next," continued the parson, "you choose to torment yourself by
      contrasting your own origin and fortunes with the altered circumstances of
      Miss Digby,&mdash;the ward of Lord L'Estrange, the guest of Lady Lansmere.
      You say that if Lord L'Estrange could have countenanced such a union, he
      would have adopted a different tone with you,&mdash;sounded your heart,
      encouraged your hopes, and so forth. I view things differently. I have
      reason to do so; and from all you have told me of this nobleman's interest
      in your fate, I venture to make you this promise, that if Miss Digby would
      accept your hand, Lord L'Estrange shall ratify her choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Mr. Dale," cried Leonard, transported, "you make me that
      promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do,&mdash;from what you have said, and from what I myself know of Lord
      L'Estrange. Go, then, at once to Knightsbridge, see Miss Digby, show her
      your heart, explain to her, if you will, your prospects, ask her
      permission to apply to Lord L'Estrange (since he has constituted himself
      her guardian); and if Lord L'Estrange hesitate,&mdash;which, if your
      happiness be set on this union, I think he will not,&mdash;let me know,
      and leave the rest to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard yielded himself to the parson's persuasive eloquence. Indeed, when
      he recalled to mind those passages in the manuscripts of the ill-fated
      Nora, which referred to the love that Harley had once borne to her,&mdash;for
      he felt convinced that Harley and the boy suitor of Nora's narrative were
      one and the same; and when all the interest that Harley had taken in his
      own fortunes was explained by his relationship to her (even when Lord
      L'Estrange had supposed it less close than he would now discover it to
      be), the young man, reasoning by his own heart, could not but suppose that
      the noble Harley would rejoice to confer happiness upon the son of her, so
      beloved by his boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to thee, perhaps, O my mother!" thought Leonard, with swimming eyes&mdash;"to
      thee, perhaps, even in thy grave, I shall owe the partner of my life, as
      to the mystic breath of thy genius I owe the first pure aspirations of my
      soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen that Leonard had not confided to the parson his discovery
      of Nora's manuscripts, nor even his knowledge of his real birth; for the
      proud son naturally shrank from any confidence that implicated Nora's fair
      name, until at least Harley, who, it was clear from those papers, must
      have intimately known his father, should perhaps decide the question which
      the papers themselves left so terribly vague,&mdash;namely, whether he
      were the offspring of a legal marriage, or Nora had been the victim of
      some unholy fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the parson still talked, and while Leonard still mused and listened,
      their steps almost mechanically took the direction towards Knightsbridge,
      and paused at the gates of Lord Lansmere's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go in, my young friend; I will wait without to know the issue," said the
      parson, cheeringly. "Go, and with gratitude to Heaven, learn how to bear
      the most precious joy that can befall mortal man; or how to submit to
      youth's sharpest sorrow, with the humble belief that even sorrow is but
      some mercy concealed."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Leonard was shown into the drawing-room, and it so chanced that Helen was
      there alone. The girl's soft face was sadly changed, even since Leonard
      had seen it last; for the grief of natures mild and undemonstrative as
      hers, gnaws with quick ravages; but at Leonard's unexpected entrance, the
      colour rushed so vividly to the pale cheeks that its hectic might be taken
      for the lustre of bloom and health. She rose hurriedly, and in great
      confusion faltered out, "that she believed Lady Lansmere was in her room,&mdash;she
      would go for her," and moved towards the door, without seeming to notice
      the hand tremulously held forth to her; when Leonard exclaimed in
      uncontrollable emotions which pierced to her very heart, in the keen
      accent of reproach,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Digby&mdash;oh, Helen&mdash;is it thus that you greet me,&mdash;rather
      thus that you shun me? Could I have foreseen this when we two orphans
      stood by the mournful bridge,&mdash;so friendless, so desolate, and so
      clinging each to each? Happy time!" He seized her hand suddenly as he
      spoke the last words, and bowed his face over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must not hear you. Do not talk so, Leonard, you break my heart. Let me
      go, let me go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it that I am grown hateful to you; is it merely that you see my love
      and would discourage it? Helen, speak to me,&mdash;speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her with tender force towards him; and, holding her firmly by both
      hands, sought to gaze upon the face that she turned from him,&mdash;turned
      in such despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not know," she said at last, struggling for composure,&mdash;"you
      do not know the new claims on me, my altered position, how I am bound, or
      you would be the last to speak thus to me, the first to give me courage,
      and bid me&mdash;bid me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bid you what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feel nothing here but duty!" cried Helen, drawing from his clasp both her
      hands, and placing them firmly on her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Digby," said Leonard, after a short pause of bitter reflection, in
      which he wronged, while he thought to divine, her meaning, "you speak of
      new claims on you, your altered position&mdash;I comprehend. You may
      retain some tender remembrance of the past; but your duty now is to rebuke
      my presumption. It is as I thought and feared. This vain reputation which
      I have made is but a hollow sound,&mdash;it gives me no rank, assures me
      no fortune. I have no right to look for the Helen of old in the Helen of
      to-day. Be it so&mdash;forget what I have said, and forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      This reproach stung to the quick the heart to which it appealed. A flash
      brightened the meek, tearful eyes, almost like the flash of resentment;
      her lips writhed in torture, and she felt as if all other pain were light
      compared with the anguish that Leonard could impute to her motives which
      to her simple nature seemed so unworthy of her, and so galling to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word rushed as by inspiration to her lip, and that word calmed and
      soothed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother!" she said touchingly, "brother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The word had a contrary effect on Leonard. Sweet as it was, tender as the
      voice that spoke it, it imposed a boundary to affection, it came as a
      knell to hope. He recoiled, shook his head mournfully: "Too late to accept
      that tie,&mdash;too late even for friendship. Henceforth&mdash;for long
      years to come&mdash;henceforth, till this heart has ceased to beat at your
      name to thrill at your presence, we two&mdash;are strangers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strangers! Well&mdash;yes, it is right&mdash;it must be so; we must not
      meet. Oh, Leonard Fairfield, who was it that in those days that you recall
      to me, who was it that found you destitute and obscure; who, not degrading
      you by charity, placed you in your right career; opened to you, amidst the
      labyrinth in which you were well-nigh lost, the broad road to knowledge,
      independence, fame? Answer me,&mdash;answer! Was it not the same who
      reared, sheltered your sister orphan? If I could forget what I have owed
      to him, should I not remember what he has done for you? Can I hear of your
      distinction, and not remember it? Can I think how proud she may be who
      will one day lean on your arm, and bear the name you have already raised
      beyond all the titles of an hour,&mdash;can I think of this, and not
      remember our common friend, benefactor, guardian? Would you forgive me, if
      I failed to do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," faltered Leonard, fear mingling with the conjectures these words
      called forth&mdash;"but is it that Lord L'Estrange would not consent to
      our union? Or of what do you speak? You bewilder me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen felt for some moments as if it were impossible to reply; and the
      words at length were dragged forth as if from the depth of her very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came to me, our noble friend. I never dreamed of it. He did not tell
      me that he loved me. He told me that he was unhappy, alone; that in me,
      and only in me, he could find a comforter, a soother&mdash;He, he! And I
      had just arrived in England, was under his mother's roof, had not then
      once more seen you; and&mdash;and&mdash;what could I answer? Strengthen
      me, strengthen me, you whom I look up to and revere. Yes, yes, you are
      right. We must see each other no more. I am betrothed to another,&mdash;to
      him! Strengthen me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the inherent nobleness of the poet's nature rose at once at this
      appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Helen&mdash;sister&mdash;Miss Digby, forgive me. You need no strength
      from me; I borrow it from you. I comprehend you, I respect. Banish all
      thought of me. Repay our common benefactor. Be what he asks of you,&mdash;his
      comforter, his soother; be more,&mdash;his pride and his joy. Happiness
      will come to you, as it comes to those who confer happiness and forget
      self. God comfort you in the passing struggle; God bless you, in the long
      years to come. Sister, I accept the holy name now, and will claim it
      hereafter, when I too can think more of others than myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had covered her face with her hands, sobbing; but with that soft,
      womanly constraint which presses woe back into the heart. A strange sense
      of utter solitude suddenly pervaded her whole being, and by that sense of
      solitude she knew that he was gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In another room in that same house sat, solitary as Helen, a stern,
      gloomy, brooding man, in whom they who had best known him from his
      childhood could scarcely have recognized a trace of the humane, benignant,
      trustful, but wayward and varying Harley, Lord L'Estrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had read that fragment of a memoir, in which, out of all the chasms of
      his barren and melancholy past, there rose two malignant truths that
      seemed literally to glare upon him with mocking and demon eyes. The woman
      whose remembrance had darkened all the sunshine of his life had loved
      another; the friend in whom he had confided his whole affectionate loyal
      soul had been his perfidious rival. He had read from the first word to the
      last, as if under a spell that held him breathless; and when he closed the
      manuscript, it was without a groan or sigh; but over his pale lips there
      passed that withering smile, which is as sure an index of a heart
      overcharged with dire and fearful passions, as the arrowy flash of the
      lightning is of the tempests that are gathered within the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then thrust the papers into his bosom, and, keeping his hand over them,
      firmly clenched, he left the room, and walked slowly on towards his
      father's house. With every step by the way, his nature, in the war of its
      elements, seemed to change and harden into forms of granite. Love,
      humanity, trust, vanished away. Hate, revenge, misanthropy, suspicion, and
      scorn of all that could wear the eyes of affection, or speak with the
      voice of honour, came fast through the gloom of his thoughts, settling
      down in the wilderness, grim and menacing as the harpies of ancient song&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "Uncaeque manus, et pallida semper Ora."

     "Hands armed with fangs, and lips forever pale."
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus the gloomy man had crossed the threshold of his father's house, and
      silently entered the apartments still set apart for him. He had arrived
      about an hour before Leonard; and as he stood by the hearth, with his arms
      folded on his breast, and his eyes fixed lead-like on the ground, his
      mother came in to welcome and embrace him. He checked her eager inquiries
      after Violante, he recoiled from the touch of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold, madam," said he, startling her ear with the cold austerity of his
      tone. "I cannot heed your questions,&mdash;I am filled with the question I
      must put to yourself. You opposed my boyish love for Leonora Avenel. I do
      not blame you,&mdash;all mothers of equal rank would have done the same.
      Yet, had you not frustrated all frank intercourse with her, I might have
      taken refusal from her own lips,&mdash;survived that grief, and now been a
      happy man. Years since then have rolled away,&mdash;rolled over her quiet
      slumbers, and my restless waking life. All this time were you aware that
      Audley Egerton had been the lover of Leonora Avenel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley, Harley! do not speak to me in that cruel voice, do not look at me
      with those hard eyes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew it, then,&mdash;you, my mother!" continued Harley, unmoved by
      her rebuke; "and why did you never say, 'Son, you are wasting the bloom
      and uses of your life in sorrowful fidelity to a lie! You are lavishing
      trust and friendship on a perfidious hypocrite.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I speak to you thus; how could I dare to do so, seeing you
      still so cherished the memory of that unhappy girl, still believed that
      she had returned your affection? Had I said to you what I knew (but not
      till after her death), as to her relations with Audley Egerton&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well? You falter; go on; had you done so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you have felt no desire for revenge? Might there not have been
      strife between you, danger, bloodshed? Harley, Harley! Is not such silence
      pardonable in a mother? And why deprive you too of the only friend you
      seemed to prize; who alone had some influence over you; who concurred with
      me in the prayer and hope, that some day you would find a living partner
      worthy to replace this lost delusion, arouse your faculties,&mdash;be the
      ornament your youth promised to your country? For you wrong Audley,&mdash;indeed
      you do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong him! Ah, let me not do that. Proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not excuse him his rivalship, nor his first concealment of it. But
      believe me, since then, his genuine remorse, his anxious tenderness for
      your welfare, his dread of losing your friendship&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop! It was doubtless Audley Egerton who induced you yourself to conceal
      what you call his 'relations' with her whom I can now so calmly name,&mdash;Leonora
      Avenel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was so, in truth; and from motives that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough! let me hear no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will not think too sternly of what is past? You are about to form
      new ties. You cannot be wild and wicked enough to meditate what your brow
      seems to threaten. You cannot dream of revenge,&mdash;risk Audley's life
      or your own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut, tut, tut! What cause here for duels? Single combats are out of date;
      civilized men do not slay each other with sword and pistol. Tut! revenge!
      Does it look like revenge, that one object which brings me hither is to
      request my father's permission to charge myself with the care of Audley
      Egerton's election? What he values most in the world is his political
      position; and here his political existence is at stake. You know that I
      have had through life the character of a weak, easy, somewhat
      over-generous man. Such men are not revengeful. Hold! You lay your hand on
      my arm,&mdash;I know the magic of that light touch, Mother; but its power
      over me is gone. Countess of Lansmere, hear me! Ever from infancy (save in
      that frantic passion for which I now despise myself), I have obeyed you, I
      trust, as a duteous son. Now, our relative positions are somewhat altered.
      I have the right to exact&mdash;I will not say to command&mdash;the right
      which wrong and injury bestow upon all men. Madam, the injured man has
      prerogatives that rival those of kings. I now call upon you to question me
      no more; not again to breathe the name of Leonora Avenel, unless I invite
      the subject; and not to inform Audley Egerton by a hint, by a breath, that
      I have discovered&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;his 'pardonable
      deceit.' Promise me this, by your affection as mother, and on your faith
      as gentlewoman; or I declare solemnly, that never in life will you look
      upon my face again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haughty and imperious though the countess was, her spirit quailed before
      Harley's brow and voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this my son,&mdash;this my gentle Harley?" she said falteringly. "Oh,
      put your arms round my neck; let me feel that I have not lost my child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley looked softened, but he did not obey the pathetic prayer;
      nevertheless, he held out his hand, and turning away his face, said, in a
      milder voice, "Have I your promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have, you have; but on condition that there pass no words between you
      and Audley that can end but in the strife which&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strife!" interrupted Harley. "I repeat that the idea of challenge and
      duel between me and my friend from our school days, and on a quarrel that
      we could explain to no seconds, would be a burlesque upon all that is
      grave in the realities of life and feeling. I accept your promise and seal
      it thus&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his lips to his mother's forehead, and passively received her
      embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush," he said, withdrawing from her arms, "I hear my father's voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lansmere threw open the door widely, and with a certain consciousness
      that a door by which an Earl of Lansmere entered ought to be thrown open
      widely. It could not have been opened with more majesty if a huissier or
      officer of the Household had stood on either side. The countess passed by
      her lord with a light step, and escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was occupied with my architect in designs for the new infirmary, of
      which I shall make a present to our county. I have only just heard that
      you were here, Harley. What is all this about our fair Italian guest? Is
      she not coming back to us? Your mother refers me to you for explanations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have them later, my dear father; at present I can think only of
      public affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Public affairs! they are indeed alarming. I am rejoiced to hear you
      express yourself so worthily. An awful crisis, Harley! And, gracious
      Heaven! I have heard that a low man, who was born in Lansmere, but made a
      fortune in America, is about to contest the borough. They tell me he is
      one of the Avenels,&mdash;a born Blue; is it possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come here on that business. As a peer you cannot, of course,
      interfere; but I propose, with your leave, to go down myself to Lansmere,
      and undertake the superintendence of, the election. It would be better,
      perhaps, if you were not present; it would give us more liberty of
      action."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Harley, shake hands; anything you please. You know how I have
      wished to see you come forward, and take that part in life which becomes
      your birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you think I have sadly wasted my existence hitherto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be frank with you, yes, Harley," said the earl, with a pride that was
      noble in its nature, and not without dignity in its expression. "The more
      we take from our country, the more we owe to her. From the moment you came
      into the world as the inheritor of lands and honours, you were charged
      with a trust for the benefit of others, that it degrades one of our order
      of gentleman not to discharge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley listened with a sombre brow, and made no direct reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," resumed the earl, "I would rather you were about to canvass for
      yourself than for your friend Egerton. But I grant he is an example that
      it is never too late to follow. Why, who that had seen you both as youths,
      notwithstanding Audley had the advantage of being some years your senior&mdash;who
      could have thought that he was the one to become distinguished and
      eminent, and you to degenerate into the luxurious idler, averse to all
      trouble and careless of all fame? You, with such advantages, not only of
      higher fortunes, but, as every one said, of superior talents; you, who had
      then so much ambition, so keen a desire for glory, sleeping with
      Plutarch's Lives under your pillow, and only, my wild son, only too much
      energy. But you are a young man still; it is not too late to redeem the
      years you have thrown away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The years are nothing,&mdash;mere dates in an almanac; but the feelings,
      what can give me back those?&mdash;the hope, the enthusiasm, the&mdash;No
      matter! feelings do not, help men to rise in the world. Egerton's feelings
      are not too lively. What I might have been, leave it to me to remember;
      let us talk of the example you set before me,&mdash;of Audley Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must get him in," said the earl, sinking his voice into a whisper. "It
      is of more importance to him than I even thought for. But you know his
      secrets. Why did you not confide to me frankly the state of his affairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His affairs? Do you mean that they are seriously embarrassed? This
      interests me much. Pray speak; what do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has discharged the greater part of his establishment. That in itself
      is natural on quitting office; but still it set people talking; and it has
      got wind that his estates are not only mortgaged for more than they are
      worth, but that he has been living upon the discount of bills; in short,
      he has been too intimate with a man whom we all know by sight,&mdash;a man
      who drives the finest horses in London, and they tell me (but that I
      cannot believe) lives in the familiar society of the young puppies he
      snares to perdition. What's the man's name? Levy, is it not?&mdash;yes,
      Levy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen Levy with him," said Harley; and a sinister joy lighted up
      his falcon eyes. "Levy&mdash;Levy&mdash;it is well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear but the gossip of the clubs," resumed the earl; "but they do say
      that Levy makes little disguise of his power over our very distinguished
      friend, and rather parades it as a merit with our party (and, indeed, with
      all men&mdash;for Egerton has personal friends in every party) that he
      keeps sundry bills locked up in his desk until Egerton is once more safe
      in parliament. Nevertheless if, after all, our friend were to lose his
      election, and Levy were then to seize on his effects, and proclaim his
      ruin, it would seriously damage, perhaps altogether destroy, Audley's
      political career."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I conclude," said Harley. "A Charles Fox might be a gamester, and a
      William Pitt be a pauper. But Audley Egerton is not of their giant
      stature; he stands so high because he stands upon heaps of respectable
      gold. Audley Egerton, needy and impoverished, out of parliament, and, as
      the vulgar slang has it, out at elbows, skulking from duns, perhaps in the
      Bench&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; our party would never allow that; we would subscribe&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse than all, living as the pensioner of the party he aspired to lead!
      You say truly, his political prospects would be blasted. A man whose
      reputation lay in his outward respectability! Why, people would say that
      Audley Egerton has been&mdash;a solemn lie; eh, my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you talk with such coolness of your friend? You need say nothing
      to interest me in his election&mdash;if you mean that. Once in parliament,
      he must soon again be in office,&mdash;and learn to live on his salary.
      You must get him to submit to me the schedule of his liabilities. I have a
      head for business, as you know. I will arrange his affairs for him. And I
      will yet bet five to one, though I hate wagers, that he will be prime
      minister in three years. He is not brilliant, it is true; but just at this
      crisis we want a safe, moderate, judicious, conciliatory man; and Audley
      has so much tact, such experience of the House, such knowledge of the
      world, and," added the earl, emphatically summing up his eulogies, "he is
      so thorough a gentleman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thorough gentleman, as you say,&mdash;the soul of honour! But, my dear
      father, it is your hour for riding; let me not detain you. It is settled,
      then; you do not come yourself to Lansmere. You put the house at my
      disposal, and allow me to invite Egerton, of course, and what other guests
      I may please; in short, you leave all to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; and if you cannot get in your friend, who can? That borough,
      it is an awkward, ungrateful place, and has been the plague of my life. So
      much as I have spent there, too,&mdash;so much as I have done to its
      trade!" And the earl, with an indignant sigh, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley seated himself deliberately at his writing-table, leaning his face
      on his hand, and looking abstractedly into space from under knit and
      lowering brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley L'Estrange was, as we have seen, a man singularly tenacious of
      affections and impressions. He was a man, too, whose nature was eminently
      bold, loyal, and candid; even the apparent whim and levity which misled
      the world, both as to his dispositions and his powers, might be half
      ascribed to that open temper which, in its over-contempt for all that
      seemed to savour of hypocrisy, sported with forms and ceremonials, and
      extracted humour, sometimes extravagant, sometimes profound, from "the
      solemn plausibilities of the world." The shock he had now received smote
      the very foundations of his mind, and, overthrowing all the airier
      structures which fancy and wit had built upon its surface, left it clear
      as a new world for the operations of the darker and more fearful passions.
      When a man of a heart so loving and a nature so irregularly powerful as
      Harley's suddenly and abruptly discovers deceit where he had most
      confided, it is not (as with the calmer pupils of that harsh teacher,
      Experience) the mere withdrawal of esteem and affection from the one
      offender; it is, that trust in everything seems gone; it is, that the
      injured spirit looks back to the Past, and condemns all its kindlier
      virtues as follies that conduced to its own woe; and looks on to the
      Future as to a journey beset with smiling traitors, whom it must meet with
      an equal simulation, or crush with a superior force. The guilt of treason
      to men like these is incalculable,&mdash;it robs the world of all the
      benefits they would otherwise have lavished as they passed; it is
      responsible for all the ill that springs from the corruption of natures
      whose very luxuriance, when the atmosphere is once tainted, does but
      diffuse disease,&mdash;even as the malaria settles not over thin and
      barren soils, not over wastes that have been from all time desolate, but
      over the places in which southern suns had once ripened delightful
      gardens, or the sites of cities, in which the pomp of palaces has passed
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not enough that the friend of his youth, the confidant of his love,
      had betrayed his trust,&mdash;been the secret and successful rival; not
      enough that the woman his boyhood had madly idolized, and all the while he
      had sought her traces with pining, remorseful heart-believing she but
      eluded his suit from the emulation of a kindred generosity, desiring
      rather to sacrifice her own love than to cost to his the sacrifice of all
      which youth rashly scorns and the world so highly estimates,&mdash;not
      enough that all this while her refuge had been the bosom of another. This
      was not enough of injury. His whole life had been wasted on a delusion;
      his faculties and aims, the wholesome ambition of lofty minds, had been
      arrested at the very onset of fair existence; his heart corroded by a
      regret for which there was no cause; his conscience charged with the
      terror that his wild chase had urged a too tender victim to the grave,
      over which he had mourned. What years that might otherwise have been to
      himself so serene, to the world so useful, had been consumed in
      objectless, barren, melancholy dreams! And all this while to whom had his
      complaints been uttered?&mdash;to the man who knew that his remorse was an
      idle spectre and his faithful sorrow a mocking self-deceit. Every thought
      that could gall man's natural pride, every remembrance that could sting
      into revenge a heart that had loved too deeply not to be accessible to
      hate, conspired to goad those maddening Furies who come into every temple
      which is once desecrated by the presence of the evil passions. In that
      sullen silence of the soul, vengeance took the form of justice. Changed
      though his feelings towards Leonora Avenel were, the story of her grief
      and her wrongs embittered still more his wrath against his rival. The
      fragments of her memoir left naturally on Harley's mind the conviction
      that she had been the victim of an infamous fraud, the dupe of a false
      marriage. His idol had not only been stolen from the altar,&mdash;it had
      been sullied by the sacrifice; broken with remorseless hand, and thrust
      into dishonoured clay; mutilated, defamed; its very memory a thing of
      contempt to him who had ravished it from worship. The living Harley and
      the dead Nora&mdash;both called aloud to their joint despoiler, "Restore
      what thou hast taken from us, or pay the forfeit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, then, during the interview between Helen and Leonard, thus Harley
      L'Estrange sat alone! and as a rude irregular lump of steel, when wheeled
      round into rapid motion, assumes the form of the circle it describes, so
      his iron purpose, hurried on by his relentless passion, filled the space
      into which he gazed with optical delusions, scheme after scheme revolving
      and consummating the circles that clasped a foe.

    <p>
      The entrance of a servant, announcing a name which Harley, in the
      absorption of his gloomy revery, did not hear, was followed by that of a
      person on whom he lifted his eyes in the cold and haughty surprise with
      which a man much occupied greets and rebukes the intrusion of an unwelcome
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so long since your Lordship has seen me," said the visitor, with
      mild dignity, "that I cannot wonder you do not recognize my person, and
      have forgotten my name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," answered Harley, with an impatient rudeness, ill in harmony with
      the urbanity for which he was usually distinguished,&mdash;"sir, your
      person is strange to me, and your name I did not hear; but, at all events,
      I am not now at leisure to attend to you. Excuse my plainness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet pardon me if I still linger. My name is Dale. I was formerly curate
      at Lansmere; and I would speak to your Lordship in the name and the memory
      of one once dear to you,&mdash;Leonora Avenel."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (after a short pause).&mdash;"Sir, I cannot conjecture your
      business. But be seated. I remember you now, though years have altered
      both, and I have since heard much in your favour from Leonard Fairfield.
      Still let me pray, that you will be brief."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE.&mdash;"May I assume at once that you have divined the parentage
      of the young man you call Fairfield? When I listened to his grateful
      praises of your beneficence, and marked with melancholy pleasure the
      reverence in which he holds you, my heart swelled within me. I
      acknowledged the mysterious force of nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Force of nature! You talk in riddles."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE (indignantly).&mdash;"Oh, my Lord, how can you so disguise your
      better self? Surely in Leonard Fairfield you have long since recognized
      the son of Nora Avenel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley passed his hand over his face. "Ah," thought he, "she lived to bear
      a son then,&mdash;a son to Egerton! Leonard is that son. I should have
      known it by the likeness, by the fond foolish impulse that moved me to
      him. This is why he confided to me these fearful memoirs. He seeks his
      father,&mdash;he shall find him."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE (mistaking the cause of Harley's silence).&mdash;"I honour your
      compunction, my Lord. Oh, let your heart and your conscience continue to
      speak to your worldly pride."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"My compunction, heart, conscience! Mr. Dale, you insult
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE (sternly).&mdash;"Not so; I am fulfilling my mission, which bids
      me rebuke the sinner. Leonora Avenel speaks in me, and commands the guilty
      father to acknowledge the innocent child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley half rose, and his eyes literally flashed fire; but he calmed his
      anger into irony. "Ha!" said he, with a sarcastic smile, "so you suppose
      that I was the perfidious seducer of Nora Avenel,&mdash;that I am the
      callous father of the child who came into the world without a name. Very
      well, sir, taking these assumptions for granted, what is it you demand
      from me on behalf of this young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask from you his happiness," replied Mr. Dale, imploringly; and
      yielding to the compassion with which Leonard inspired him, and persuaded
      that Lord L'Estrange felt a father's love for the boy whom he had saved
      from the whirlpool of London, and guided to safety and honourable
      independence, he here, with simple eloquence, narrated all Leonard's
      feelings for Helen,&mdash;his silent fidelity to her image, though a
      child's, his love when he again beheld her as a woman, the modest fears
      which the parson himself had combated, the recommendation that Mr. Dale
      had forced upon him, to confess his affection to Helen, and plead his
      cause. "Anxious, as you may believe, for his success," continued the
      parson, "I waited without your gates till he came from Miss Digby's
      presence. And oh, my Lord, had you but seen his face!&mdash;such emotion
      and such despair! I could not learn from him what had passed. He escaped
      from me and rushed away. All that I could gather was from a few broken
      words, and from those words I formed the conjecture (it may be erroneous)
      that the obstacle to his happiness was not in Helen's heart, my Lord, but
      seemed to me as if it were in yourself. Therefore, when he had vanished
      from my sight, I took courage, and came at, once to you. If he be your
      son, and Helen Digby be your ward,&mdash;she herself an orphan, dependent
      on your bounty,&mdash;why should they be severed? Equals in years, united
      by early circumstance, congenial, it seems, in simple habits and refined
      tastes,&mdash;what should hinder their union, unless it be the want of
      fortune? And all men know your wealth, none ever questioned your
      generosity. My Lord, my Lord, your look freezes me. If I have offended, do
      not visit my offence on him,&mdash;on Leonard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so," said Harley, still controlling his rage, "so this boy&mdash;whom,
      as you say, I saved from that pitiless world which has engulfed many a
      nobler genius&mdash;so, in return for all, he has sought to rob me of the
      last affection, poor and lukewarm though it was, that remained to me in
      life? He presume to lift his eyes to my affianced bride! He! And for aught
      I know, steal from me her living heart, and leave to me her icy hand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my Lord, your affianced bride! I never dreamed of this. I implore
      your pardon. The very thought is so terrible, so unnatural! the son to woo
      the father's! Oh, what sin have I fallen into! The sin was mine,&mdash;I
      urged and persuaded him to it. He was ignorant as myself. Forgive him,
      forgive him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Dale," said Harley, rising, and extending his hand, which the poor
      parson felt himself&mdash;unworthy to take,&mdash;"Mr. Dale, you are a
      good man,&mdash;if, indeed, this universe of liars contains some man who
      does not cheat our judgment when we deem him honest. Allow me only to ask
      why you consider Leonard Fairfield to be my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was not your youthful admiration for poor Nora evident to me? Remember I
      was a frequent guest at Lansmere Park; and it was so natural that you,
      with all your brilliant gifts, should captivate her refined fancy, her
      affectionate heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Natural&mdash;you think so,&mdash;go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother, as became her, separated you. It was not unknown to me that
      you still cherished a passion which your rank forbade to be lawful. Poor
      girl! she left the roof of her protectress, Lady Jane. Nothing was known
      of her till she came to her father's house to give birth to a child, and
      die. And the same day that dawned on her corpse, you hurried from the
      place. Ah, no doubt your conscience smote you; you have never returned to
      Lansmere since."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley's breast heaved, he waved his hand; the parson resumed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom could I suspect but you? I made inquiries: they confirmed my
      suspicions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you inquired of my friend, Mr. Egerton? He was with me when&mdash;when&mdash;as
      you say, I hurried from the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, my Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Denied your guilt; but still, a man of honour so nice, of heart so
      feeling, could not feign readily. His denial did not deceive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honest man!" said Harley; and his hand griped at the breast over which
      still rustled, as if with a ghostly sigh, the records of the dead. "He
      knew she had left a son, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did, my Lord; of course, I told him that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The son whom I found starving in the streets of London! Mr. Dale, as you
      see, your words move me very much. I cannot deny that he who wronged, it
      may be with no common treachery, that young mother&mdash;for Nora Avenel
      was not one to be lightly seduced into error&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who then thought no more of the offspring of her anguish and his own
      crime&mdash;I cannot deny that that man deserves some chastisement,&mdash;should
      render some atonement. Am I not right here? Answer with the plain speech
      which becomes your sacred calling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say otherwise, my Lord," replied the parson, pitying what
      appeared to him such remorse. "But if he repent&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," interrupted Harley. "I now invite you to visit me at Lansmere;
      give me your address, and I will apprise you of the day on which I will
      request your presence. Leonard Fairfield shall find a father&mdash;I was
      about to say, worthy of himself. For the rest&mdash;stay; reseat yourself.
      For the rest"&mdash;and again the sinister smile broke from Harley's eye
      and lip&mdash;"I will not yet say whether I can, or ought to, resign to a
      younger and fairer suitor the lady who has accepted my own hand. I have no
      reason yet to believe that she prefers him. But what think you, meanwhile,
      of this proposal? Mr. Avenel wishes his nephew to contest the borough of
      Lansmere, has urged me to obtain the young man's consent. True, that he
      may thus endanger the seat of Mr. Audley Egerton. What then? Mr. Audley
      Egerton is a great man, and may find another seat; that should not stand
      in the way. Let Leonard obey his uncle. If he win the election, why, he
      'll be a more equal match, in the world's eye, for Miss Digby, that is,
      should she prefer him to myself; and if she do not, still, in public life,
      there is a cure for all private sorrow. That is a maxim of Mr. Audley
      Egerton's; and he, you know, is a man not only of the nicest honour, but
      the deepest worldly wisdom. Do you like my proposition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me most considerate, most generous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you shall take to Leonard the lines I am about to write."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   LORD L'ESTRANGE TO LEONARD FAIRFIELD.

   I have read the memoir you intrusted to me. I will follow up all
   the clews that it gives me. Meanwhile I request you to suspend all
   questions; forbear all reference to a subject which, as you may well
   conjecture, is fraught with painful recollections to myself. At
   this moment, too, I am compelled to concentre my thoughts upon
   affairs of a public nature, and yet which may sensibly affect
   yourself. There are reasons why I urge you to comply with your
   uncle's wish, and stand for the borough of Lansmere at the
   approaching election. If the exquisite gratitude of your nature so
   overrates what I may have done for you that you think you owe me
   some obligations, you will richly repay them on the day in which I
   bear you hailed as member for Lansmere. Relying on that generous
   principle of self-sacrifice, which actuates all your conduct,
   I shall count upon your surrendering your preference to private
   life, and entering the arena of that noble ambition which has
   conferred such dignity on the name of my friend Audley Egerton. He,
   it is true, will be your opponent; but he is too generous not to
   pardon my zeal for the interests of a youth whose career I am vain
   enough to think that I have aided. And as Mr. Randal Leslie stands
   in coalition with Egerton, and Mr. Avenel believes that two
   candidates of the same party cannot both succeed, the result may be
   to the satisfaction of all the feelings which I entertain for Audley
   Egerton, and for you, who, I have reason to think, will emulate his
   titles to my esteem.

   Yours,            L'ESTRANGE.
</pre>
    <p>
      "There, Mr. Dale," said Harley, sealing his letter, and giving it into the
      parson's hands,&mdash;"there, you shall deliver this note to your friend.
      But no; upon second thoughts, since he does not yet know of your visit to
      me, it is best that he should be still in ignorance of it. For should Miss
      Digby resolve to abide by her present engagements, it were surely kind to
      save Leonard the pain of learning that you had communicated to me that
      rivalry he himself had concealed. Let all that has passed between us be
      kept in strict confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will obey you, my Lord," answered the parson, meekly, startled to find
      that he who had come to arrogate authority was now submitting to commands;
      and all at fault what judgment he could venture to pass upon the man whom
      he had regarded as a criminal, who had not even denied the crime imputed
      to him, yet who now impressed the accusing priest with something of that
      respect which Mr. Dale had never before conceded but to Virtue. Could he
      have then but looked into the dark and stormy heart, which he twice
      misread!
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well,&mdash;very well," muttered Harley, when the door had closed
      upon the parson. "The viper and the viper's brood! So it was this man's
      son that I led from the dire Slough of Despond; and the son unconsciously
      imitates the father's gratitude and honour&mdash;Ha, ha!" Suddenly the
      bitter laugh was arrested; a flash of almost celestial joy darted through
      the warring elements of storm and darkness. If Helen returned Leonard's
      affection, Harley L'Estrange was free! And through that flash the face of
      Violante shone upon him as an angel's. But the heavenly light and the
      angel face vanished abruptly, swallowed up in the black abyss of the rent
      and tortured soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fool!" said the unhappy man, aloud, in his anguish&mdash;"fool! what
      then? Were I free, would it be to trust my fate again to falsehood? If, in
      all the bloom and glory of my youth, I failed to win the heart of a
      village girl; if, once more deluding myself, it is in vain that I have
      tended, reared, cherished, some germ of woman's human affection in the
      orphan I saved from penury,&mdash;how look for love in the brilliant
      princess, whom all the sleek Lotharios of our gaudy world will surround
      with their homage when once she alights on their sphere! If perfidy be my
      fate&mdash;what hell of hells, in the thought!&mdash;that a wife might lay
      her head in my bosom, and&mdash;oh, horror! horror! No! I would not accept
      her hand were it offered, nor believe in her love were it pledged to me.
      Stern soul of mine, wise at last, love never more,&mdash;never more
      believe in truth!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Harley quitted the room, Helen's pale sweet face looked forth from a
      door in the same corridor. She advanced towards him timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I speak with you?" she said, in almost inaudible accents; "I have
      been listening for your footstep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley looked at her steadfastly. Then, without a word, he followed her
      into the room she had left, and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, too," said he, "meant to seek an interview with yourself&mdash;but
      later. You would speak to me, Helen,&mdash;say on. Ah, child, what mean
      you? Why this?"&mdash;for Helen was kneeling at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me kneel," she said, resisting the hand that sought to raise her.
      "Let me kneel till I have explained all, and perhaps won your pardon. You
      said something the other evening. It has weighed on my heart and my
      conscience ever since. You said 'that I should have no secret from you;
      for that, in our relation to each other, would be deceit.' I have had a
      secret; but oh, believe me! it was long ere it was clearly visible to
      myself. You honoured me with a suit so far beyond my birth, my merits. You
      said that I might console and comfort you. At those words, what answer
      could I give,&mdash;I, who owe you so much more than a daughter's duty?
      And I thought that my affections were free,&mdash;that they would obey
      that duty. But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;" continued Helen, bowing her
      head still lowlier, and in a voice far fainter&mdash;"I deceived myself. I
      again saw him who had been all in the world to me, when the world was so
      terrible, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;I trembled. I was terrified at my
      own memories, my own thoughts. Still I struggled to banish the past,
      resolutely, firmly. Oh, you believe me, do you not? And I hoped to
      conquer. Yet ever since those words of yours, I felt that I ought to tell
      you even of the struggle. This is the first time we have met since you
      spoke them. And now&mdash;now&mdash;I have seen him again, and&mdash;and&mdash;though
      not by a word could she you had deigned to woo as your bride encourage
      hope in another; though there&mdash;there where you now stand&mdash;he
      bade me farewell, and we parted as if forever,&mdash;yet&mdash;yet O Lord
      L'Estrange! in return for your rank, wealth, your still nobler gifts of
      nature, what should I bring?&mdash;Something more than gratitude, esteem;
      reverence,&mdash;at least an undivided heart, filled with your image, and
      yours alone. And this I cannot give. Pardon me,&mdash;not for what I say
      now, but for not saying it before. Pardon me, O my benefactor, pardon me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rise, Helen," said Harley, with relaxing brow, though still unwilling to
      yield to one softer and holier emotion. "Rise!" And he lifted her up, and
      drew her towards the light. "Let me look at your face. There seems no
      guile here. These tears are surely honest. If I cannot be loved, it is my
      fate, and not your crime. Now, listen to me. If you grant me nothing else,
      will you give me the obedience which the ward owes to the guardian, the
      child to the parent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, oh, yes!" murmured Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then while I release you from all troth to me, I claim the right to
      refuse, if I so please it, my assent to the suit of&mdash;of the person
      you prefer. I acquit you of deceit, but I reserve to myself the judgment I
      shall pass on him. Until I myself sanction that suit, will you promise not
      to recall in any way the rejection which, if I understand you rightly, you
      have given to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I say to you, 'Helen, this man is not worthy of you '"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! do not say that,&mdash;I could not believe you." Harley frowned,
      but resumed calmly, "If, then, I say, 'Ask me not wherefore, but I forbid
      you to be the wife of Leonard Fairfield, I what would be your answer?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my Lord, if you can but comfort him, do with me as you will! but do
      not command me to break his heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, silly child," cried Harley, laughing scornfully, "hearts are not
      found in the race from which that man sprang. But I take your promise,
      with its credulous condition. Helen, I pity you. I have been as weak as
      you, bearded man though I be. Some day or other, you and I may live to
      laugh at the follies at which you weep now. I can give you no other
      comfort, for I know of none."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved to the door, and paused at the threshold: "I shall not see you
      again for some days, Helen. Perhaps I may request my mother to join me at
      Lansmere; if so, I shall pray you to accompany her. For the present, let
      all believe that our position is unchanged. The time will soon come when I
      may&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked up wistfully through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may release you from all duties to me," continued Harley, with grave
      and severe coldness; "or I may claim your promise in spite of the
      condition; for your lover's heart will not be broken. Adieu!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Harley entered London, he came suddenly upon Randal Leslie, who was
      hurrying from Eaton Square, having not only accompanied Mr. Avenel in his
      walk, but gone home with him, and spent half the day in that gentleman's
      society. He was now on his way to the House of Commons, at which some
      disclosure as to the day for the dissolution of parliament was expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange," said Randal, "I must stop you. I have been to Norwood,
      and seen our noble friend. He has confided to me, of course, all that
      passed. How can I express my gratitude to you! By what rare talent, with
      what signal courage, you have saved the happiness&mdash;perhaps even the
      honour&mdash;of my plighted bride!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your bride! The duke, then, still holds to the promise you were fortunate
      enough to obtain from Dr. Riccabocca?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He confirms that promise more solemnly than ever. You may well be
      surprised at his magnanimity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he is a philosopher,&mdash;nothing in him can surprise me. But he
      seemed to think, when I saw him, that there were circumstances you might
      find it hard to explain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard! Nothing so easy. Allow me to tender to you the same explanations
      which satisfied one whom philosophy itself has made as open to truth as he
      is clear-sighted to imposture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another time, Mr. Leslie. If your bride's father be satisfied, what right
      have I to doubt? By the way, you stand for Lansmere. Do me the favour to
      fix your quarters at the Park during the election. You will, of course,
      accompany Mr. Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are most kind," answered Randal, greatly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You accept? That is well. We shall then have ample opportunity for those
      explanations which you honour me by offering; and, to make your visit
      still more agreeable, I may perhaps induce our friends at Norwood to meet
      you. Good-day." Harley walked on, leaving Randal motionless in amaze, but
      tormented with suspicion. What could such courtesies in Lord L'Estrange
      portend? Surely no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am about to hold the balance of justice," said Harley to himself. "I
      will cast the light-weight of that knave into the scale. Violante never
      can be mine; but I did not save her from a Peschiera to leave her to a
      Randal Leslie. Ha, ha! Audley Egerton has some human feeling,&mdash;tenderness
      for that youth whom he has selected from the world, in which he left
      Nora's child to the jaws of Famine. Through that side I can reach at his
      heart, and prove him a fool like myself, where he esteemed and confided!
      Good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus soliloquizing, Lord L'Estrange gained the corner of Bruton Street,
      when he was again somewhat abruptly accosted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lord L'Estrange, let me shake you by the hand; for Heaven knows
      when I may see you again, and you have suffered me to assist in one good
      action."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frank Hazeldean, I am pleased indeed to meet you. Why do you indulge in
      that melancholy doubt as to the time when I may see you again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just got leave of absence. I am not well, and I am rather hipped,
      so I shall go abroad for a few weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, the sombre, brooding man felt interest and sympathy
      in the dejection that was evident in Frank's voice and countenance.
      "Another dupe to affection," thought he, as if in apology to himself,&mdash;"of
      course, a dupe; he is honest and artless&mdash;at present." He pressed
      kindly on the arm which he had involuntarily twined within his own. "I
      conceive how you now grieve, my young friend," said he; "but you will
      congratulate yourself hereafter on what this day seems to you an
      affliction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lord&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am much older than you, but not old enough for such formal ceremony.
      Pray call me L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you; and I should indeed like to speak to you as a friend. There is
      a thought on my mind which haunts me. I dare say it is foolish enough, but
      I am sure you will not laugh at me. You heard what Madame di Negra said to
      me last night. I have been trifled with and misled, but I cannot forget so
      soon how dear to me that woman was. I am not going to bore you with such
      nonsense; but from what I can understand, her brother is likely to lose
      all his fortune; and, even if not, he is a sad scoundrel. I cannot bear
      the thought that she should be so dependent on him, that she may come to
      want. After all, there must be good in her,&mdash;good in her to refuse my
      hand if she did not love me. A mercenary woman so circumstanced would not
      have done that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right. But do not torment yourself with such generous
      fears. Madame di Negra shall not come to want, shall not be dependent on
      her infamous brother. The first act of the Duke of Serrano, on regaining
      his estates, will be a suitable provision for his kinswoman. I will answer
      for this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take a load off my mind. I did mean to ask you to intercede with
      Riccabocca,&mdash;that is, the duke (it is so hard to think he can be a
      duke!)&mdash;I, alas! have nothing in my power to bestow upon Madame di
      Negra. I may, indeed, sell my commission; but then I have a debt which I
      long to pay off, and the sale of the commission would not suffice even for
      that; and perhaps my father might be still more angry if I do sell it.
      Well, good-by. I shall now go away happy,&mdash;that is, comparatively.
      One must bear things like&mdash;a man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like, however, to see you again before you go abroad. I will
      call on you. Meanwhile, can you tell me the number of one Baron Levy? He
      lives in this street, I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Levy! Oh, have no dealings with him, I advise, I entreat you! He is the
      most plausible, dangerous rascal; and, for Heaven's sake! pray be warned
      by me, and let nothing entangle you into&mdash;a POST-OBIT!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be re-assured, I am more accustomed to lend money than borrow it; and as
      to a post-obit, I have a foolish prejudice against such transactions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call it foolish, L'Estrange; I honour you for it. How I wish I had
      known you earlier&mdash;so few men of the world are like you. Even Randal
      Leslie, who is so faultless in most things, and never gets into a scrape
      himself, called my own scruples foolish. However&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay&mdash;Randal Leslie! What! He advised you to borrow on a post-obit,
      and probably shared the loan with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no; not a shilling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me all about it, Frank. Perhaps, as I see that Levy is mixed up in
      the affair, your information may be useful to myself, and put me on my
      guard in dealing with that popular gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Frank, who somehow or other felt himself quite at home with Harley, and
      who, with all his respect for Randal Leslie's talents, had a vague notion
      that Lord L'Estrange was quite as clever, and, from his years and
      experience, likely to be a safer and more judicious counsellor, was noways
      loath to impart the confidence thus pressed for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Harley of his debts, his first dealings with Levy, the unhappy
      post-obit into which he had been hurried by the distress of Madame di
      Negra; his father's anger, his mother's letter, his own feelings of
      mingled shame and pride, which made him fear that repentance would but
      seem self-interest, his desire to sell his commission, and let its sale
      redeem in part the post-obit; in short, he made what is called a clean
      breast of it. Randal Leslie was necessarily mixed up with this recital;
      and the subtle cross-questionings of Harley extracted far more as to that
      young diplomatist's agency in all these melancholy concerns than the
      ingenuous narrator himself was aware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So then," said Harley, "Mr. Leslie assured you of Madame di Negra's
      affection, when you yourself doubted of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; she took him in, even more than she did me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simple Mr. Leslie! And the same kind friend?&mdash;who is related to you,
      did you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His grandmother was a Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph. The same kind relation led you to believe that you could pay off
      this bond with the marchesa's portion, and that he could obtain the
      consent of your parents to your marriage with that lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to have known better; my father's prejudices against foreigners
      and Papists are so strong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now Mr. Leslie concurs with you, that it is best for you to go
      abroad, and trust to his intercession with your father. He has evidently,
      then, gained a great influence over Mr. Hazeldean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father naturally compares me with him,&mdash;he so clever, so
      promising, so regular in his habits, and I such a reckless scapegrace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the bulk of your father's property is unentailed; Mr. Hazeldean might
      disinherit you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I deserve it. I hope he will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no brothers nor sisters,&mdash;no relation, perhaps, after your
      parents, nearer to you than your excellent friend Mr. Randal Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that is the reason he is so kind to me, otherwise I am the last
      person to suit him. You have no idea how well-informed and clever he is,"
      added Frank, in a tone between admiration and awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Hazeldean, you will take my advice, will you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. You are too good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let all your family, Mr. Leslie included, suppose you to be gone abroad;
      but stay quietly in England, and within a day's journey of Lansmere Park.
      I am obliged to go thither for the approaching election. I may ask you to
      come over. I think I see a way to serve you; and if so, you will soon hear
      from me. Now, Baron Levy's number?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the house with the cabriolet at the door. How such a fellow can
      have such a horse!&mdash;'t is out of all keeping!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all; horses are high-spirited, generous, unsuspicious animals.
      They never know if it is a rogue who drives them. I have your promise,
      then, and you will send me your address?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will. Strange that I feel more confidence in you than I do even in
      Randal. Do take care of Levy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange and Frank here shook hands, and Frank, with an anxious
      groan, saw L'Estrange disappear within the portals of the sleek destroyer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange followed the spruce servant into Baron Levy's luxurious
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron looked greatly amazed at his unexpected visitor; but he got up,
      handed a chair to my Lord with a low bow. "This is an honour," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a charming abode here," said Lord L'Estrange, looking round.
      "Very fine bronzes,&mdash;excellent taste. Your reception-rooms above are,
      doubtless, a model to all decorators?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would your Lordship condescend to see them?" said Levy, wondering, but
      flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the greatest pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lights!" cried Levy, to the servant who answered his bell. "Lights in the
      drawing-rooms,&mdash;it is growing dark." Lord L'Estrange followed the
      usurer upstairs; admired everything,&mdash;pictures, draperies, Sevres
      china, to the very shape of the downy fauteuils, to the very pattern of
      the Tournay carpets. Reclining then on one of the voluptuous sofas, Lord
      L'Estrange said smilingly, "You are a wise man: there is no advantage in
      being rich, unless one enjoys one's riches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own maxim, Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is something, too, to have a taste for good society. Small pride
      would you have, my dear baron, in these rooms, luxurious though they are,
      if filled with guests of vulgar exterior and plebeian manners. It is only
      in the world in which we move that we find persons who harmonize, as it
      were, with the porcelain of Sevres, and these sofas that might have come
      from Versailles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I own," said Levy, "that I have what some may call a weakness in a
      parvenu like myself. I have a love for the beau monde. It is indeed a
      pleasure to me when I receive men like your Lordship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why call yourself a parvenu? Though you are contented to honour the
      name of Levy, we, in society, all know that you are the son of a
      long-descended English peer. Child of love, it is true; but the Graces
      smile on those over whose birth Venus presided. Pardon my old-fashioned
      mythological similes,&mdash;they go so well with these rooms&mdash;Louis
      Quinze."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you have touched on my birth," said Levy, his colour rather
      heightening, not with shame, but with pride, "I don't deny that it has had
      some effect on my habits and tastes in life. In fact&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact, own that you would be a miserable man, in spite of all your
      wealth, if the young dandies, who throng to your banquets, were to cut you
      dead in the streets; if, when your high-stepping horse stopped at your
      club, the porter shut the door in your face; if, when you lounged into the
      opera-pit, handsome dog that you are, each spendthrift rake in 'Fop's
      Alley,' who now waits but the scratch of your pen to endorse billets doux
      with the charm that can chain to himself for a month some nymph of the
      Ballet, spinning round in a whirlwind of tulle, would shrink from the
      touch of your condescending forefinger with more dread of its contact than
      a bailiff's tap in the thick of Pall Mall could inspire; if, reduced to
      the company of city clerks, parasite led-captains&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't go on, my dear Lord," cried Levy, laughing affectedly.
      "Impossible though the picture be, it is really appalling. Cut me off from
      May Fair and St. James's, and I should go into my strong closet and hang
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet, my dear baron, all this may happen if I have the whim just to
      try; all this will happen, unless, ere I leave your house, you concede the
      conditions I come here to impose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord!" exclaimed Levy, starting up, and pulling down his waistcoat
      with nervous passionate fingers, "if you were not under my own roof, I
      would&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truce with mock heroics. Sit down, sir, sit down. I will briefly state my
      threat, more briefly my conditions. You will be scarcely more prolix in
      your reply. Your fortune I cannot touch, your enjoyment of it I can
      destroy. Refuse my conditions, make me your enemy,&mdash;and war to the
      knife! I will interrogate all the young dupes you have ruined. I will
      learn the history of all the transactions by which you have gained the
      wealth that it pleases you to spend in courting the society and sharing
      the vices of men who&mdash;go with these rooms, Louis Quinze. Not a
      roguery of yours shall escape me, down even to your last notable
      connivance with an Italian reprobate for the criminal abduction of an
      heiress. All these particulars I will proclaim in the clubs to which you
      have gained admittance, in every club in London which you yet hope to
      creep into; all these I will impart to some such authority in the Press as
      Mr. Henry Norreys; all these I will, upon the voucher of my own name, have
      so published in some journals of repute, that you must either tacitly
      submit to the revelations that blast you, or bring before a court of law
      actions that will convert accusations into evidence. It is but by
      sufferance that you are now in society; you are excluded when one man like
      me comes forth to denounce you. You try in vain to sneer at my menace&mdash;your
      white lips show your terror. I have rarely in life drawn any advantage
      from my rank and position; but I am thankful that they give me the power
      to make my voice respected and my exposure triumphant. Now, Baron Levy,
      will you go into your strong closet and hang yourself, or will you grant
      me my very moderate conditions? You are silent. I will relieve you, and
      state those conditions. Until the general election, about to take place,
      is concluded, you will obey me to the letter in all that I enjoin,&mdash;no
      demur and no scruple. And the first proof of obedience I demand is, your
      candid disclosure of all Mr. Audley Egerton's pecuniary affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has my client, Mr. Egerton, authorized you to request of me that
      disclosure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, all that passes between us you will conceal from your
      client."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would save him from ruin? Your trusty friend, Mr. Egerton!" said the
      baron, with a livid sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong again, Baron Levy. If I would save him from ruin, you are scarcely
      the man I should ask to assist me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I guess. You have learned how he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess nothing, but obey in all things. Let us descend to your business
      room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy said not a word until he had reconducted his visitor into his den of
      destruction, all gleaming with spoliaria in rosewood. Then he said this:
      "If, Lord L'Estrange, you seek but revenge on Audley Egerton, you need not
      have uttered those threats. I too&mdash;hate the man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley looked at him wistfully, and the nobleman felt a pang that he had
      debased himself into a single feeling which the usurer could share.
      Nevertheless, the interview appeared to close with satisfactory
      arrangements, and to produce amicable understanding. For as the baron
      ceremoniously followed Lord L'Estrange through the hall, his noble visitor
      said, with marked affability,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall see you at Lansmere with Mr. Egerton, to assist in
      conducting his election. It is a sacrifice of your time worthy of your
      friendship; not a step farther, I beg. Baron, I have the honour to wish
      you good-evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the street door opened on Lord L'Estrange he again found himself face
      to face with Randal Leslie, whose hand was already lifted to the knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, Mr. Leslie!&mdash;you too a client of Baron Levy's,&mdash;a very
      useful, accommodating man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal stared and stammered. "I come in haste from the House of Commons on
      Mr. Egerton's business. Don't you hear the newspaper vendors crying out
      'Great News, Dissolution of Parliament'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are prepared. Levy himself consents to give us the aid of his talents.
      Kindly, obliging, clever person!" Randal hurried into Levy's study, to
      which the usurer had shrunk back, and was now wiping his brow with his
      scented handkerchief, looking heated and haggard, and very indifferent to
      Randal Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is this?" cried Randal. "I come to tell you first of Peschiera's
      utter failure, the ridiculous coxcomb, and I meet at your door the last
      man I thought to find there,&mdash;the man who foiled us all, Lord
      L'Estrange. What brought him to you? Ah, perhaps his interest in Egerton's
      election?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Levy, sulkily. "I know all about Peschiera. I cannot talk to
      you now; I must make arrangements for going to Lansmere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't forget my purchase from Thornhill. I shall have the money
      shortly from a surer source than Peschiera."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The squire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or a rich father-in-law."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean while, as Lord L'Estrange entered Bond Street, his ears were
      stunned by vociferous cries from the Stentors employed by "Standard,"
      "Sun," and "Globe,"
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;"Great News! Dissolution of Parliament&mdash;Great News!" The
      gas-lamps were lighted; a brown fog was gathering over the streets,
      blending itself with the falling shades of night. The forms of men loomed
      large through the mist. The lights from the shops looked red and lurid.
      Loungers usually careless as to politics were talking eagerly and
      anxiously of King, Lords, Commons, "Constitution at stake," "Triumph of
      liberal opinions,"&mdash;according to their several biases. Hearing, and
      scorning&mdash;unsocial, isolated&mdash;walked on Harley L'Estrange. With
      his direr passions had been roused up all the native powers that made them
      doubly dangerous. He became proudly conscious of his own great faculties,
      but exulted in them only so far as they could minister to the purpose
      which had invoked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have constituted myself a Fate," he said inly; "let the gods be but
      neutral, while I weave the meshes. Then, as Fate itself when it has
      fulfilled its mission, let me pass away into shadow, with the still and
      lonely stride that none may follow,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "'Oh, for a lodge in some vast wilderness.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "How weary I am of this world of men!" And again the cry "Great News&mdash;National
      Crisis&mdash;Dissolution of Parliament&mdash;Great News!" rang through the
      jostling throng. Three men, arm-in-arm, brushed by Harley, and were
      stopped at the crossing by a file of carriages. The man in the centre was
      Audley Egerton. His companions were an ex-minister like himself, and one
      of those great proprietors who are proud of being above office, and vain
      of the power to make and unmake Governments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the only man to lead us, Egerton," said this last personage. "Do
      but secure your seat, and as soon as this popular fever has passed away,
      you must be something more than the leader of Opposition,&mdash;you must
      be the first man in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a doubt of that," chimed in the fellow ex-minister, a worthy man,
      perfect red-tapist, but inaudible in the reporters' gallery. "And your
      election is quite safe, eh? All depends on that. You must not be thrown
      out at such a time, even for a month or two. I hear that you will have a
      contest&mdash;some townsmen of the borough, I think. But the Lansmere
      interest must be all-powerful; and I suppose L'Estrange will come out and
      canvass for you. You are not the man to have lukewarm friends!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be alarmed about my election. I am as sure of that as of
      L'Estrange's friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley heard, with a grim smile, and passing his hand within his vest,
      laid it upon Nora's memoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could we do in parliament without you?" said the great proprietor,
      almost piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather what could I do without parliament? Public life is the only
      existence I own. Parliament is all in all to me. But we may cross now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley's eye glittered cold as it followed the tall form of the statesman,
      towering high above all other passers-by. "Ay," he muttered, "ay, rest as
      sure of my friendship as I was of thine! And be Lansmere our field of
      Philippi! There where thy first step was made in the only life that thou
      own'st as existence, shall the ladder itself rot from under thy footing.
      There, where thy softer victim slunk to death from the deceit of thy love,
      shall deceit like thine own dig a grave for thy frigid ambition. I borrow
      thy quiver of fraud; its still arrows shall strike thee; and thou too
      shalt say, when the barb pierces home, 'This comes from the hand of a
      friend.' Ay, at Lansmere, at Lansmere, shall the end crown the whole! Go,
      and dot on the canvas the lines for a lengthened perspective, where my
      eyes note already the vanishing point of the picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then through the dull fog and under the pale gas-lights Harley L'Estrange
      pursued his noiseless way, soon distinguished no more amongst the various,
      motley, quick-succeeding groups, with their infinite sub-divisions of
      thought, care, and passion; while, loud over all their low murmurs, or
      silent hearts, were heard the tramp of horses and din of wheels, and the
      vociferous discordant cry that had ceased to attract and interest in the
      ears it vexed, "Great News, Great News&mdash;Dissolution of Parliament&mdash;Great
      News!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The scene is at Lansmere Park,&mdash;a spacious pile, commenced in the
      reign of Charles II.; enlarged and altered in the reign of Anne. Brilliant
      interval in the History of our National Manners, when even the courtier
      dreaded to be dull, and Sir Fopling raised himself on tiptoe to catch the
      ear of a wit; when the names of Devonshire and Dorset, Halifax and
      Carteret, Oxford and Bolingbroke, unite themselves, brotherlike, with
      those of Hobbes and of Dryden, of Prior and Bentley, of Arbuthnot, Gay,
      Pope, and Swift; and still, wherever we turn, to recognize some ideal of
      great Lord or fine Gentleman, the Immortals of Literature stand by his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of the rooms at Lansmere were covered with the portraits of
      those who illustrate that time which Europe calls the Age of Louis XIV. A
      L'Estrange, who had lived through the reigns of four English princes (and
      with no mean importance through all) had collected those likenesses of
      noble contemporaries. As you passed through the chambers&mdash;opening one
      on the other in that pomp of parade introduced with Charles II. from the
      palaces of France, and retaining its mode till Versailles and the Trianon
      passed, themselves, out of date&mdash;you felt you were in excellent
      company. What saloons of our day, demeaned to tailed coats and white
      waistcoats, have that charm of high breeding which speaks out from the
      canvas of Kneller and Jervis, Vivien and Rigaud? And withal,
      notwithstanding lace and brocade&mdash;the fripperies of artificial
      costume&mdash;still those who give interest or charm to that day look from
      their portraits like men,&mdash;raking or debonair, if you will, never
      mincing nor feminine. Can we say as much of the portraits of Lawrence?
      Gaze there on fair Marlborough; what delicate perfection of features, yet
      how easy in boldness, how serene in the conviction of power! So fair and
      so tranquil he might have looked through the cannon reek at Ramillies and
      Blenheim, suggesting to Addison the image of an angel of war. Ah, there,
      Sir Charles Sedley, the Lovelace of wits! Note that strong jaw and marked
      brow; do you not recognize the courtier who scorned to ask one favour of
      the king with whom he lived as an equal, and who stretched forth the right
      hand of man to hurl from a throne the king who had made his daughter&mdash;a
      countess?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [Sedley was so tenacious of his independence that when his affairs
   were most embarrassed, he refused all pecuniary aid from Charles II.
   His bitter sarcasm, in vindication of the part he took in the
   deposition of James II., who had corrupted his daughter, and made
   her Countess of Dorchester, is well known. "As the king has made my
   daughter a countess, the least I can do, in common gratitude, is to
   assist in making his Majesty's daughter&mdash;a queen!"]
</pre>
    <p>
      Perhaps, from his childhood thus surrounded by the haunting faces&mdash;that
      spoke of their age as they looked from the walls&mdash;that age and those
      portraits were not without influence on the character of Harley
      L'Estrange. The whim and the daring, the passion for letters and reverence
      for genius, the mixture of levity and strength, the polished sauntering
      indolence, or the elastic readiness of energies once called into action,&mdash;all
      might have found their prototypes in the lives which those portraits
      rekindled. The deeper sentiment, the more earnest nature, which in Harley
      L'Estrange were commingled with the attributes common to a former age,&mdash;these,
      indeed, were of his own. Our age so little comprehended, while it colours
      us from its atmosphere! so full of mysterious and profound emotions, which
      our ancestors never knew!&mdash;will those emotions be understood by our
      descendants?
    </p>
    <p>
      In this stately house were now assembled, as Harley's guests, many of the
      more important personages whom the slow length of this story has made
      familiar to the reader. The two candidates for the borough in the True
      Blue interest,&mdash;Audley Egerton and Randal Leslie; and Levy,&mdash;chief
      among the barons to whom modern society grants a seignorie of pillage,
      which, had a baron of old ever ventured to arrogate, burgess and citizen,
      socman and bocman, villein and churl, would have burned him alive in his
      castle; the Duke di Serrano, still fondly clinging to his title of Doctor
      and pet name of Riccabocca; Jemima, not yet with the airs of a duchess,
      but robed in very thick silks, as the chrysalis state of a duchess;
      Violante, too, was there, sadly against her will, and shrinking as much as
      possible into the retirement of her own chamber. The Countess of Lansmere
      had deserted her lord, in order to receive the guests of her son; my lord
      himself, ever bent on being of use in some part of his country, and
      striving hard to distract his interest from his plague of a borough, had
      gone down into Cornwall to inquire into the social condition of certain
      troglodytes who worked in some mines which the earl had lately had the
      misfortune to wring from the Court of Chancery, after a lawsuit commenced
      by his grandfather; and a Blue Book, issued in the past session by order
      of parliament, had especially quoted the troglodytes thus devolved on the
      earl as bipeds who were in considerable ignorance of the sun, and had
      never been known to wash their feet since the day when they came into the
      world,&mdash;their world underground, chipped off from the Bottomless Pit!
    </p>
    <p>
      With the countess came Helen Digby, of course; and Lady Lansmere, who had
      hitherto been so civilly cold to the wife elect of her son, had, ever
      since her interview with Harley at Knightsbridge, clung to Helen with
      almost a caressing fondness. The stern countess was tamed by fear; she
      felt that her own influence over Harley was gone; she trusted to the
      influence of Helen&mdash;in case of what?&mdash;ay, what? It was because
      the danger was not clear to her that her bold spirit trembled:
      superstitions, like suspicions, are "as bats among birds, and fly by
      twilight." Harley had ridiculed the idea of challenge and strife between
      Audley and himself; but still Lady Lansmere dreaded the fiery emotions of
      the last, and the high spirit and austere self-respect which were
      proverbial to the first. Involuntarily she strengthened her intimacy with
      Helen. In case her alarm should appear justified, what mediator could be
      so persuasive in appeasing the angrier passions, as one whom courtship and
      betrothal sanctified to the gentlest?
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at Lansmere, the countess, however, felt somewhat relieved.
      Harley had received her, if with a manner less cordial and tender than had
      hitherto distinguished it, still with easy kindness and calm
      self-possession. His bearing towards Audley Egerton still more reassured
      her: it was not marked by an exaggeration of familiarity or friendship,
      which would at once have excited her apprehensions of some sinister
      design,&mdash;nor; on the other hand, did it betray, by covert sarcasms,
      an ill-suppressed resentment. It was exactly what, under the
      circumstances, would have been natural to a man who had received an injury
      from an intimate friend, which, in generosity or discretion, he resolved
      to overlook, but which those aware of it could just perceive had cooled or
      alienated the former affection. Indefatigably occupying himself with all
      the details of the election, Harley had fair pretext for absenting himself
      from Audley, who, really looking very ill, and almost worn out, pleaded
      indisposition as an excuse for dispensing with the fatigues of a personal
      canvass, and, passing much of his time in his own apartments, left all the
      preparations for contest to his more active friends. It was not till he
      had actually arrived at Lansmere that Audley became acquainted with the
      name of his principal opponent. Richard Avenel! the brother of Nora!
      rising up from obscurity, thus to stand front to front against him in a
      contest on which all his fates were cast. Egerton quailed as before an
      appointed avenger. He would fain have retired from the field; he spoke to
      Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you support all the painful remembrances which the very name of
      my antagonist must conjure up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you not tell me," answered Harley, "to strive against such
      remembrances,&mdash;to look on them as sickly dreams? I am prepared to
      brave them. Can you be more sensitive than I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton durst not say more. He avoided all further reference to the
      subject. The strife raged around him, and he shut himself out from it,&mdash;shut
      himself up in solitude with his own heart. Strife enough there! Once, late
      at night, he stole forth and repaired to Nora's grave. He stood there,
      amidst the rank grass and under the frosty starlight, long, and in
      profound silence. His whole past life seemed to rise before him; and, when
      he regained his lonely room, and strove to survey the future, still he
      could behold only that past and that grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      In thus declining all active care for an election, to his prospects so
      important, Audley Egerton was considered to have excuse, not only in the
      state of his health, but in his sense of dignity. A statesman so eminent,
      of opinions so well known, of public services so incontestable, might well
      be spared the personal trouble that falls upon obscurer candidates. And
      besides, according to current report, and the judgment of the Blue
      Committee, the return of Mr. Egerton was secure. But though Audley himself
      was thus indulgently treated, Harley and the Blue Committee took care to
      inflict double work upon Randal. That active young spirit found ample
      materials for all its restless energies. Randal Leslie was kept on his
      legs from sunrise to starlight. There does not exist in the Three Kingdoms
      a constituency more fatiguing to a candidate than that borough of
      Lansmere. As soon as you leave the High Street, wherein, according to
      immemorial usage, the Blue canvasser is first led, in order to put him
      into spirits for the toils that await him (delectable, propitious,
      constitutional High Street, in which at least two-thirds of the electors,
      opulent tradesmen employed at the Park, always vote for "my lord's man,"
      and hospitably prepare wine and cakes in their tidy back-parlours!)&mdash;as
      soon as you quit this stronghold of the party, labyrinths of lanes and
      defiles stretch away into the farthest horizon; level ground is found
      nowhere; it is all up hill and down hill,&mdash;now rough, craggy
      pavements that blister the feet, and at the very first tread upon which
      all latent corns shook prophetically; now deep, muddy ruts, into which you
      sink ankle-deep, oozing slush creeping into the pores, and moistening the
      way for catarrh, rheum, cough, sore throat, bronchitis, and phthisis;
      black sewers and drains Acherontian, running before the thresholds, and so
      filling the homes behind with effluvia, that, while one hand clasps the
      grimy paw of the voter, the other instinctively guards from typhus and
      cholera your abhorrent nose. Not in those days had mankind ever heard of a
      sanitary reform! and, to judge of the slow progress which that reform
      seems to make, sewer and drain would have been much the same if they had.
      Scot-and-lot voters were the independent electors of Lansmere, with the
      additional franchise of Freemen. Universal suffrage could scarcely more
      efficiently swamp the franchises of men who care a straw what becomes of
      Great Britain! With all Randal Leslie's profound diplomacy, all his art in
      talking over, deceiving, and (to borrow Dick Avenel's vernacular phrase)
      "humbugging" educated men, his eloquence fell flat upon minds invulnerable
      to appeals, whether to State or to Church, to Reform or to Freedom. To
      catch a Scot-and-lot voter by such frivolous arguments&mdash;Randal Leslie
      might as well have tried to bring down a rhinoceros by a pop-gun charged
      with split peas! The young man who so firmly believed that "knowledge was
      power" was greatly disgusted. It was here the ignorance that foiled him.
      When he got hold of a man with some knowledge, Randal was pretty sure to
      trick him out of a vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Randal Leslie walked and talked on, with most creditable
      perseverance. The Blue Committee allowed that he was an excellent
      canvasser. They conceived a liking for him, mingled with pity. For, though
      sure of Egerton's return, they regarded Randal's as out of the question.
      He was merely there to keep split votes from going to the opposite side;
      to serve his patron, the ex-minister; shake the paws, and smell the smells
      which the ex-minister was too great a man to shake and to smell. But, in
      point of fact, none of that Blue Committee knew anything of the prospects
      of the election. Harley received all the reports of each canvass-day.
      Harley kept the canvass-book locked up from all eyes but his own, or it
      might be Baron Levy's, as Audley Egerton's confidential, if not strictly
      professional adviser, Baron Levy, the millionaire, had long since retired
      from all acknowledged professions. Randal, however&mdash;close, observant,
      shrewd&mdash;perceived that he himself was much stronger than the Blue
      Committee believed; and, to his infinite surprise, he owed that strength
      to Lord L'Estrange's exertions on his behalf. For though Harley, after the
      first day, on which he ostentatiously showed himself in the High Street,
      did not openly canvass with Randal, yet when the reports were brought in
      to him, and he saw the names of the voters who gave one vote to Audley,
      and withheld the other from Randal, he would say to Randal, dead beat as
      that young gentleman was, "Slip out with me, the moment dinner is over,
      and before you go the round of the public-houses; there are some voters we
      must get for you to-night." And sure enough a few kindly words from the
      popular heir of the Lansmere baronies usually gained over the electors,
      from whom, though Randal had proved that all England depended on their
      votes in his favour, Randal would never have extracted more than a "Wu'll,
      I shall waute gin the Dauy coomes!" Nor was this all that Harley did for
      the younger candidate. If it was quite clear that only one vote could be
      won for the Blues, and the other was pledged to the Yellows, Harley would
      say, "Then put it down to Mr. Leslie,"&mdash;a request the more readily
      conceded, since Audley Egerton was considered so safe by the Blues, and
      alone worth a fear by the Yellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Randal, who kept a snug little canvass-book of his own, became more
      and more convinced that he had a better chance than Egerton, even without
      the furtive aid he expected from Avenel; and he could only account for
      Harley's peculiar exertions in his favour by supposing that Harley,
      unpractised in elections, and deceived by the Blue Committee, believed
      Egerton to be perfectly safe, and sought, for the honour of the family
      interest, to secure both the seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's public cares thus deprived him of all opportunity of pressing his
      courtship on Violante; and, indeed, if ever he did find a moment in which
      he could steal to her reluctant side, Harley was sure to seize that very
      moment to send him off to canvass an hesitating freeman, or harangue in
      some public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie was too acute not to detect some motive hostile to his wooing,
      however plausibly veiled in the guise of zeal for his election, in this
      officiousness of Harley's. But Lord L'Estrange's manner to Violante was so
      little like that of a jealous lover, and he was so well aware of her
      engagement to Randal, that the latter abandoned the suspicion he had
      before conceived, that Harley was his rival. And he was soon led to
      believe that Lord L'Estrange had another, more disinterested, and less
      formidable motive for thus stinting his opportunities to woo the heiress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Leslie," said Lord L'Estrange, one day, "the duke has confided to me
      his regret at his daughter's reluctance to ratify his own promise; and
      knowing the warm interest I take in her welfare, for his sake and her own;
      believing, also, that some services to herself, as well as to the father
      she so loves, give me a certain influence over her inexperienced judgment,
      he has even requested me to speak a word to her in your behalf!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, if you would!" said Randal, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must give me the power to do so. You were obliging enough to
      volunteer to me the same explanations which you gave to the duke, his
      satisfaction with which induced him to renew or confirm the promise of his
      daughter's hand. Should those explanations content me, as they did him, I
      hold the duke bound to fulfil his engagement, and I am convinced that his
      daughter would, in that case, not be inflexible to your suit. But, till
      such explanations be given, my friendship for the father, and my interest
      in the child, do not allow me to assist a cause which, however, at present
      suffers little by delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, listen at once to those explanations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Mr. Leslie, I can now only think of the election. As soon as that is
      over, rely on it you shall have the amplest opportunity to dispel any
      doubts which your intimacy with Count di Peschiera and Madame di Negra may
      have suggested.&mdash;a propos of the election, here is a list of voters
      you must see at once in Fish Lane. Don't lose a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean while, Richard Avenel and Leonard had taken up their quarters
      in the hotel appropriated to the candidates for the Yellows; and the
      canvass on that side was prosecuted with all the vigour which might be
      expected from operations conducted by Richard Avenel, and backed by the
      popular feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rival parties met from time to time in the streets and lanes, in all
      the pomp of war,&mdash;banners streaming, fifes resounding (for bands and
      colours were essential proofs of public spirit, and indispensable items in
      a candidate's bills, in those good old days). When they thus encountered,
      very distant bows were exchanged between the respective chiefs; but
      Randal, contriving ever to pass close to Avenel, had ever the satisfaction
      of perceiving that gentleman's countenance contracted into a knowing wink,
      as much as to say, "All right, in spite of this tarnation humbug."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now that both parties were fairly in the field, to the private arts of
      canvassing were added the public arts of oratory. The candidates had to
      speak, at the close of each day's canvass, out from wooden boxes,
      suspended from the windows of their respective hotels, and which looked
      like dens for the exhibition of wild beasts. They had to speak at meetings
      of Committees, meetings of electors, go the nightly round of enthusiastic
      public-houses, and appeal to the sense of an enlightened people through
      wreaths of smoke and odours of beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alleged indisposition of Audley Egerton had spared him the excitement
      of oratory, as well as the fatigue of canvassing. The practised debater
      had limited the display of his talents to a concise, but clear and
      masterly exposition of his own views on the leading public questions of
      the day, and the state of parties, which, on the day after his arrival at
      Lansmere, was delivered at a meeting of his general Committee, in the
      great room of their hotel, and which was then printed and circulated
      amongst the voters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal, though he expressed himself with more fluency and self-possession
      than are usually found in the first attempts of a public speaker, was not
      effective in addressing an unlettered crowd; for a crowd of this kind is
      all heart&mdash;and we know that Randal Leslie's heart was as small as
      heart could be. If he attempted to speak at his own intellectual level, he
      was so subtle and refining as to be incomprehensible; if he fell into the
      fatal error&mdash;not uncommon to inexperienced orators&mdash;of trying to
      lower himself to the intellectual level of his audience, he was only
      elaborately stupid. No man can speak too well for a crowd,&mdash;as no man
      can write too well for the stage; but in neither case should he be
      rhetorical, or case in periods the dry bones of reasoning. It is to the
      emotions or to the humours that the speaker of a crowd must address
      himself; his eye must brighten with generous sentiment, or his lip must
      expand in the play of animated fancy or genial wit. Randal's voice, too,
      though pliant and persuasive in private conversation, was thin and poor
      when strained to catch the ear of a numerous assembly. The falsehood of
      his nature seemed to come out when he raised the tones which had been
      drilled into deceit. Men like Randal Leslie may become sharp debaters,
      admirable special pleaders; they can no more become orators than they can
      become poets. Educated audiences are essential to them, and the smaller
      the audience (that is, the more the brain supersedes the action of the
      heart) the better they can speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick Avenel was generally very short and very pithy in his addresses. He
      had two or three favourite topics, which always told. He was a
      fellow-townsman,&mdash;a man who had made his own way in life; he wanted
      to free his native place from aristocratic usurpation; it was the battle
      of the electors, not his private cause, etc. He said little against
      Randal,&mdash;"Pity a clever young man should pin his future to two yards
      of worn-out red tape;" "He had better lay hold of the strong rope, which
      the People, in compassion to his youth, were willing yet to throw out to
      save him from sinking," etc. But as for Audley Egerton, "the gentleman who
      would not show, who was afraid to meet the electors, who could only find
      his voice in a hole-and-corner meeting, accustomed all his venal life to
      dark and nefarious jobs"&mdash;Dick, upon that subject, delivered
      philippics truly Demosthenian. Leonard, on the contrary, never attacked
      Harley's friend, Mr. Egerton; but he was merciless against the youth who
      had filched reputation from John Burley, and whom he knew that Harley
      despised as heartily as himself. And Randal did not dare to retaliate
      (though boiling over with indignant rage), for fear of offending Leonard's
      uncle. Leonard was unquestionably the popular speaker of the three. Though
      his temperament was a writer's, not an orator's; though he abhorred what
      he considered the theatrical exhibition of self, which makes what is
      called "delivery" more effective than ideas; though he had little interest
      at any time in party politics; though at this time his heart was far away
      from the Blues and Yellows of Lansmere, sad and forlorn,&mdash;yet, forced
      into action, the eloquence that was natural to his conversation poured
      itself forth. He had warm blood in his veins; and his dislike to Randal
      gave poignancy to his wit, and barbed his arguments with impassioned
      invective. In fact, Leonard could conceive no other motive for Lord
      L'Estrange's request to take part in the election than that nobleman's
      desire to defeat the man whom they both regarded as an impostor; and this
      notion was confirmed by some inadvertent expressions which Avenel let
      fall, and which made Leonard suspect that, if he were not in the field,
      Avenel would have exerted all his interest to return Randal instead of
      Egerton. With Dick's dislike to that statesman Leonard found it impossible
      to reason; nor, on the other hand, could all Dick's scoldings or coaxings
      induce Leonard to divert his siege on Randal to an assault upon the man
      who, Harley had often said, was dear to him as a brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean while, Dick kept the canvass-book of the Yellows as closely as
      Harley kept that of the Blues; and in despite of many pouting fits and
      gusts of displeasure, took precisely the same pains for Leonard as Harley
      took for Randal. There remained, however, apparently unshaken by the
      efforts on either side, a compact body of about a Hundred and Fifty
      voters, chiefly freemen. Would they vote Yellow? Would they vote Blue? No
      one could venture to decide; but they declared that they would all vote
      the same way. Dick kept his secret "caucuses," as he called them,
      constantly nibbling at this phalanx. A hundred and fifty voters!&mdash;they
      had the election in their hands! Never were hands so cordially shaken, so
      caressingly clung to, so fondly lingered upon! But the votes still stuck
      as firm to the hands as if a part of the skin, or of the dirt,&mdash;which
      was much the same thing!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whenever Audley joined the other guests of an evening&mdash;while Harley
      was perhaps closeted with Levy and committeemen, and Randal was going the
      round of the public-houses&mdash;the one with whom he chiefly conversed
      was Violante. He had been struck at first, despite his gloom, less perhaps
      by her extraordinary beauty than by something in the expression of her
      countenance which, despite differences in feature and complexion, reminded
      him of Nora; and when, by his praises of Harley, he drew her attention,
      and won into her liking, he discovered, perhaps, that the likeness which
      had thus impressed him came from some similarities in character between
      the living and the lost one,&mdash;the same charming combination of lofty
      thought and childlike innocence, the same enthusiasm, the same rich
      exuberance of imagination and feeling. Two souls that resemble each other
      will give their likeness to the looks from which they beam. On the other
      hand, the person with whom Harley most familiarly associated, in his rare
      intervals of leisure, was Helen Digby. One day, Audley Egerton, standing
      mournfully by the window of the sitting-room appropriated to his private
      use, saw the two, whom he believed still betrothed, take their way across
      the park, side by side. "Pray Heaven, that she may atone to him for all!"
      murmured Audley. "But ah, that it had been Violante! Then I might have
      felt assured that the Future would efface the Past,&mdash;and found the
      courage to tell him all. And when last night I spoke of what Harley ought
      to be to England, how like were Violante's eyes and smile to Nora's, when
      Nora listened in delighted sympathy to the hopes of my own young
      ambition." With a sigh he turned away, and resolutely sat down to read and
      reply to the voluminous correspondence which covered the table of the busy
      public man. For Audley's return to parliament being considered by his
      political party as secure, to him were transmitted all the hopes and fears
      of the large and influential section of it whose members looked up to him
      as their future chief, and who in that general election (unprecedented for
      the number of eminent men it was fated to expel from parliament, and the
      number of new politicians it was fated to send into it) drew their only
      hopes of regaining their lost power from Audley's sanguine confidence in
      the reaction of that Public Opinion which he had hitherto so profoundly
      comprehended; and it was too clearly seen, that the seasonable adoption of
      his counsels would have saved the existence and popularity of the late
      Administration, whose most distinguished members could now scarcely show
      themselves on the hustings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Lord L'Estrange led his young companion towards a green hill in
      the centre of the park, on which stood a circular temple; that commanded a
      view of the country round for miles. They had walked in silence till they
      gained the summit of the sloped and gradual ascent; and then, as they
      stood still, side by side, Harley thus spoke,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen, you know that Leonard is in the town, though I cannot receive him
      at the Park, since he is standing in opposition to my guests, Egerton and
      Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"But that seems to me so strange. How&mdash;how could Leonard
      do anything that seems hostile to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Would his hostility to me lower him in your opinion? If he
      know that I am his rival, does not rivalry include hate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"Oh, Lord L'Estrange, how can you speak thus; how so wrong
      yourself? Hate&mdash;hate to you! and from Leonard Fairfield!"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"You evade my question. Would his hate or hostility to me
      affect your sentiments towards him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (looking down).&mdash;"I could not force myself to believe in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"Because it would be so unworthy of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Poor child! You have the delusion of your years. You deck a
      cloud in the hues of the rainbow, and will not believe that its glory is
      borrowed from the sun of your own fancy. But here, at least, you are not
      deceived. Leonard obeys but my wishes, and, I believe, against his own
      will. He has none of man's noblest attribute, Ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"No ambition!"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"It is vanity that stirs the poet to toil,&mdash;if toil the
      wayward chase of his own chimeras can be called. Ambition is a more
      masculine passion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen shook her head gently, but made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"If I utter a word that profanes one of your delusions, you
      shake your head and are incredulous. Pause: listen one moment to my
      counsels,&mdash;perhaps the last I may ever obtrude upon you. Lift your
      eyes; look around. Far as your eye can reach, nay, far beyond the line
      which the horizon forms in the landscape, stretch the lands of my
      inheritance. Yonder you see the home in which my forefathers for many
      generations lived with honour, and died lamented. All these, in the course
      of nature, might one day have been your own, had you not rejected my
      proposals. I offered you, it is true, not what is commonly called Love; I
      offered you sincere esteem, and affections the more durable for their
      calm. You have not been reared by the world in the low idolatry of rank
      and wealth; but even romance cannot despise the power of serving others,
      which rank and wealth bestow. For myself, hitherto indolence, and lately
      disdain, rob fortune of these nobler attributes. But she who will share my
      fortune may dispense it so as to atone for my sins of omission. On the
      other side, grant that there is no bar to your preference for Leonard
      Fairfield, what does your choice present to you? Those of his kindred with
      whom you will associate are unrefined and mean. His sole income is derived
      from precarious labours; the most vulgar of all anxieties&mdash;the fear
      of bread itself for the morrow&mdash;must mingle with all your romance,
      and soon steal from love all its poetry. You think his affection will
      console you for every sacrifice. Folly! the love of poets is for a mist, a
      moonbeam, a denizen of air, a phantom that they call an Ideal. They
      suppose for a moment that they have found that Ideal in Chloe or Phyllis,
      Helen or a milkmaid. Bah! the first time you come to the poet with the
      baker's bill, where flies the Ideal? I knew one more brilliant than
      Leonard, more exquisitely gifted by nature; that one was a woman; she saw
      a man hard and cold as that stone at your feet,&mdash;a false, hollow,
      sordid worldling; she made him her idol, beheld in him all that history
      would not recognize in a Caesar, that mythology would scarcely grant to an
      Apollo: to him she was the plaything of an hour; she died, and before the
      year was out he had married for money! I knew another instance,&mdash;I
      speak of myself. I loved before I was your age. Had an angel warned me
      then, I would have been incredulous as you. How that ended, no matter: but
      had it not been for that dream of maudlin delirium, I had lived and acted
      as others of my kind and my sphere,&mdash;married from reason and
      judgment, been now a useful and happy man. Pause, then. Will you still
      reject me for Leonard Fairfield? For the last time you have the option,&mdash;me
      and all the substance of waking life, Leonard Fairfield and the shadows of
      a fleeting dream. Speak! You hesitate. Nay, take time to decide."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"Ah, Lord L'Estrange, you who have felt what it is to love,
      how can you doubt my answer; how think that I could be so base, so
      ungrateful as take from yourself what you call the substance of waking
      life, while my heart was far away, faithful to what you call a dream?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"But can you not dispel the dream?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN (her whole face one flush).&mdash;"It was wrong to call it dream! It
      is the reality of life to me. All things else are as dreams."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (taking her hand and kissing it with respect).&mdash;"Helen, you
      have a noble heart, and I have tempted you in vain. I regret your choice,
      though I will no more oppose it. I regret it, though I shall never witness
      your disappointment. As the wife of that man, I shall see and know you no
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN.&mdash;"Oh, no! do not say that. Why? Wherefore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (his brows meeting).&mdash;"He is the child of fraud and of shame.
      His father is my foe, and my hate descends to the son. He, too, the son,
      filches from me&mdash;But complaints are idle. When the next few days are
      over, think of me but as one who abandons all right over your actions, and
      is a stranger to your future fate. Pooh! dry your tears: so long as you
      love Leonard or esteem me, rejoice that our paths do not cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on impatiently; but Helen, alarmed and wondering, followed
      close, took his arm timidly, and sought to soothe him. She felt that he
      wronged Leonard,&mdash;that he knew not how Leonard had yielded all hope
      when he learned to whom she was affianced. For Leonard's sake she
      conquered her bashfulness, and sought to explain. But at her first
      hesitating, faltered words, Harley, who with great effort suppressed the
      emotions which swelled within him, abruptly left her side, and plunged
      into the recesses of thick, farspreading groves, that soon wrapped him
      from her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation occurred between Lord L'Estrange and his ward, the
      soi-disant Riccabocca and Violante were walking slowly through the
      gardens. The philosopher, unchanged by his brightening prospects,&mdash;so
      far as the outer man was concerned,&mdash;still characterized by the red
      umbrella and the accustomed pipe,&mdash;took the way mechanically towards
      the sunniest quarter of the grounds, now and then glancing tenderly at
      Violante's downcast, melancholy face, but not speaking; only, at each
      glance, there came a brisker cloud from the pipe, as if obedient to a
      fuller heave of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, in a spot which lay open towards the south, and seemed to
      collect all the gentlest beams of the November sun, screened from the
      piercing east by dense evergreens, and flanked from the bleak north by
      lofty walls, Riccabocca paused and seated himself. Flowers still bloomed
      on the sward in front, over which still fluttered the wings of those later
      and more brilliant butterflies that, unseen in the genial days of our
      English summer, come with autumnal skies, and sport round the mournful
      steps of the coming winter,&mdash;types of those thoughts which visit and
      delight the contemplation of age, while the current yet glides free from
      the iron ice, and the leaves yet linger on the boughs; thoughts that
      associate the memories of the departed summer with messages from suns that
      shall succeed the winter, and expand colours the most steeped in light and
      glory, just as the skies through which they gleam are darkening, and the
      flowers on which they hover fade from the surface of the earth, dropping
      still seeds, that sink deep out of sight below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daughter," said Riccabocca, drawing Violante to his side with caressing
      arm,&mdash;"Daughter! Mark how they who turn towards the south can still
      find the sunny side of the land scape! In all the seasons of life, how
      much of chill or of warmth depends on our choice of the aspect! Sit down:
      let us reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante sat down passively, clasping her father's hand in both her own.
      Reason! harsh word to the ears of Feeling! "You shrink," resumed
      Riccabocca, "from even the courtship, even the presence of the suitor in
      whom my honour binds me to recognize your future bridegroom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante drew away her hands, and placed them before her eyes
      shudderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But" continued Riccabocca, rather peevishly, "this is not listening to
      reason. I may object to Mr. Leslie, because he has not an adequate rank or
      fortune to pretend to a daughter of my house; that would be what every one
      would allow to be reasonable in a father; except, indeed," added the poor
      sage, trying hard to be sprightly, and catching hold of a proverb to help
      him&mdash;"except, indeed, those wise enough to recollect that admonitory
      saying, 'Casa il figlio quando vuoi, e la figlia quando puoi,'&mdash;[Marry
      your son when you will, your daughter when you can]. Seriously, if I
      overlook those objections to Mr. Leslie, it is not natural for a young
      girl to enforce them. What is reason in you is quite another thing from
      reason in me. Mr. Leslie is young, not ill-looking, has the air of a
      gentleman, is passionately enamoured of you, and has proved his affection
      by risking his life against that villanous Peschiera,&mdash;that is, he
      would have risked it had Peschiera not been shipped out of the way. If,
      then, you will listen to reason, pray what can reason say against Mr.
      Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, I detest him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cospetto!" persisted Riccabocca, testily, "you have no reason to detest
      him. If you had any reason, child, I am sure that I should be the last
      person to dispute it. How can you know your own mind in such a matter? It
      is not as if you had seen anyone else you could prefer. Not another man of
      your own years do you even know,&mdash;except, indeed, Leonard Fairfield,
      whom, though I grant he is handsomer, and with more imagination and genius
      than Mr. Leslie, you still must remember as the boy who worked in my
      garden. Ah, to be sure, there is Frank Hazeldean; fine lad, but his
      affections are pre-engaged. In short," continued the sage, dogmatically,
      "there is no one else you can, by any possible caprice, prefer to Mr.
      Leslie; and for a girl who has no one else in her head to talk of
      detesting a well-looking, well-dressed, clever young man, is&mdash;a
      nonsense&mdash;'Chi lascia il poco per haver l'assai ne l'uno, ne l'altro
      avera mai'&mdash;which may be thus paraphrased,&mdash;The young lady who
      refuses a mortal in the hope of obtaining an angel, loses the one, and
      will never fall in with the other. So now, having thus shown that the
      darker side of the question is contrary to reason, let us look to the
      brighter. In the first place&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Father, Father!" cried Violante, passionately, "you to whom I once
      came for comfort in every childish sorrow do not talk to me with this
      cutting levity. See, I lay my head upon your breast, I put my arms around
      you; and now, can you reason me into misery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Child, child, do not be so wayward. Strive, at least, against a prejudice
      that you cannot defend. My Violante, my darling, this is no trifle. Here I
      must cease to be the fond, foolish father, whom you can do what you will
      with. Here I am Alphonso, Duke di Serrano; for here my honour as noble and
      my word as man are involved. I, then, but a helpless exile, no hope of
      fairer prospects before me, trembling like a coward at the wiles of my
      unscrupulous kinsman, grasping at all chances to save you from his snares,&mdash;self
      offered your hand to Randal Leslie,&mdash;offered, promised, pledged it;
      and now that my fortunes seem assured, my rank in all likelihood restored,
      my foe crushed, my fears at rest, now, does it become me to retract what I
      myself have urged? It is not the noble, it is the parvenu, who has only to
      grow rich, in order to forget those whom in poverty he hailed as his
      friends. Is it for me to make the poor excuse, never heard on the lips of
      an Italian prince, 'that I cannot command the obedience of my child;'
      subject myself to the galling answer, 'Duke of Serrano, you could once
      command that obedience, when, in exile, penury, and terror you offered me
      a bride without a dower'? Child, Violante, daughter of ancestors on whose
      honour never slander set a stain, I call on you to redeem your father's
      plighted word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, must it be so? Is not even the convent open to me? Nay, look not
      so coldly on me. If you could but read my heart! And oh! I feel so assured
      of your own repentance hereafter,&mdash;so assured that this man is not
      what you believe him. I so suspect that he has been playing throughout
      some secret and perfidious part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" interrupted Riccabocca, "Harley has perhaps infected you with that
      notion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! But is not Harley, is not Lord L'Estrange one whose opinion you
      have cause to esteem? And if he distrusts Mr. Leslie&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him make good his distrust by such proof as will absolve my word, and
      I shall share your own joy. I have told him this. I have invited him to
      make good his suspicions, he puts me off. He cannot do so," added
      Riccabocca, in a dejected tone; "Randal has already so well explained all
      that Harley deemed equivocal. Violante, my name and my honour rest in your
      hands. Cast them away if you will; I cannot constrain you, and I cannot
      stoop to implore. Noblesse oblige! With your birth you took its duties.
      Let them decide between your vain caprice and your father's solemn
      remonstrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming a sternness that he was far from feeling, and putting aside his
      daughter's arms, the exile walked away. Violante paused a moment,
      shivered, looked round as if taking a last farewell of joy and peace and
      hope on earth, and then approaching her father with a firm step, she said,
      "I never rebelled, Father; I did but entreat. What you say is my law now,
      as it has ever been; and come what may, never shall you hear complaint or
      murmur from me. Poor Father, you will suffer more than I shall. Kiss me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      About an hour afterwards, as the short day closed in, Harley, returning
      from his solitary wanderings, after he had parted from Helen, encountered
      on the terrace, before the house, Lady Lansmere and Audley Egerton arm in
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley had drawn his hat over his brows, and his eyes were fixed on the
      ground, so that he did not see the group upon which he came unawares,
      until Audley's voice startled him from his revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Harley," said the ex-minister, with a faint smile, "you must not
      pass us by, now that you have a moment of leisure from the cares of the
      election. And, Harley, though we are under the same roof, I see you so
      little." Lord L'Estrange darted a quick glance towards his mother,&mdash;a
      glance that seemed to say, "You leaning on Audley's arm! Have you kept
      your promise?" And the eye that met his own reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said Harley; "but you, who know that, once engaged in public
      affairs, one has no heart left for the ties of private life, will excuse
      me. And this election is so important!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, Mr. Egerton," said Lady Lansmere, "whom the election most
      concerns, seem privileged to be the only one who appears indifferent to
      success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay; but you are not indifferent?" said Lord L'Estrange, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. How can I be so, when my whole future career may depend on it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley drew Egerton aside. "There is one voter you ought at least to call
      upon and thank. He cannot be made to comprehend that, for the sake of any
      relation, even for the sake of his own son, he is to vote against the
      Blues,&mdash;against you; I mean, of course, Nora's father, John Avenel.
      His vote and his son-in-law's gained your majority at your first
      election."
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Call on John Avenel! Have you called?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (calmly).&mdash;"Yes. Poor old man, his mind has been affected ever
      since Nora's death. But your name as the candidate for the borough at that
      time,&mdash;the successful candidate for whose triumph the joy-bells
      chimed with her funeral knell,&mdash;your name brings up her memory; and
      he talks in a breath of her and of you. Come, let us walk together to his
      house; it is close by the Park Lodge."
    </p>
    <p>
      The drops stood on Audley's brow! He fixed his dark handsome eyes, in
      mournful amaze, upon Harley's tranquil face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley, at last, then, you have forgotten the Past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but the Present is more imperious. All my efforts are needed to
      requite your friendship. You stand against her brother,&mdash;yet her
      father votes for you. And her mother says to her son, 'Let the old man
      alone. Conscience is all that is well alive in him; and he thinks if he
      were to vote against the Blues, he would sin against honour.' 'An
      electioneering prejudice,' some sceptics would say. But you must be
      touched by this trait of human nature,&mdash;in her father, too,&mdash;you,
      Audley Egerton, who are the soul of honour. What ails you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Nothing; a spasm at the heart; my old complaint. Well, I
      will call on the poor man later, but not now,&mdash;not with you. Nay,
      nay, I will not,&mdash;I cannot. Harley, just as you joined us, I was
      talking to your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Ay, and what of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Yourself. I saw you from my windows walking with your
      betrothed. Afterwards I observed her coming home alone; and by the glimpse
      I caught of her gentle countenance, it seemed sad. Harley, do you deceive
      us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Deceive! I! How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"DO you really feel that your intended marriage will bestow
      on you the happiness, which is my prayer, as it must be your mother's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Happiness, I hoped so. But perhaps&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"Perhaps what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Perhaps the marriage may not take place. Perhaps I have a
      rival; not an open one,&mdash;a secret, stealthy wooer, in one, too, whom
      I have loved, served, trusted. Question me not now. Such instances of
      treachery make one learn more how to prize a friendship honest, devoted,
      faithful as your own, Audley Egerton. But here comes your protege,
      released awhile from his canvass, and your confidential adviser, Baron
      Levy. He accompanied Randal through the town to-day. So anxious is he to
      see that that young man does not play false, and regard his own interest
      before yours! Would that surprise you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON.&mdash;"You are too severe upon Randal Leslie. He is ambitious,
      worldly, has no surplus of affection at the command of his heart&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Is it Randal Leslie you describe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      EGERTON (with a languid smile).&mdash;"Yes, you see I do not flatter. But
      he is born and reared a gentleman; as such he would scarcely do anything
      mean. And, after all, it is with me that he must rise or fall. His very
      intellect must tell him that. But again I ask, do not strive to prepossess
      me against him. I am a man who could have loved a son. I have none.
      Randal, such as he is, is a sort of son. He carries on my projects and my
      interest in the world of men beyond the goal of the tomb."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley turned kindly to Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Leslie, what report of the canvass?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Levy has the book, sir. I think we have gained ten fresh votes for you,
      and perhaps seven for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me rid you of your book, Baron Levy," said Harley. Just at this time
      Riccabocca and Violante approached the house, both silent. The Italian
      caught sight of Randal, and made him a sign to join them. The young lover
      glanced fearfully towards Harley, and then with alacrity bounded forward,
      and was soon at Violante's side. But scarce had Harley, surprised by
      Leslie's sudden disappearance, remarked the cause, than with equal
      abruptness he abandoned the whispered conference he had commenced with
      Levy, and hastening to Randal, laid hand on the young man's shoulder,
      exclaiming, "Ten thousand pardons to all three! But I cannot allow this
      waste of time, Mr. Leslie. You have yet an hour before it grows dark.
      There are three out-voters six miles off, influential farmers, whom you
      must canvass in person with my father's steward. Hasten to the stables;
      choose your own horse. To saddle, to saddle! Baron Levy, go and order my
      Lord's steward, Mr. Smart, to join Mr. Leslie at the stables; then come
      back to me,&mdash;quick. What! loitering still, Mr. Leslie! You will make
      me throw up your whole cause in disgust at your indolence and apathy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed at this threat, Randal lifted his accusing eyes to heaven and
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Audley had drawn close to Lady Lansmere, who was leaning, in
      thought, over the balustrade of the terrace. "Do you note," said Audley,
      whispering, "how Harley sprang forward when the fair Italian came in
      sight? Trust me, I was right. I know little of the young lady, but I have
      conversed with her. I have gazed on the changes in her face. If Harley
      ever love again, and if ever love influence and exalt his mind, wish with
      me that his choice may yet fall where I believe that his heart inclines
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY LANSMERE.&mdash;"Ah, that it were so! Helen, I own, is charming; but&mdash;but&mdash;Violante
      is equal in birth! Are you not aware that she is engaged to your young
      friend Mr. Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      AUDLEY.&mdash;"Randal told me so; but I cannot believe it. In fact, I have
      taken occasion to sound that fair creature's inclinations, and if I know
      aught of women, her heart is not with Randal. I cannot believe her to be
      one whose affections are so weak as to be easily constrained; nor can I
      suppose that her father could desire to enforce a marriage that is almost
      a misalliance. Randal must deceive himself; and from something Harley just
      let fall, in our painful but brief conversation, I suspect that his
      engagement with Miss Digby is broken off. He promises to tell me more
      later. Yes," continued Audley, mournfully, "observe Violante's
      countenance, with its ever-varying play; listen to her voice, to which
      feeling seems to give the expressive music, and tell me whether you are
      not sometimes reminded of&mdash;of&mdash;In one word, there is one who,
      even without rank or fortune, would be worthy to replace the image of
      Leonora, and be to Harley&mdash;what Leonora could not; for sure I am that
      Violante loves him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley, meanwhile, had lingered with Riccabocca and Violante, speaking but
      on indifferent subjects, obtaining short answers from the first, and none
      from the last, when the sage drew him a little aside, and whispered, "She
      has consented to sacrifice herself to my sense of honour. But, O Harley!
      if she be unhappy, it will break my heart. Either you must give me
      sufficient proof of Randal's unworthiness, to absolve me from my promise,
      or I must again entreat, you to try and conciliate the poor child in his
      favour. All you say has weight with her; she respects you as&mdash;a
      second father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley did not seem peculiarly flattered by that last assurance; but he
      was relieved from an immediate answer by the appearance of a man who came
      from the direction of the stables, and whose dress, covered with dust, and
      travel-stained, seemed like that of a foreign courier. No sooner did
      Harley catch sight of this person, than he sprang forward, and accosted
      him briefly and rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been quick; I did not expect you so soon. You discovered the
      trace? You gave my letter&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have brought back the answer, my Lord," replied the man, taking the
      letter from a leathern pouch at his side. Harley hastily broke open the
      seal, and glanced over the contents, which were comprised in a few lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Say not whence you came. Do not wait here; return at once to
      London."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley's face seemed so unusually cheerful as he rejoined the Italians,
      that the duke exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "A despatch from Vienna? My recall!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Vienna, my dear friend! Not possible yet. I cannot calculate on
      hearing from the prince till a day or two before the close of this
      election. But you wish me to speak to Violante. Join my mother yonder.
      What can she be saying to Mr. Egerton? I will address a few words apart to
      your fair daughter, that may at least prove the interest in her fate taken
      by&mdash;her second father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kindest of friends!" said the unsuspecting pupil of Machiavelli, and he
      walked towards the terrace. Violante was about to follow. Harley detained
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not go till you have thanked me; for you are not the noble Violante
      for whom I take you, unless you acknowledge gratitude to any one who
      delivers you from the presence of an admirer in Mr. Randal Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      VIOLANTE.&mdash;"Ought I to hear this of one whom&mdash;whom&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"One whom your father obstinately persists in obtruding on
      your repugnance? Yet, O dear child, you who, when almost an infant, ere
      yet you knew what snares and pitfalls, for all who trust to another, lie
      under the sward at our feet, even when decked the fairest with the flowers
      of spring; you who put your small hands around my neck, and murmured in
      your musical voice, 'Save us,&mdash;save my father,'&mdash;you at least I
      will not forsake, in a peril worse than that which menaced you then,&mdash;a
      peril which affrights you more than that which threatened you in the
      snares of Peschiera. Randal Leslie may thrive in his meaner objects of
      ambition; those I fling to him in scorn: but you! the presuming varlet!"
      Harley paused a moment, half stifled with indignation. He then resumed,
      calmly, "Trust to me, and fear not. I will rescue this hand from the
      profanation of Randal Leslie's touch; and then farewell, for life, to
      every soft emotion. Before me expands the welcome solitude. The innocent
      saved, the honest righted, the perfidious stricken by a just retribution,&mdash;and
      then&mdash;what then? Why, at least I shall have studied Machiavelli with
      more effect than your wise father; and I shall lay him aside, needing no
      philosophy to teach me never again to be deceived." His brow darkened; he
      turned abruptly away, leaving Violante lost in amaze, fear, and a delight,
      vague, yet more vividly felt than all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night, after the labours of the day, Randal had gained the sanctuary
      of his own room, and seated himself at his table, to prepare the heads of
      the critical speech he would have now very soon to deliver on the day of
      nomination,&mdash;critical speech when, in the presence of foes and
      friends, reporters from London, and amidst all the jarring interests that
      he sought to weave into the sole self-interest of Randal Leslie, he would
      be called upon to make the formal exposition of his political opinions.
      Randal Leslie, indeed, was not one of those speakers whom either modesty,
      fastidiousness, or conscientious desire of truth predisposes towards the
      labour of written composition. He had too much cleverness to be in want of
      fluent period or ready commonplace,&mdash;the ordinary materials of
      oratorical impromptu; too little taste for the Beautiful to study what
      graces of diction will best adorn a noble sentiment; too obtuse a
      conscience to care if the popular argument were purified from the dross
      which the careless flow of a speech wholly extemporaneous rarely fails to
      leave around it. But this was no ordinary occasion. Elaborate study here
      was requisite, not for the orator, but the hypocrite. Hard task, to please
      the Blues, and not offend the Yellows; appear to side with Audley Egerton,
      yet insinuate sympathy with Dick Avenel; confront, with polite smile, the
      younger opponent whose words had lodged arrows in his vanity, which
      rankled the more gallingly because they had raised the skin of his
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had dipped his pen into the ink and smoothed the paper before him, when
      a knock was heard at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in," said he, impatiently. Levy entered saunteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am come to talk over matters with you, mon cher," said the baron,
      throwing himself on the sofa. "And, first, I wish you joy of your
      prospects of success."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal postponed his meditated composition with a quick sigh, drew his
      chair towards the sofa, and lowered his voice into a whisper. "You think
      with me, that the chance of my success&mdash;is good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chance! Why, it is a rubber of whist, in which your partner gives you all
      the winnings, and in which the adversary is almost sure to revoke. Either
      Avenel or his nephew, it is true, must come in; but not both. Two parvenus
      aspiring to make a family seat of an earl's borough! Bah! too absurd!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear from Riccabocca (or rather the Duke di Serrano) that this same
      young Fairfield is greatly indebted to the kindness of Lord L'Estrange.
      Very odd that he should stand against the Lansmere interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ambition, mon cher. You yourself are under some obligations to Mr.
      Egerton. Yet, in reality, he has more to apprehend from you than from Mr.
      Fairfield."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I disown obligations to Mr. Egerton. And if the electors prefer me to him
      (whom, by-the-by, they once burned in effigy), it is no fault of mine: the
      fault, if any, will rest with his own dearest friend, L'Estrange. I do not
      understand how a man of such clear sense as L'Estrange undoubtedly
      possesses, should be risking Egerton's election in his zeal for mine. Nor
      do his formal courtesies to myself deceive me. He has even implied that he
      suspects me of connivance with Peschiera's schemes on Violante. But those
      suspicions he cannot support. For of course, Levy, you would not betray me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! What possible interest could I serve in that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None that I can discover, certainly," said Randal, relaxing into a smile.
      "And when I get into parliament, aided by the social position which my
      marriage will give me, I shall have so many ways to serve you. No, it is
      certainly your interest not to betray me; and I shall count on you as a
      witness, if a witness can be required."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count on me, certainly, my dear fellow," said the baron. "And I suppose
      there will be no witness the other way. Done for eternally is my poor dear
      friend Peschiera, whose cigars, by-the-by, were matchless;&mdash;I wonder
      if there will be any for sale. And if he were not so done for, it is not
      you, it is L'Estrange, that he would be tempted to do for!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may blot Peschiera out of the map of the future," rejoined Randal.
      "Men from whom henceforth we have nothing to hope or to fear are to us as
      the races before the deluge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine remark," quoth the baron, admiringly. "Peschiera, though not without
      brains, was a complete failure. And when the failure of one I have tried
      to serve is complete, the rule I have adopted through life is to give him
      up altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," echoed the baron. "On the other hand, you know that I like
      pushing forward young men of mark and promise. You really are amazingly
      clever; but how comes it you don't speak better? Do you know, I doubt
      whether you will do in the House of Commons all that I expected from your
      address and readiness in private life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I cannot talk trash vulgar enough for a mob? Pooh! I shall
      succeed wherever knowledge is really power. Besides, you must allow for my
      infernal position. You know, after all, that Avenel, if he can only return
      himself or his nephew, still holds in his hands the choice of the
      candidate upon our side. I cannot attack him; I cannot attack his insolent
      nephew&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insolent!&mdash;not that, but bitterly eloquent. He hits you hard. You
      are no match for him, Randal, before a popular audience; though, en petit
      comite, the devil himself were hardly a match for you. But now to a
      somewhat more serious point. Your election you will win, your bride is
      promised to you; but the old Leslie lands, in the present possession of
      Squire Thornhill, you have not gained,&mdash;and your chance of gaining
      them is in great jeopardy. I did not like to tell you this morning,&mdash;it
      would have spoiled your temper for canvassing; but I have received a
      letter from Thornhill himself. He has had an offer for the property, which
      is only L1000 short of what he asks. A city alderman, called Jobson, is
      the bidder; a man, it seems, of large means and few words. The alderman
      has fixed the date on which he must have a definite answer; and that date
      falls on the &mdash;th, two days after that fixed for the poll at
      Lansmere. The brute declares he will close with another investment, if
      Thornhill does not then come in to his terms. Now, as Thornhill will
      accept these terms unless I can positively promise him better, and as
      those funds on which you calculated (had the marriage of Peschiera with
      Violante, and Frank Hazeldean with Madame di Negra, taken place) fail you,
      I see no hope for your being in time with the money,&mdash;and the old
      lands of the Leslies must yield their rents to a Jobson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care for nothing on earth like those old lands of my forefathers," said
      Randal, with unusual vehemence; "I reverence so little amongst the living,
      and I do reverence the dead. And my marriage will take place so soon; and
      the dower would so amply cover the paltry advance required."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but the mere prospect of a marriage to the daughter of a man whose
      lands are still sequestered would be no security to a money-lender."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," said Randal, "you, who once offered to assist me when my
      fortunes were more precarious, might now accommodate me with this loan, as
      a friend, and keep the title-deeds of the estate as&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a money-lender," added the baron, laughing pleasantly. "No, mon cher,
      I will still lend you half the sum required in advance, but the other half
      is more than I can afford as friend, or hazard as money-lender; and it
      would damage my character,&mdash;be out of all rule,&mdash;if, the estates
      falling by your default of payment into my own hands, I should appear to
      be the real purchaser of the property of my own distressed client. But,
      now I think of it, did not Squire Hazeldean promise you his assistance in
      this matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did so," answered Randal, "as soon as the marriage between Frank and
      Madame di Negra was off his mind. I meant to cross over to Hazeldean
      immediately after the election. How can I leave the place till then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do, your election is lost. But why not write to the squire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is against my maxim to write where I can speak. However, there is no
      option; I will write at once. Meanwhile, communicate with Thornhill; keep
      up his hopes; and be sure, at least, that he does not close with this
      greedy alderman before the day fixed for decision."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done all that already, and my letter is gone. Now, do your part:
      and if you write as cleverly as you talk, you would coax the money out
      from a stonier heart than poor Mr. Hazeldean's. I leave you now;
      good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy took up his candlestick, nodded, yawned, and went. Randal still
      suspended the completion of his speech, and indited the following epistle:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   MY DEAR MR. HAZELDEAN,&mdash;I wrote to you a few hasty lines on leaving
   town, to inform you that the match you so dreaded was broken off,
   and proposing to defer particulars till I could visit your kind and
   hospitable roof, which I trusted to do for a few hours during my
   stay at Lansmere, since it is not a day's journey hence to
   Hazeldean. But I did not calculate on finding so sharp a contest.
   In no election throughout the kingdom do I believe that a more
   notable triumph, or a more stunning defeat, for the great landed
   interest can occur. For in this town&mdash;so dependent on agriculture&mdash;
   we are opposed by a low and sordid manufacturer, of the most
   revolutionary notions, who has, moreover, the audacity to force his
   own nephew&mdash;that very boy whom I chastised for impertinence on your
   village green, son of a common carpenter&mdash;actually the audacity, I
   say, to attempt to force this peasant of a nephew, as well as
   himself, into the representation of Lansmere, against the earl's
   interest, against your distinguished brother,&mdash;of myself I say
   nothing. You should hear the language in which these two men
   indulge against all your family! If we are beaten by such persons
   in a borough supposed to be so loyal as Lansmere, every one with a
   stake in the country may tremble at such a prognostic of the ruin
   that must await not only our old English Constitution, but the
   existence of property itself. I need not say that on such an
   occasion I cannot spare myself. Mr. Egerton is ill too. All the
   fatigue of the canvass devolves on me. I feel, my dear and revered
   friend, that I am a genuine Hazeldean, fighting your battle; and
   that thought carries me through all. I cannot, therefore, come to
   you till the election is over; and meanwhile you, and my dear Mrs.
   Hazeldean, must be anxious to know more about the affair that so
   preyed on both your hearts than I have yet informed you, or can well
   trust to a letter. Be assured, however, that the worst is over; the
   lady has gone abroad. I earnestly entreated Frank (who showed me
   Mrs. Hazeldean's most pathetic letter to him) to hasten at once to
   the Hall and relieve your minds. Unfortunately he would not be
   ruled by me, but talked of going abroad too&mdash;not, I trust (nay, I
   feel assured), in pursuit of Madame di Negra; but still&mdash;In short, I
   should be so glad to see you, and talk over the whole. Could you
   not come hither&mdash;I pray do. And now, at the risk of your thinking
   that in this I am only consulting my own interest (but no&mdash;your
   noble English heart will never so misiudge me!), I will add with
   homely frankness, that if you could accommodate me immediately with
   the loan you not long since so generously offered, you would save
   those lands once in my family from passing away from us forever. A
   city alderman&mdash;one Jobson&mdash;is meanly taking advantage of Thornhill's
   necessities, and driving a hard bargain for those lands. He has
   fixed the &mdash;th inst. for Thornhill's answer, and Levy (who is here
   assisting Mr. Egerton's election) informs me that Thornhill will
   accept his offer, unless I am provided with L10,000 beforehand; the
   other L10,000, to complete the advance required, Levy will lend me.
   Do not be surprised at the usurer's liberality; he knows that I am
   about shortly to marry a very great heiress (you will be pleased
   when you learn whom, and will then be able to account for my
   indifference to Miss Sticktorights), and her dower will amply serve
   to repay his loan and your own, if I may trust to your generous
   affection for the grandson of a Hazeldean! I have the less scruple
   in this appeal to you, for I know bow it would grieve you that a
   Jobson, who perhaps never knew a grandmother, should foist your own
   kinsman from the lands of his fathers. Of one thing I am
   convinced,&mdash;we squires and sons of squires must make common cause
   against those great moneyed capitalists, or they will buy us all out
   in a few generations. The old race of country gentlemen is already
   much diminished by the grasping cupidity of such leviathans; and if
   the race be once extinct, what will become of the boast and strength
   of England?

   Yours, my dear Mr. Hazeldean, with most affectionate and grateful
   respect,

               RANDAL LESLIE.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing to Leonard could as yet be more distasteful or oppressive than his
      share in this memorable election. In the first place, it chafed the secret
      sores of his heart to be compelled to resume the name of Fairfeld, which
      was a tacit disavowal of his birth. It had been such delight to him that
      the same letters which formed the name of Nora should weave also that name
      of Oran, to which he had given distinction, which he had associated with
      all his nobler toils, and all his hopes of enduring fame,&mdash;a mystic
      link between his own career and his mother's obscurer genius. It seemed to
      him as if it were rendering to her the honours accorded to himself,&mdash;subtle
      and delicate fancy of the affections, of which only poets would be
      capable, but which others than poets may perhaps comprehend! That earlier
      name of Fairfield was connected in his memory with all the ruder
      employments, the meaner trials of his boyhood; the name of Oran, with
      poetry and fame. It was his title in the ideal world, amongst all fair
      shapes and spirits. In receiving the old appellation, the practical world,
      with its bitterness and strife, returned to him as at the utterance of a
      spell. But in coming to Lansmere he had no choice. To say nothing of Dick,
      and Dick's parents with whom his secret would not be safe, Randal Leslie
      knew that he had gone by the name of Fairfield,&mdash;knew his supposed
      parentage, and would be sure to proclaim them. How account for the latter
      name without setting curiosity to decipher the anagram it involved, and
      perhaps guiding suspicion to his birth from Nora, to the injury of her
      memory, yet preserved from stain?
    </p>
    <p>
      His feelings as connected with Nora&mdash;sharpened and deepened as they
      all had been by his discovery of her painful narrative-were embittered
      still more by coming in contact with her parents. Old John was in the same
      helpless state of mind and body as before,&mdash;neither worse nor better;
      but waking up at intervals with vivid gleams of interest in the election
      at the wave of a blue banner, at the cry of "Blue forever!" It was the old
      broken-clown charger, who, dozing in the meadows, starts at the roll of
      the drum. No persuasions Dick could employ would induce his father to
      promise to vote even one Yellow. You might as well have expected the old
      Roman, with his monomaniac cry against Carthage, to have voted for
      choosing Carthaginians for consuls. But poor John, nevertheless, was not
      only very civil, but very humble to Dick,&mdash;"very happy to oblige the
      gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own son!" bawled Dick; "and here is your own grandson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very happy to serve you both; but you see you are the wrong colour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as he gazed at Leonard, the old man approached him with trembling
      knees, stroked his hair, looked into his face, piteously. "Be thee my
      grandson?" he faltered. "Wife, wife, Nora had no son, had she? My memory
      begins to fail me, sir; pray excuse it; but you have a look about the eyes
      that&mdash;" Old John began to weep, and his wife led him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't come again," she said to Leonard, harshly, when she returned.
      "He'll not sleep all night now." And then, observing that the tears stood
      in Leonard's eyes, she added, in softened tones, "I am glad to see you
      well and thriving, and to hear that you have been of great service to my
      son Richard, who is a credit and an honour to the family, though poor John
      cannot vote for him or for you against his conscience; and he should not
      be asked," she added, firing up; "and it is a sin to ask it, and he so
      old, and no one to defend him but me. But defend him I will while I have
      life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet recognized woman's brave, loving, wife-like heart here, and would
      have embraced the stern grandmother, if she had not drawn back from him;
      and, as she turned towards the room to which she had led her husband, she
      said over her shoulder,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not so unkind as I seem, boy; but it is better for you, and for all,
      that you should not come to this house again,&mdash;better that you had
      not come into the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fie, Mother!" said Dick, seeing that Leonard, bending his head, silently
      walked from the room. "You should be prouder of your grandson than you are
      of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prouder of him who may shame us all yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Avenel shook her head and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind her, poor old soul," said Dick, as he joined Leonard at the
      threshold; "she always had her tempers. And since there is no vote to be
      got in this house, and one can't set a caucus on one's own father,&mdash;at
      least in this extraordinary rotten and prejudiced old country, which is
      quite in its dotage,&mdash;we'll not come here to be snubbed any more.
      Bless their old hearts, nevertheless!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard's acute sensibility in all that concerned his birth, deeply
      wounded by Mrs. Avenel's allusions, which he comprehended better than his
      uncle did, was also kept on the edge by the suspense to which he was
      condemned by Harley's continued silence as to the papers confided to that
      nobleman. It seemed to Leonard almost unaccountable that Harley should
      have read those papers, be in the same town with himself, and yet
      volunteer no communication. At length he wrote a few lines to Lord
      L'Estrange, bringing the matter that concerned him so deeply before
      Harley's recollection, and suggesting his own earnest interest in any
      information that could supply the gaps and omissions of the desultory
      fragments. Harley, in replying to this note, said, with apparent reason,
      "that it would require a long personal interview to discuss the subject
      referred to, and that such an interview, in the thick of the contest
      between himself and a candidate opposed to the Lansmere party, would be
      sure to get wind, be ascribed to political intrigues, be impossible
      otherwise to explain, and embarrass all the interests confided to their
      respective charge. That for the rest, he had not been unmindful of
      Leonard's anxiety, which must now mainly be to see justice done to the
      dead parent, and learn the name, station, and character of the parent yet
      surviving. And in this Harley trusted to assist him as soon as the close
      of the poll would present a suitable occasion." The letter was unlike
      Harley's former cordial tone: it was hard and dry. Leonard respected
      L'Estrange too much to own to himself that it was unfeeling. With all his
      rich generosity of nature, he sought excuses for what he declined to
      blame. Perhaps something in Helen's manner or words had led Harley to
      suspect that she still cherished too tender an interest in the companion
      of her childhood; perhaps under this coldness of expression there lurked
      the burning anguish of jealousy. And, oh, Leonard so well understood, and
      could so nobly compassionate even in his prosperous rival, that torture of
      the most agonizing of human passions, in which all our reasonings follow
      the distorted writhings of our pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Leonard himself, amidst his other causes of disquiet, was at once so
      gnawed and so humbled by his own jealousy. Helen, he knew, was still under
      the same roof as Harley. They, the betrothed, could see each other daily,
      hourly. He would soon hear of their marriage. She would be borne afar from
      the very sphere of his existence,&mdash;carried into a loftier region,
      accessible only to his dreams. And yet to be jealous of one to whom both
      Helen and himself were under such obligations debased him in his own
      esteem,&mdash;jealousy here was so like ingratitude. But for Harley, what
      could have become of Helen, left to his boyish charge,&mdash;he who had
      himself been compelled, in despair, to think of sending her from his side,
      to be reared into smileless youth in his mother's humble cottage, while he
      faced famine alone, gazing on the terrible river, from the bridge by which
      he had once begged for very alms,&mdash;begged of that Audley Egerton to
      whom he was now opposed as an equal; or flying from the fiend that glared
      at him under the lids of the haunting Chatterton? No, jealousy here was
      more than agony,&mdash;it was degradation, it was crime! But, all! if
      Helen were happy in these splendid nuptials! Was he sure even of that
      consolation? Bitter was the thought either way,&mdash;that she should
      wholly forget him, in happiness from which he stood excluded as a thing of
      sin; or sinfully herself remember, and be wretched!
    </p>
    <p>
      With that healthful strength of will which is more often proportioned to
      the susceptibility of feeling than the world suppose, the young man at
      last wrenched himself for awhile from the iron that had entered into his
      soul, and forced his thoughts to seek relief in the very objects from
      which they otherwise would have the most loathingly recoiled. He aroused
      his imagination to befriend his reason; he strove to divine some motive
      not explained by Harley, not to be referred to the mere defeat, by
      counter-scheme, of the scheming Randal, nor even to be solved by any
      service to Audley Egerton, which Harley might evolve from the complicated
      meshes of the election,&mdash;some motive that could more interest his own
      heart in the contest, and connect itself with Harley's promised aid in
      clearing up the mystery of his parentage. Nora's memoir had clearly hinted
      that his father was of rank and station far beyond her own. She had thrown
      the glow of her glorious fancies over the ambition and the destined career
      of the lover in whom she had merged her ambition as poetess, and her
      career as woman. Possibly the father might be more disposed to own and to
      welcome the son, if the son could achieve an opening, and give promise of
      worth, in that grand world of public life in which alone reputation takes
      precedence of rank. Possibly, too, if the son thus succeeded, and became
      one whom a proud father could with pride acknowledge, possibly he might
      not only secure a father's welcome, but vindicate a mother's name. This
      marriage, which Nora darkly hinted she had been led to believe was
      fraudulent, might, after all, have been legal,&mdash;the ceremony
      concealed, even till now, by worldly shame at disparity of rank. But if
      the son could make good his own footing&mdash;there where rank itself
      owned its chiefs in talent&mdash;that shame might vanish. These
      suppositions were not improbable; nor were they uncongenial to Leonard's
      experience of Harley's delicate benignity of purpose. Here, too, the image
      of Helen allied itself with those of his parents, to support his courage
      and influence his new ambition. True, that she was lost to him forever. No
      worldly success, no political honours, could now restore her to his side.
      But she might hear him named with respect in those circles in which alone
      she would hereafter move, and in which parliamentary reputation ranks
      higher than literary fame. And perhaps in future years, when love,
      retaining its tenderness, was purified from its passion, they might thus
      meet as friends. He might without a pang take her children on his knees,
      and say, perhaps in their old age, when he had climbed to a social
      equality even with her high-born lord, "It was the hope to regain the
      privilege bestowed on our childhood, that strengthened me to seek
      distinction when you and happiness forsook my youth." Thus regarded, the
      election, which had before seemed to him so poor and vulgar an exhibition
      of vehement passions for petty objects, with its trumpery of banners and
      its discord of trumpets, suddenly grew into vivid interest, and assumed
      dignity and importance. It is ever thus with all mortal strife. In
      proportion as it possesses, or is void of, the diviner something that
      quickens the pulse of the heart, and elevates the wing of the imagination,
      it presents a mockery to the philosopher, or an inspiration to the bard.
      Feel that something, and no contest is mean! Feel it not, and, like Byron,
      you may class with the slaughter of Cannae that field which, at Waterloo,
      restored the landmarks of nations; or may jeer with Juvenal at the dust of
      Hannibal, because he sought to deliver Carthage from ruin, and free a
      world from Rome.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once then, grappling manfully with the task he had undertaken, and
      constraining himself to look on what Riccabocca would have called "the
      southern side of things," whatever there was really great in principle or
      honourable to human nature, deep below the sordid details and pitiful
      interests apparent on the face of the agitated current, came clear to his
      vision. The ardour of those around him began to be contagious: the
      generous devotion to some cause apart from self, which pervades an
      election, and to which the poorest voter will often render sacrifices that
      may be called sublime; the warm personal affection which community of zeal
      creates for the defender of beloved opinions,&mdash;all concurred to
      dispel that indifference to party politics, and counteract that disgust of
      their baser leaven, which the young poet had first conceived. He even
      began to look with complacency, for itself, on a career of toil and
      honours strange to his habitual labours and intellectual ambition. He
      threw the poetry of idea within him (as poets ever do) into the prose of
      action to which he was hurried forward. He no longer opposed Dick Avenel
      when that gentleman represented how detrimental it would be to his
      business at Screwstown if he devoted to his country the time and the
      acumen required by his mill and its steamengine; and how desirable it
      would be, on all accounts, that Leonard Fairfield should become the
      parliamentary representative of the Avenels. "If, therefore," said Dick,
      "two of us cannot come in, and one must retire, leave it to me to arrange
      with the Committee that you shall be the one to persist. Oh, never fear
      but what all scruples of honour shall be satisfied. I would not for the
      sake of the Avenels have a word said against their representative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," answered Leonard, "if I grant this, I fear that you have some
      intention of suffering the votes that your resignation would release to
      favour Leslie at the expense of Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce is Egerton to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, except through my gratitude to his friend Lord L'Estrange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh! I will tell you a secret. Levy informs me privately that L'Estrange
      will be well satisfied if the choice of Lansmere fall upon Leslie instead
      of Egerton; and I think I convinced my Lord&mdash;for I saw him in London&mdash;that
      Egerton would have no chance, though Leslie might."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must think that Lord L'Estrange would resist to the utmost any attempt
      to prefer Leslie&mdash;whom he despises&mdash;to Egerton, whom he honours.
      And, so thinking, I too would resist it, as you may judge by the speeches
      which have so provoked your displeasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us cut short a yarn of talk which, when it comes to likings and
      dislikings, might last to almighty crack: I'll ask you to do nothing that
      Lord L'Estrange does not sanction. Will that satisfy you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, provided I am assured of the sanction."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, the important day preceding the poll, the day in which the
      candidates were to be formally nominated, and meet each other in all the
      ceremony of declared rivalship, dawned at last. The town-hall was the
      place selected for the occasion; and before sunrise, all the streets were
      resonant with music, and gay with banners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley Egerton felt that he could not&mdash;without incurring some just
      sarcasm on his dread to face the constituency he had formerly represented,
      and by the malcontents of which he had been burned in effigy&mdash;absent
      himself from the townhall, as he had done from balcony and hostel. Painful
      as it was to confront Nora's brother, and wrestle in public against all
      the secret memories that knit the strife of the present contest with the
      anguish that recalled the first,&mdash;still the thing must be done; and
      it was the English habit of his life to face with courage whatever he had
      to do.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The chiefs of the Blue party went in state from Lansmere Park; the two
      candidates in open carriages, each attended with his proposer and
      seconder. Other carriages were devoted to Harley and Levy, and the
      principal members of the Committee. Riccabocca was seized with a fit of
      melancholy or cynicism, and declined to join the procession. But just
      before they started, as all were assembling without the front door, the
      postman arrived with his welcome bag. There were letters for Harley, some
      for Levy, many for Egerton, one for Randal Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy, soon hurrying over his own correspondence, looked, in the familiar
      freedom wherewith he usually treated his particular friends, over Randal's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the squire?" said he. "Ah, he has written at last! What made him
      delay so long? Hope he relieves your mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," cried Randal, giving way to a joy that rarely lighted up his close
      and secret countenance,&mdash;"yes, he does not write from Hazeldean,&mdash;not
      there when my letter arrived, in London, could not rest at the Hall,&mdash;the
      place reminded him too much of Frank;&mdash;went again to town, on the
      receipt of my first letter concerning the rupture of the marriage, to see
      after his son, and take up some money to pay off his post-obit. Read what
      he says:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "'So, while I was about a mortgage&mdash;never did I guess that I should
   be the man to encumber the Hazeldean estate&mdash;I thought I might as
   well add L20,000 as L10,000 to the total. Why should you be
   indebted at all to that Baron Levy? Don't have dealings with money-
   lenders. Your grandmother was a Hazeldean; and from a Hazeldean you
   shall have the whole sum required in advance for those Rood lands,&mdash;
   good light soil some of them. As to repayment, we'll talk of that
   later. If Frank and I come together again, as we did of old, why,
   my estates will be his some day, and he'll not grudge the mortgage,
   so fond as he always was of you; and if we don't come together, what
   do I care for hundreds or thousands, either more or less? So I
   shall be down at Lansmere the day after to-morrow, just in the thick
   of your polling. Beat the manufacturer, my boy, and stick up for
   the land. Tell Levy to have all ready. I shall bring the money
   down in good bank-notes, and a brace of pistols in my coat pocket to
   take care of them in ease robbers get scent of the notes and attack
   me on the road, as they did my grandfather sixty years ago, come
   next Michaelmas. A Lansmere election puts one in mind of pistols.
   I once fought a duel with an officer in his Majesty's service, R.N.,
   and had a ball lodged in my right shoulder, on account of an
   election at Lansmere; but I have forgiven Audley his share in that
   transaction. Remember me to him kindly. Don't get into a duel
   yourself; but I suppose manufacturers don't fight,&mdash;not that I blame
   them for that&mdash;far from it.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      The letter then ran on to express surprise, and hazard conjecture, as to
      the wealthy marriage which Randal had announced as a pleasing surprise to
      the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Levy, returning the letter, "you must have written as
      cleverly as you talk, or the squire is a booby indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal smiled, pocketed his letter, and responding to the impatient call
      of his proposer, sprang lightly into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley, too, seemed pleased with the letters delivered to himself, and now
      joined Levy, as the candidates drove slowly off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has not Mr. Leslie received from the squire an answer to that letter of
      which you informed me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Lord, the squire will be here to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow? Thank you for apprising me; his rooms shall be prepared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose he will only stay to see Leslie and myself, and pay the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha! Pay the money. Is it so, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twice the sum, and, it seems, as a gift, which Leslie only asked as a
      loan. Really, my Lord, Mr. Leslie is a very clever man; and though I am at
      your commands, I should not like to injure him. With such matrimonial
      prospects, he could be a very powerful enemy; and if he succeed in
      parliament, still more so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baron, these gentlemen are waiting for you. I will follow by myself."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the centre of the raised platform in the town-hall sat the mayor. On
      either hand of that dignitary now appeared the candidates of the
      respective parties,&mdash;to his right, Audley Egerton and Leslie; to his
      left, Dick Avenel and Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was as full as it could hold. Rows of grimy faces peeped in,
      even from the upper windows outside the building. The contest was one that
      created intense interest, not only from public principles, but local
      passions. Dick Avenel, the son of a small tradesman, standing against the
      Right Honourable Audley Egerton, the choice of the powerful Lansmere
      aristocratic party,&mdash;standing, too, with his nephew by his side;
      taking, as he himself was wont to say, "the tarnation Blue Bull by both
      its oligarchical horns!"&mdash;there was a pluck and gallantry in the very
      impudence of the attempt to convert the important borough&mdash;for one
      member of which a great earl had hitherto striven, "with labour dire and
      weary woe" into two family seats for the House of Avenel and the triumph
      of the Capelocracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This alone would have excited all the spare passions of a country borough;
      but, besides this, there was the curiosity that attached to the
      long-deferred public appearance of a candidate so renowned as the
      ex-minister,&mdash;a man whose career had commenced with his success at
      Lansmere, and who now, amidst the popular tempest that scattered his
      colleagues, sought to refit his vessel in the same harbour from which it
      had first put forth. New generations had grown up since the name of Audley
      Egerton had first fluttered the dovecotes in that Corioli. The questions
      that had then seemed so important were, for the most part, settled and at
      rest. But those present who remembered Egerton in the former day, were
      struck to see how the same characteristics of bearing and aspect which had
      distinguished his early youth revived their interest in the mature and
      celebrated man. As he stood up for a few moments, before he took his seat
      beside the mayor, glancing over the assembly, with its uproar of cheers
      and hisses, there was the same stately erectness of form and steadfastness
      of look, the same indefinable and mysterious dignity of externals, that
      imposed respect, confirmed esteem, or stilled dislike. The hisses
      involuntarily ceased.

    <p>
      The preliminary proceedings over, the proposers and seconders commenced
      their office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley was proposed, of course, by the crack man of the party,&mdash;a
      gentleman who lived on his means in a white house in the High Street, had
      received a University education, and was a cadet of a "County Family."
      This gentleman spoke much about the Constitution, something about Greece
      and Rome; compared Egerton with William Pitt, also with Aristides; and sat
      down, after an oration esteemed classical by the few, and pronounced prosy
      by the many. Audley's seconder, a burly and important maltster, struck a
      bolder key. He dwelt largely upon the necessity of being represented by
      gentlemen of wealth and rank, and not by "upstarts and adventurers."
      (Cheers and groans.) "Looking at the candidates on the other side, it was
      an insult to the respectability of Lansmere to suppose its constituents
      could elect a man who had no pretensions whatever to their notice, except
      that he had once been a little boy in the town, in which his father kept a
      shop,&mdash;and a very noisy, turbulent, dirty little boy he was!" Dick
      smoothed his spotless shirt-front, and looked daggers, while the Blues
      laughed heartily, and the Yellows cried "Shame!" "As for the other
      candidate on the same side, he [the maltster] had nothing to say against
      him.&mdash;He was, no doubt, seduced into presumption by his uncle and his
      own inexperience. It was said that that candidate, Mr. Fairfield, was an
      author and a poet; if so, he was unknown to fame, for no bookseller in the
      town had ever even heard of Mr. Fairfield's works. Then it was replied Mr.
      Fairfield had written under another name. What would that prove? Either
      that he was ashamed of his name, or that the works did him no credit. For
      his part, he [the maltster] was an Englishman; he did not like anonymous
      scribblers; there was something not right in whatever was concealed. A man
      should never be afraid to put his name to what he wrote. But grant that
      Mr. Fairfield was a great author and a great poet, what the borough of
      Lansinere wanted was, not a member who would pass his time in writing
      sonnets to Peggy or Moggy, but a practical man of business,&mdash;a
      statesman,&mdash;such a man as Mr. Audley Egerton, a gentleman of ancient
      birth, high standing, and princely fortune. The member for such a place as
      Lansmere should have a proper degree of wealth." ("Hear, hear!" from the
      Hundred and Fifty Hesitators, who all stood in a row at the bottom of the
      hall; and "Gammon!" "Stuff!" from some revolutionary but incorruptible
      Yellows.) Still the allusion to Egerton's private fortune had considerable
      effect with the bulk of the audience, and the maltster was much cheered on
      concluding. Mr. Avenel's proposer and seconder&mdash;the one a large
      grocer, the other the proprietor of a new shop for ticketed prints,
      shawls, blankets, and counterpanes,&mdash;a man, who, as he boasted, dealt
      with the People for ready money, and no mistake, at least none that he
      ever rectified&mdash;next followed. Both said much the same thing. Mr.
      Avenel had made his fortune by honest industry, was a fellow-townsman,
      must know the interests of the town better than strangers, upright public
      principles, never fawn on governments, would see that the people had their
      rights, and cut down army, navy, and all other jobs of a corrupt
      aristocracy, etc. Randal Leslie's proposer, a captain on half-pay,
      undertook a long defence of army and navy, from the unpatriotic aspersions
      of the preceding speakers, which defence diverted him from the due praise
      of Randal, until cries of "Cut it short," recalled him to that subject;
      and then the topics he selected for eulogium were "amiability of
      character, so conspicuous in the urbane manners of his young friend;"
      "coincidence in the opinions of that illustrious statesman with whom he
      was conjoined;" "early tuition in the best principles; only fault, youth,&mdash;and
      that was a fault which would diminish every day." Randal's seconder was a
      bluff yeoman, an outvoter of weight with the agricultural electors. He was
      too straightforward by half,&mdash;adverted to Audley Egerton's early
      desertion of questions espoused by landed interest, hoped he had had
      enough of the large towns; and he (the yeoman) was ready to forgive and
      forget, but trusted that there would be no chance of burning their member
      again in effigy. As to the young gentleman, whose nomination he had the
      pleasure to second, did not know much about him; but the Leslies were an
      old family in the neighbouring county, and Mr. Leslie said he was nearly
      related to Squire Hazeldean,&mdash;as good a man as ever stood upon shoe
      leather. He (the yeoman) liked a good breed in sheep and bullocks; and a
      good breed in men he supposed was the same thing. He (the yeoman) was not
      for abuses,&mdash;he was for King and Constitution. He should have no
      objection, for instance, to have tithes lowered, and the malt-tax
      repealed,&mdash;not the least objection. Mr. Leslie seemed to him a likely
      young chap, and uncommon well-spoken; and, on the whole, for aught he (the
      yeoman) could see, would do quite as well in parliament as nine-tenths of
      the gentlemen sent there. The yeoman sat down, little cheered by the
      Blues, much by the Yellows, and with a dim consciousness that somehow or
      other he had rather damaged than not the cause of the party he had been
      chosen to advocate. Leonard was not particularly fortunate in his
      proposer, a youngish gentleman, who, having tried various callings, with
      signal unsuccess, had come into a small independence, and set up for a
      literary character. This gentleman undertook the defence of poets, as the
      half-pay captain had undertaken that of the army and navy; and after a
      dozen sentences spoken through the nose, about the "moonlight of
      existence," and "the oasis in the desert," suddenly broke down, to the
      satisfaction of his impatient listeners. This failure was, however,
      redeemed by Leonard's seconder, a master tailor, a practised speaker and
      an earnest, thinking man, sincerely liking and warmly admiring Leonard
      Fairfield. His opinions were delivered with brief simplicity, and
      accompanied by expressions of trust in Leonard's talents and honesty, that
      were effective, because expressed with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      These preparatory orations over, a dead silence succeeded, and Audley
      Egerton arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first few sentences, all felt they were in the presence of one
      accustomed to command attention, and to give to opinions the weight of
      recognized authority. The slowness of the measured accents, the composure
      of the manly aspect, the decorum of the simple gestures,&mdash;all bespoke
      and all became the minister of a great empire, who had less agitated
      assemblies by impassioned eloquence, than compelled their silent respect
      to the views of sagacity and experience. But what might have been formal
      and didactic in another was relieved in Egerton by that air, tone, bearing
      of gentleman, which have a charm for the most plebeian audience. He had
      eminently these attributes in private life; but they became far more
      conspicuous whenever he had to appear in public. The "senatorius decor"
      seemed a phrase coined for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley commenced with notice of his adversaries in that language of high
      courtesy which is so becoming to superior station, and which augurs better
      for victory than the most pointed diatribes of hostile declamation.
      Inclining his head towards Avenel, he expressed regret that he should be
      opposed by a gentleman whose birth naturally endeared him to the town, of
      which he was a distinguished native, and whose honourable ambition was in
      itself a proof of the admirable nature of that Constitution, which
      admitted the lowliest to rise to its distinctions, while it compelled the
      loftiest to labour and compete for those honours which were the most
      coveted, because they were derived from the trust of their countrymen, and
      dignified by the duties which the sense of responsibility entailed. He
      paid a passing but generous compliment to the reputed abilities of Leonard
      Fairfield; and alluding with appropriate grace to the interest he had ever
      taken in the success of youth striving for place in the van of the new
      generation that marched on to replace the old, he implied that he did not
      consider Leonard as opposed to himself, but rather as an emulous
      competitor for a worthy prize with his "own young and valued friend, Mr.
      Randal Leslie." "They are happy at their years!" said the statesman, with
      a certain pathos. "In the future they see nothing to fear, in the past
      they have nothing to defend. It is not so with me." And then, passing on
      to the vague insinuations or bolder charges against himself and his policy
      proffered by the preceding speakers, Audley gathered himself up, and
      paused; for his eye here rested on the Reporters seated round the table
      just below him; and he recognized faces not unfamiliar to his recollection
      when metropolitan assemblies had hung on the words which fell from lips
      then privileged to advise a king. And involuntarily it occurred to the
      ex-minister to escape altogether from this contracted audience,&mdash;this
      election, with all its associations of pain,&mdash;and address himself
      wholly to that vast and invisible Public, to which those Reporters would
      transmit his ideas. At this thought his whole manner gradually changed.
      His eye became fixed on the farthest verge of the crowd; his tones grew
      more solemn in their deep and sonorous swell. He began to review and to
      vindicate his whole political life. He spoke of the measures he had aided
      to pass, of his part in the laws which now ruled the land. He touched
      lightly, but with pride, on the services he had rendered to the opinions
      he had represented. He alluded to his neglect of his own private fortunes;
      but in what detail, however minute, in the public business committed to
      his charge, could even an enemy accuse him of neglect? The allusion was no
      doubt intended to prepare the public for the news that the wealth of
      Audley Egerton was gone. Finally, he came to the questions that then
      agitated the day; and made a general but masterly exposition of the policy
      which, under the changes he foresaw, he should recommend his party to
      adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spoken to the motley assembly in that town-hall, Audley's speech extended
      to a circle of interest too wide for their sympathy. But that assembly he
      heeded not,&mdash;he forgot it. The reporters understood him, as their
      flying pens followed words which they presumed neither to correct nor to
      abridge. Audley's speech was addressed to the nation,&mdash;the speech of
      a man in whom the nation yet recognized a chief, desiring to clear all
      misrepresentation from his past career; calculating, if life were spared
      to him, on destinies higher than he had yet fulfilled; issuing a manifesto
      of principles to be carried later into power, and planting a banner round
      which the divided sections of a broken host might yet rally for battle and
      for conquest. Or perhaps, in the deeps of his heart (not even comprehended
      by reporters, nor to be divined by the public), the uncertainty of life
      was more felt than the hope of ambition; and the statesman desired to
      leave behind him one full vindication of that public integrity and honour,
      on which, at least, his conscience acknowledged not a stain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For more than twenty years," said Audley, in conclusion, "I have known no
      day in which I have not lived for my country. I may at times have opposed
      the wish of the People,&mdash;I may oppose it now; but, so far as I can
      form a judgment, only because I prefer their welfare to their wish. And if&mdash;as
      I believe&mdash;there have been occasions on which, as one amongst men
      more renowned, I have amended the laws of England, confirmed her safety,
      extended her commerce, upheld her honour, I leave the rest to the censure
      of my enemies, and [his voice trembled] to the charity of my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the cheers that greeted the close of this speech were over, Richard
      Avenel arose. What is called "the more respectable part" of an audience&mdash;namely,
      the better educated and better clad, even on the Yellow side of the
      question&mdash;winced a little for the credit of their native borough,
      when they contemplated the candidate pitted against the Great Commoner,
      whose lofty presence still filled the eye, and whose majestic tones yet
      sounded in the ear. But the vast majority on both sides, Blue and Yellow,
      hailed the rise of Dick Avenel as a relief to what, while it had awed
      their attention, had rather strained their faculties. The Yellows cheered
      and the Blues groaned; there was a tumultuous din of voices, and a reel to
      and fro of the whole excited mass of unwashed faces and brawny shoulders.
      But Dick had as much pluck as Audley himself; and by degrees, his pluck
      and his handsome features, and the curiosity to hear what he had to say,
      obtained him a hearing; and that hearing Dick having once got, he
      contrived to keep. His self-confidence was backed by a grudge against
      Egerton, that attained to the elevation of malignity. He had armed himself
      for this occasion with an arsenal of quotations from Audley's speeches,
      taken out of Hansard's Debates; and, garbling these texts in the unfairest
      and most ingenious manner, he contrived to split consistency into such
      fragments of inconsistency&mdash;to cut so many harmless sentences into
      such unpopular, arbitrary, tyrannical segments of doctrine&mdash;that he
      made a very pretty case against the enlightened and incorruptible Egerton,
      as shuffler and trimmer, defender of jobs, and eulogist of Manchester
      massacres, etc. And all told the more because it seemed courted and
      provoked by the ex-minister's elaborate vindication of himself. Having
      thus, as he declared, "triumphantly convicted the Right Honourable
      Gentleman out of his own mouth," Dick considered himself at liberty to
      diverge into what he termed "the just indignation of a freeborn Briton;"
      in other words, into every variety of abuse which bad taste could supply
      to acrimonious feeling. But he did it so roundly and dauntlessly, in such
      true hustings style, that for the moment, at least, he carried the bulk of
      the crowd along with him sufficiently to bear down all the resentful
      murmurs of the Blue Committee men, and the abashed shakes of the head with
      which the more aristocratic and well-bred among the Yellows signified to
      each other that they were heartily ashamed of their candidate. Dick
      concluded with an emphatic declaration that the Right Honourable
      Gentleman's day was gone by; that the people had been pillaged and
      plundered enough by pompous red-tapists, who only thought of their
      salaries, and never went to their offices except to waste the pen, ink,
      and paper which they did not pay for; that the Right Honourable Gentleman
      had boasted he had served his country for twenty years. Served his
      country!&mdash;he should have said served her out! (Much laughter.) Pretty
      mess his country was in now. In short, for twenty years the Right
      Honourable Gentleman had put his hands into his country's pockets. "And I
      ask you," bawled Dick, "whether any of you are a bit the better for all
      that he has taken out of them!" The Hundred and Fifty Hesitators shook
      their heads. "Noa, that we ben't!" cried the Hundred and Fifty,
      dolorously. "You hear THE PEOPLE!" said Dick, turning majestically to
      Egerton, who, with his arms folded on his breast, and his upper lip
      slightly curved, sat like "Atlas unremoved,"&mdash;"you hear THE PEOPLE!
      They condemn you and the whole set of you. I repeat here what I once vowed
      on a less public occasion, 'As sure as my name is Richard Avenel, you
      shall smart for'&mdash;Dick hesitated&mdash;'smart for your contempt of
      the just rights, honest claims, and enlightened aspirations of your
      indignant countrymen. The schoolmaster is abroad, and the British Lion is
      aroused!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick sat down. The curve of contempt had passed from Egerton's lip; at the
      name of Avenel, thus harshly spoken, he had suddenly shaded his face with
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Randal Leslie next arose, and Audley slowly raised his eyes, and
      looked towards his protege with an expression of kindly interest. What
      better debut could there be for a young man warmly attached to an eminent
      patron who had been coarsely assailed,&mdash;for a political aspirant
      vindicating the principles which that patron represented? The Blues,
      palpitating with indignant excitement, all prepared to cheer every
      sentence that could embody their sense of outrage, even the meanest
      amongst the Yellows, now that Dick had concluded, dimly aware that their
      orator had laid himself terribly open, and richly deserved (more
      especially from the friend of Audley Egerton) whatever punishing retort
      could vibrate from the heart of a man to the tongue of an orator. A better
      opportunity for an honest young debutant could not exist; a more
      disagreeable, annoying, perplexing, unmanageable opportunity for Randal
      Leslie, the malice of the Fates could not have contrived. How could he
      attack Dick Avenel,&mdash;he who counted upon Dick Avenel to win his
      election? How could he exasperate the Yellows, when Dick's solemn
      injunction had been, "Say nothing to make the Yellows not vote for you"?
      How could he identify himself with Egerton's policy, when it was his own
      policy to make his opponents believe him an unprejudiced, sensible youth,
      who would come all right and all Yellow one of these days? Demosthenes
      himself would have had a sore throat worse than when he swallowed the
      golden cup of Harpalus, had Demosthenes been placed in so cursed a fix.
      Therefore Randal Leslie may well be excused if he stammered and boggled,
      if he was appalled by a cheer when he said a word in vindication of
      Egerton, and looked cringing and pitiful when he sneaked out a counter
      civility to Dick. The Blues were sadly disappointed, damped; the Yellows
      smirked and took heart. Audley Egerton's brows darkened. Harley, who was
      on the platform, half seen behind the front row, a quiet listener, bent
      over and whispered dryly to Audley, "You should have given a lesson
      beforehand to your clever young friend. His affection for you overpowers
      him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley made no rejoinder, but tore a leaf out of his pocketbook, and
      wrote, in pencil, these words, "Say that you may well feel embarrassed how
      to reply to Mr. Avenel, because I had especially requested you not to be
      provoked to one angry expression against a gentleman whose father and
      brother-in-law gave the majority of two by which I gained my first seat in
      parliament; then plunge at once into general politics." He placed this
      paper in Randal's hand, just as that unhappy young man was on the point of
      a thorough breakdown. Randal paused, took breath, read the words
      attentively, and amidst a general titter; his presence of mind returned to
      him; he saw a way out of the scrape, collected himself, suddenly raised
      his head, and in tones unexpectedly firm and fluent, enlarged on the text
      afforded to him,&mdash;enlarged so well that he took the audience by
      surprise, pleased the Blues by an evidence of Audley's generosity, and
      touched the Yellows by so affectionate a deference to the family of their
      two candidates. Then the speaker was enabled to come at once to the topics
      on which he had elaborately prepared himself, and delivered a set
      harangue, very artfully put together,&mdash;temporizing it is true, and
      trimming, but full of what would have been called admirable tact and
      discretion in an old stager who did not want to commit himself to anybody
      or to anything. On the whole, the display became creditable, at least as
      an evidence of thoughtful reserve, rare in a man so young; too refining
      and scholastic for oratory, but a very good essay,&mdash;upon both sides
      of the question. Randal wiped his pale forehead and sat down, cheered,
      especially by the lawyers present, and self-contented. It was now
      Leonard's turn to speak. Keenly nervous, as men of the literary
      temperament are, constitutionally shy, his voice trembled as he began. But
      he trusted, unconsciously, less to his intellect than his warm heart and
      noble temper; and the warm heart prompted his words, and the noble temper
      gradually dignified his manner. He took advantage of the sentences which
      Audley had put into Randal's mouth, in order to efface the impression made
      by his uncle's rude assault. "Would that the Right Honourable Gentleman
      had himself made that generous and affecting allusion to the services
      which he had deigned to remember, for, in that case, he [Leonard] was
      confident that Mr. Avenel would have lost all the bitterness which
      political contest was apt to engender in proportion to the earnestness
      with which political opinions were entertained. Happy it was when some
      such milder sentiment as that which Mr. Egerton had instructed Mr. Leslie
      to convey, preceded the sharp encounter, and reminded antagonists, as Mr.
      Leslie had so emphatically done, that every shield had two sides, and that
      it was possible to maintain the one side to be golden, without denying the
      truth of the champion who asserted the other side to be silver." Then,
      without appearing to throw over his uncle, the young speaker contrived to
      insinuate an apology on his uncle's behalf, with such exquisite grace and
      good feeling, that he was loudly cheered by both parties; and even Dick
      did not venture to utter the dissent which struggled to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Leonard dealt thus respectfully with Egerton, he had no such
      inducement to spare Randal Leslie. With the intuitive penetration of minds
      accustomed to analyze character and investigate human nature, he detected
      the varnished insincerity of Randal's artful address. His colour rose, his
      voice swelled, his fancy began to play, and his wit to sparkle, when he
      came to take to pieces his younger antagonist's rhetorical mosaic. He
      exposed the falsehood of its affected moderation; he tore into shreds the
      veil of words, with their motley woof of yellow and blue, and showed that
      not a single conviction could be discovered behind it. "Mr. Leslie's
      speech," said he, "puts me in mind of a ferry-boat; it seems made for no
      purpose but to go from one side to the other." The simile hit the truth so
      exactly that it was received with a roar of laughter: even Egerton smiled.
      "For myself," concluded Leonard, as he summed up his unsparing analysis,
      "I am new to party warfare; yet if I were not opposing Mr. Leslie as a
      candidate for your suffrages, if I were but an elector,&mdash;belonging,
      as I do, to the people by my condition and my labours,&mdash;I should feel
      that he is one of those politicians in whom the welfare, the honour, the
      moral elevation of the people, find no fitting representative."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard sat down amidst great applause, and after a speech that raised the
      Yellows in their own estimation, and materially damaged Randal Leslie in
      the eyes of the Blues. Randal felt this, with a writhing of the heart,
      though a sneer on the lips. He glanced furtively towards Dick Avenel, on
      whom, after all, his election, in spite of the Blues, might depend. Dick
      answered the furtive glance by an encouraging wink. Randal turned to
      Egerton, and whispered to him, "How I wish I had had more practice in
      speaking, so that I could have done you more justice!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Leslie; Mr. Fairfield has supplied any omission of yours, so
      far as I am concerned. And you should excuse him for his attack on
      yourself, because it may serve to convince you where your fault as a
      speaker lies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" asked Leslie, with jealous sullenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In not believing a single word that you say," answered Egerton, very
      dryly; and then turning away, he said aloud to his proposer, and with a
      slight sigh, "Mr. Avenel maybe proud of his nephew! I wish that young man
      were on our side; I could train him into a great debater."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the proceedings were about to terminate with a show of hands, when
      a tall, brawny elector in the middle of the hall suddenly arose, and said
      he had some questions to put. A thrill ran through the assembly, for this
      elector was the demagogue of the Yellows,&mdash;a fellow whom it was
      impossible to put down, a capital speaker, with lungs of brass. "I shall
      be very short," said the demagogue. And therewith, under the shape of
      questions to the two Blue candidates, he commenced a most furious
      onslaught on the Earl of Lansmere, and the earl's son, Lord L'Estrange,
      accusing the last of the grossest intimidation and corruption, and citing
      instances thereof as exhibited towards various electors in Fish Lane and
      the Back Slums, who had been turned from Yellow promises by the base arts
      of Blue aristocracy, represented in the person of the noble lord, whom he
      now dared to reply. The orator paused, and Harley suddenly passed into the
      front of the platform, in token that he accepted the ungracious
      invitation. Great as had been the curiosity to hear Audley Egerton, yet
      greater, if possible, was the curiosity to hear Lord L'Estrange. Absent
      from the place for so many years, heir to such immense possessions, with a
      vague reputation for talents that he had never proved,&mdash;strange,
      indeed, if Blue and Yellow had not strained their ears and hushed their
      breaths to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that the poet is born, and the orator made,&mdash;a saying only
      partially true. Some men have been made poets, and some men have been born
      orators. Most probably Harley L'Estrange had hitherto never spoken in
      public; and he had not now spoken five minutes before all the passions and
      humours of the assembly were as much under his command as the keys of the
      instrument are under the hands of the musician. He had taken from nature a
      voice capable of infinite variety of modulation, a countenance of the most
      flexible play of expression; and he was keenly alive (as profound
      humourists are) equally to the ludicrous and the graver side of everything
      presented to his vigorous understanding. Leonard had the eloquence of a
      poet, Audley Egerton that of a parliamentary debater; but Harley had the
      rarer gift of eloquence in itself, apart from the matter it conveys or
      adorns,&mdash;that gift which Demosthenes meant by his triple requisite of
      an orator, which has been improperly translated "action," but means in
      reality "the acting," "the stage-play." Both Leonard and Audley spoke
      well, from the good sense which their speeches contained; but Harley could
      have talked nonsense, and made it more effective than sense,&mdash;even as
      a Kemble or Macready could produce effects from the trash talked by "The
      Stranger," which your merely accomplished performer would fail to extract
      from the beauties of Hamlet. The art of oratory, indeed, is allied more
      closely to that of the drama than to any other; and throughout Harley's
      whole nature there ran, as the reader may have noted (though quite
      unconsciously to Harley himself), a tendency towards that concentration of
      thought, action, and circumstance on a single purpose, which makes the
      world form itself into a stage, and gathers various and scattered agencies
      into the symmetry and compactness of a drama. This tendency, though it
      often produces effects that appear artificially theatrical, is not
      uncommon with persons the most genuine and single-minded. It is, indeed,
      the natural inclination of quick energies springing from warm emotions.
      Hence the very history of nations in their fresh, vigorous, half-civilized
      youth always shapes itself into dramatic forms; while, as the exercise of
      sober reason expands with civilization, to the injury of the livelier
      faculties and more intuitive impulses, people look to the dramatic form of
      expression, whether in thought or in action, as if it were the antidote to
      truth, instead of being its abstract and essence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return from this long and somewhat metaphysical digression:
      whatever might be the cause why Harley L'Estrange spoke so wonderfully
      well, there could be no doubt that wonderfully well he did speak. He
      turned the demagogue and his attack into the most felicitous ridicule, and
      yet with the most genial good-humour; described that virtuous gentleman's
      adventures in search of corruption through the pure regions of Fish Lane
      and the Back Slums; and then summed up the evidences on which the
      demagogue had founded his charge, with a humour so caustic and original
      that the audience were convulsed with laughter. From laughter Harley
      hurried his audience almost to the pathos of tears,&mdash;for he spoke of
      the insinuations against his father so that every son and every father in
      the assembly felt moved as at the voice of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A turn in a sentence, and a new emotion seized the assembly. Harley was
      identifying himself with the Lansmere electors. He spoke of his pride in
      being a Lansmere man, and all the Lansmere electors suddenly felt proud of
      him. He talked with familiar kindness of old friends remembered in his
      schoolboy holidays, rejoicing to find so many alive and prospering. He had
      a felicitous word to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear old Lansmere!" said he, and the simple exclamation won him the
      hearts of all. In fine, when he paused, as if to retire, it was amidst a
      storm of acclamation. Audley grasped his hand, and whispered, "I am the
      only one here not surprised, Harley. Now you have discovered your powers,
      never again let them slumber. What a life may be yours if you no longer
      waste it!" Harley extricated his hand, and his eye glittered. He made a
      sign that he had more to say, and the applause was hushed. "My Right
      Honourable friend chides me for the years that I have wasted. True; my
      years have been wasted,&mdash;no matter how nor wherefore! But his! how
      have they been spent? In such devotion to the public that those who know
      him not as I do, have said that he had not one feeling left to spare to
      the obscurer duties and more limited affections, by which men of ordinary
      talents and humble minds rivet the links of that social order which it is
      the august destiny of statesmen&mdash;like him who now sits beside me&mdash;to
      cherish and defend. But, for my part, I think that there is no being so
      dangerous as the solemn hypocrite, who, because he drills his cold nature
      into serving mechanically some conventional abstraction,&mdash;whether he
      calls it 'the Constitution' or 'the Public,'&mdash;holds himself dispensed
      from whatever, in the warm blood of private life, wins attachment to
      goodness, and confidence to truth. Let others, then, praise my Right
      Honourable friend as the incorruptible politician. Pardon me if I draw his
      likeness as the loyal sincere man, who might say with the honest priest
      'that he could not tell a lie to gain heaven by it!'&mdash;and with so
      fine a sense of honour, that he would hold it a lie merely to conceal the
      truth." Harley then drew a brilliant picture of the type of chivalrous
      honesty,&mdash;of the ideal which the English attach to the phrase of "a
      perfect gentleman," applying each sentence to his Right Honourable friend
      with an emphasis that seemed to burst from his heart. To all of the
      audience, save two, it was an eulogium which the fervent sincerity of the
      eulogist alone saved from hyperbole. But Levy rubbed his hands, and
      chuckled inly; and Egerton hung his head, and moved restlessly on his
      seat. Every word that Harley uttered lodged an arrow in Audley's breast.
      Amidst the cheers that followed this admirable sketch of the "loyal man,"
      Harley recognized Leonard's enthusiastic voice. He turned sharply towards
      the young man: "Mr. Fairfield cheers this description of integrity, and
      its application; let him imitate the model set before him, and he may live
      to hear praise as genuine as mine from some friend who has tested his
      worth as I have tested Mr. Egerton's. Mr. Fairfield is a poet: his claim
      to that title was disputed by one of the speakers who preceded me!&mdash;unjustly
      disputed! Mr. Fairfield is every inch a poet. But, it has been asked, 'Are
      poets fit for the business of senates? Will they not be writing sonnets to
      Peggy and Moggy, when you want them to concentrate their divine
      imagination on the details of a beer bill?' Do not let Mr. Fairfield's
      friends be alarmed. At the risk of injury to the two candidates whose
      cause I espouse, truth compels me to say, that poets, when they stoop to
      action, are not less prosaic than the dullest amongst us; they are swayed
      by the same selfish interests, they are moved by the same petty passions.
      It is a mistake to suppose that any detail in common life, whether in
      public or private, can be too mean to seduce the exquisite pliances of
      their fancy. Nay, in public life, we may trust them better than other men;
      for vanity is a kind of second conscience, and, as a poet has himself
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "'Who fears not to do ill, yet fears the name,
     And free from conscience, is a slave to shame.'
</pre>
    <p>
      In private life alone we do well to be on our guard against these children
      of fancy, for they so devote to the Muse all their treasury of sentiment,
      that we can no more expect them to waste a thought on the plain duties of
      men, than we can expect the spendthrift, who dazzles the town, 'to fritter
      away his money in paying his debts.' But all the world are agreed to be
      indulgent to the infirmities of those who are their own deceivers and
      their own chastisers. Poets have more enthusiasm, more affection, more
      heart than others; but only for fictions of their own creating. It is in
      vain for us to attach them to ourselves by vulgar merit, by commonplace
      obligations, strive and sacrifice as we may. They are ungrateful to us,
      only because gratitude is so very unpoetical a subject. We lose them the
      moment we attempt to bind. Their love&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "'Light as air, at sight of human ties,
        Spreads its light wings, and in a moment flies.'
</pre>
    <p>
      "They follow their own caprices, adore their own delusions, and, deeming
      the forms of humanity too material for their fantastic affections, conjure
      up a ghost, and are chilled to death by its embrace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly aware that he was passing beyond the comprehension of his
      audience, and touching upon the bounds of his bitter secret (for here he
      was thinking, not of Leonard, but of Nora), Harley gave a new and more
      homely direction to his terrible irony,&mdash;turned into telling ridicule
      the most elevated sentiments Leonard's speech had conveyed, hastened on to
      a rapid view of political questions in general, defended Leslie with the
      same apparent earnestness and latent satire with which he had eulogized
      Audley, and concluded a speech which, for popular effect, had never been
      equalled in that hall, amidst a diapason of cheers that threatened to
      bring down the rafters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more the proceedings were closed, a show of hands taken.
      The show was declared by the Mayor, who was a thorough Blue, in favour of
      the Right Hon. Audley Egerton and Randal Leslie, Esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cries of "No," "Shame," "Partial," etc., a poll demanded on behalf of the
      other two candidates, and the crowd began to pour out of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was the first who vanished, retreating by the private entrance.
      Egerton followed; Randal lingering, Avenel came up and shook hands with
      him openly, but whispered privately, "Meet me to-night in Lansmere Park,
      in the oak copse, about three hundred yards from the turnstile, at the
      town end of the park. We must see how to make all right. What a confounded
      humbug this has been!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the vigour of Harley's address had taken by surprise both friend and
      foe, not one in that assembly&mdash;not even the conscience-stricken
      Egerton&mdash;felt its effect so deeply as the assailed and startled
      Leonard. He was at first perfectly stunned by sarcasms which he so ill
      deserved; nor was it till after the assembly had broken up, that Leonard
      could even conjecture the cause which had provoked the taunt and barbed
      its dart. Evidently Harley had learned (but learned only in order to
      misconceive and to wrong) Leonard's confession of love to Helen Digby. And
      now those implied accusations of disregard to the duties of common life
      not only galled the young man's heart, but outraged his honour. He felt
      the generous indignation of manhood. He must see Lord L'Estrange at once,
      and vindicate himself,&mdash;vindicate Helen; for thus to accuse one was
      tacitly to asperse the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extricating himself from his own enthusiastic partisans, Leonard went
      straight on foot towards Lansmere House. The Park palings touched close
      upon the town, with a shall turnstile for foot passengers. And as Leonard,
      availing himself of this entrance, had advanced some hundred yards or so
      through the park, suddenly, in the midst of that very copse in which
      Avenel had appointed to meet Leslie, he found himself face to face with
      Helen Digby herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen started, with a faint cry. But Leonard, absorbed in his own desire
      to justify both, hailed the sight, and did not pause to account for his
      appearance, nor to soothe her agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Digby!" he exclaimed, throwing into his voice and manner that
      respect which often so cruelly divides the past familiarity from the
      present alienation, "Miss Digby, I rejoice to see you,&mdash;rejoice to
      ask your permission to relieve myself from a charge that in truth wounds
      even you, while levelled but at me. Lord L'Estrange has just implied, in
      public, that I&mdash;I&mdash;who owe him so much, who have honoured him so
      truly, that even the just resentment I now feel half seems to me the
      ingratitude with which he charges me, has implied that&mdash;ah! Miss
      Digby, I can scarcely command words to say what it so humiliates me to
      have heard. But you know how false is all accusation that either of us
      could deceive our common benefactor. Suffer me to repeat to your guardian
      what I presumed to say to you when we last met, what you answered, and
      state how I left your presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Leonard! yes; clear yourself in his eyes. Go! Unjust that he is,
      ungenerous Lord L'Estrange!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Helen Digby!" cried a voice, close at hand. "Of whom do you speak thus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of that voice Helen and Leonard both turned, and beheld
      Violante standing before them, her young beauty rendered almost sublime by
      the noble anger that lit her eyes, glowed in her cheeks, animated her
      stately form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it you who thus speak of Lord L'Estrange? You, Helen Digby,&mdash;you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      From behind Violante now emerged Mr. Dale. "Softly, children," he said;
      and placing one hand on Violante's shoulder, he extended the other to
      Leonard. "What is this? Come hither to me, Leonard, and explain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard walked aside with the parson, and in a few sentences gave vent to
      his swelling heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson shared in Leonard's resentment; and having soon drawn from him
      all that had passed in his memorable interview with Helen, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough! Do not yet seek Lord L'Estrange yourself; I am going to see him,&mdash;I
      am here at his request. His summons, indeed, was for to-morrow; but the
      squire having written me a hurried line, requesting me to meet him at
      Lansmere tomorrow and proceed with him afterwards in search of poor Frank,
      I thought I might have little time for communications with Lord
      L'Estrange, unless I forestalled his invitation and came to-day. Well that
      I did so! I only arrived an hour since, found he was gone to the
      town-hall, and joined the young ladies in the Park. Miss Digby, thinking
      it natural that I might wish to say something in private to my old young
      friend Violante, walked a few paces in advance. Thus, fortunately, I
      chanced to be here, to receive your account, and I trust to remove
      misunderstanding. Lord L'Estrange must now be returned. I will go back to
      the house. You, meanwhile, return to the town, I beseech you. I will come
      to you afterwards at your inn. Your very appearance in these grounds, even
      the brief words that have passed between Helen and you, might only widen
      the breach between yourself and your benefactor. I cannot bear to
      anticipate this. Go back, I entreat you. I will explain all, and Lord
      L'Estrange shall right you! That is,&mdash;that must be his intention!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "IS&mdash;must be his intention&mdash;when he has just so wronged me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," faltered the poor parson, mindful of his promise to L'Estrange
      not to reveal his own interview with that nobleman, and yet not knowing
      otherwise how to explain or to soothe; but still believing Leonard to be
      Harley's son, and remembering all that Harley had so pointedly said of
      atonement, in apparent remorse for crime, Mr. Dale was wholly at a loss
      himself to understand why Harley should have thus prefaced atonement by an
      insult. Anxious, however, to prevent a meeting between Harley and Leonard
      while both were under the influence of such feelings towards each other,
      he made an effort over himself, and so well argued in favour of his own
      diplomacy, that Leonard reluctantly consented to wait for Mr. Dale's
      report.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to reparation or excuse," said he, proudly, "it must rest with Lord
      L'Estrange. I ask it not. Tell him only this,&mdash;that if the instant I
      heard that she whom I loved and held sacred for so many years was
      affianced to him, I resigned even the very wish to call her mine&mdash;if
      that were desertion of man's duties, I am guilty. If to have prayed night
      and day that she who would have blessed my lonely and toilsome life may
      give some charm to his, not bestowed by his wealth and his greatness&mdash;if
      that were ingratitude, I am ungrateful; let him still condemn me. I pass
      out of his sphere,&mdash;a thing that has crossed it a moment, and is
      gone. But Helen he must not blame, suspect; even by a thought. One word
      more. In this election, this strife for objects wholly foreign to all my
      habits, unsuited to my poverty, at war with aspirations so long devoted to
      fairer goals, though by obscurer paths, I obeyed but his will or whim,&mdash;at
      a moment too when my whole soul sickened for repose and solitude. I had
      forced myself at last to take interest in what I had before loathed. But
      in every hope for the future, every stimulant to ambition, Lord
      L'Estrange's esteem still stood before me. Now, what do I here longer? All
      of his conduct, save his contempt for myself, is an enigma. And sinless he
      repeat a wish, which I would fain still regard as a law, I retire from the
      contest he has embittered; I renounce the ambition he has poisoned; and,
      mindful of those humble duties which he implies that I disdain, I return
      to my own home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson nodded assent to each of these sentences; and Leonard, passing
      by Violante and Helen, with a salutation equally distant to both, retraced
      his steps towards the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Violante and Helen had also been in close conference, and that
      conference had suddenly endeared each to the other; for Helen, taken by
      surprise, agitated, overpowered, had revealed to Violante that confession
      of another attachment, which she had made to Lord L'Estrange, the rupture
      of her engagement with the latter. Violante saw that Harley was free.
      Harley, too, had promised to free herself. By a sudden flash of
      conviction, recalling his words, looks, she felt that she was beloved,&mdash;deemed
      that honour alone (while either was yet shackled) had forbidden him to own
      that love. Violante stood a being transformed, "blushing celestial rosy
      red," heaven at her heart, joy in her eyes,&mdash;she loved so well, and
      she trusted so implicitly! Then from out the overflow of her own hope and
      bliss she poured forth such sweet comfort to Helen, that Helen's arm stole
      around her; cheek touched cheek,&mdash;they were as sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another moment, Mr. Dale might have felt some amazement at the sudden
      affection which had sprung up between these young persons; for in his
      previous conversation with Violante, he had, as he thought, very artfully,
      and in a pleasant vein, sounded the young Italian as to her opinion of her
      fair friend's various good qualities, and Violante had rather shrunk from
      the title of "friend;" and though she had the magnanimity to speak with
      great praise of Helen, the praise did not sound cordial. But the good man
      was at this moment occupied in preparing his thoughts for his interview
      with Harley; he joined the two girls in silence, and, linking an arm of
      each within his own, walked slowly towards the house. As he approached the
      terrace he observed Riccabocca and Randal pacing the gravel walk side by
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante, pressing his arm, whispered, "Let us go round the other way; I
      would speak with you a few minutes undisturbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale, supposing that Violante wished to dispense with the presence of
      Helen, said to the latter, "My dear young lady, perhaps you will excuse me
      to Dr. Riccabocca,&mdash;who is beckoning to me, and no doubt very much
      surprised to see me here,&mdash;while I finish what I was saying to
      Violante when we were interrupted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen left them, and Violante led the parson round through the shrubbery,
      towards the side door in another wing of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you to say to me?" asked Mr. Dale, surprised that she remained
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see Lord L'Estrange. Be sure that you convince him of Leonard's
      honour. A doubt of treachery so grieves his noble heart that perhaps it
      may disturb his judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to think very highly of the heart of this Lord L'Estrange,
      child!" said the parson, in some surprise. Violante blushed, but went on
      firmly, and with serious earnestness: "Some words which he-that is, Lord
      L'Estrange&mdash;said to me very lately, make me so glad that you are
      here,&mdash;that you will see him; for I know how good you are, and how
      wise, dear, dear Mr. Dale! He spoke as one who had received some grievous
      wrong, which had abruptly soured all his views of life. He spoke of
      retirement, solitude,&mdash;he on whom his country has so many claims. I
      know not what he can mean, unless it be that his&mdash;his marriage with
      Helen Digby is broken off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Broken off! Is that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it from herself. You may well be astonished that she could even
      think of another after having known him!" The parson fixed his eyes very
      gravely on the young enthusiast. But though her cheek glowed, there was in
      her expression of face so much artless, open innocence, that Mr. Dale
      contented himself with a slight shake of the head, and a dry remark,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it quite natural that Helen Digby should prefer Leonard
      Fairfield. A good girl, not misled by vanity and ambition,&mdash;temptations
      of which it behoves us all to beware; nor least, perhaps, young ladies
      suddenly brought in contact with wealth and rank. As to this nobleman's
      merits, I know not yet whether to allow or to deny them; I reserve my
      judgment till after our interview. This is all you have to say to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante paused a moment. "I cannot think," she said, half smiling,&mdash;"I
      cannot think that the change that has occurred in him,&mdash;for changed
      he is,&mdash;that his obscure hints as to injury received, and justice to
      be done, are caused merely by his disappointment with regard to Helen. But
      you can learn that; learn if he be so very much disappointed. Nay, I think
      not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her slight hand from the parson's arm, and darted away through
      the evergreens. Half concealed amidst the laurels, she turned back, and
      Mr. Dale caught her eye, half arch, half melancholy; its light came soft
      through a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't half like this," muttered the parson; "I shall give Dr.
      Riccabocca a caution." So muttering, he pushed open the side door, and
      finding a servant, begged admittance to Lord L'Estrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley at that moment was closeted with Levy, and his countenance was
      composed and fearfully stern. "So, so, by this time to-morrow," said he,
      "Mr. Egerton will be tricked out of his election by Mr. Randal Leslie!
      good! By this time to-morrow his ambition will be blasted by the treachery
      of his friends! good! By this time to-morrow the bailiffs will seize his
      person,&mdash;ruined, beggared, pauper, and captive,&mdash;all because he
      has trusted and been deceived! good! And if he blame you, prudent Baron
      Levy, if he accuse smooth Mr. Randal Leslie, forget not to say, 'We were
      both but the blind agents of your friend Harley L'Estrange. Ask him why
      you are so miserable a dupe.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And might I now ask your Lordship for one word of explanation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir!&mdash;it is enough that I have spared you. But you were never my
      friend; I have no revenge against a man whose hand I never even touched."
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron scowled, but there was a power about his tyrant that cowed him
      into actual terror. He resumed, after a pause, "And though Mr. Leslie is
      to be member for Lansmere,&mdash;thanks to you,&mdash;you still desire
      that I should&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do exactly as I have said. My plans now never vary a hair's breadth."
    </p>
    <p>
      The groom of the chambers entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, the Reverend Mr. Dale wishes to know if you can receive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Dale! he should have come to-morrow. Say that I did not expect him
      to-day; that I am unfortunately engaged till dinner, which will be earlier
      than usual. Show him into his room; he will have but little time to change
      his dress. By the way, Mr. Egerton dines in his own apartment."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The leading members of the Blue Committee were invited to dine at the
      Park, and the hour for the entertainment was indeed early, as there might
      be much need yet of active exertion on the eve of a poll in a contest
      expected to be so close, and in which the inflexible Hundred and Fifty
      "Waiters upon Providence" still reserved their very valuable votes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party was gay and animated, despite the absence of Audley Egerton,
      who, on the plea of increased indisposition, had shut himself up in his
      rooms the instant that he had returned from the town-hall, and sent word
      to Harley that he was too unwell to join the party at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal was really in high spirits, despite the very equivocal success of
      his speech. What did it signify if a speech failed, provided the election
      was secure? He was longing for the appointment with Dick Avenel which was
      to make "all right!" The squire was to bring the money for the purchase of
      the coveted lands the next morning. Riccabocca had assured him, again and
      again, of Violante's hand. If ever Randal Leslie could be called a happy
      man, it was as he sat at that dinner taking wine with Mr. Mayor and Mr.
      Alderman, and looking, across the gleaming silver plateau, down the long
      vista into wealth and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was scarcely over, when Lord L'Estrauge, in a brief speech,
      reminded his guests of the work still before them; and after a toast to
      the health of the future members for Lansmere, dismissed the Committee to
      their labours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy made a sign to Randal, who followed the baron to his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leslie, your election is in some jeopardy. I find, from the conversation
      of those near me at dinner, that Egerton has made such way amongst the
      Blues by his speech, and they are so afraid of losing a man who does them
      so much credit, that the Committee men not only talk of withholding from
      you their second votes and of plumping Egerton, but of subscribing
      privately amongst themselves to win over that coy body of a Hundred and
      Fifty, upon whom I know that Avenel counts in whatever votes he may be
      able to transfer to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be very unhandsome in the Committee, which pretends to act for
      both of us, to plump Egerton," said Randal, with consistent anger; "but I
      don't think they can get those Hundred and Fifty without the most open and
      exortant bribery,&mdash;an expense which Egerton will not pay, and which
      it would be very discreditable to Lord L'Estrange or his father to
      countenance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told them flatly," returned Levy, "that, as Mr. Egerton's agent, I
      would allow no proceedings that might vitiate the election, but that I
      would undertake the management of these men myself; and I am going into
      the town in order to do so. I have also persuaded the leading Committee
      men to reconsider their determination to plump Egerton; they have decided
      to do as L'Estrange directs, and I know what he will say. You may rely on
      me," continued the baron, who spoke with a dogged seriousness, unusual to
      his cynical temper, "to obtain for you the preference over Audley, if it
      be in my power to do so. Meanwhile, you should really see Avenel this very
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have an appointment with him at ten o'clock; and judging by his speech
      against Egerton, I cannot doubt on his aid to me, if convinced by his
      poll-books that he is not able to return both himself and his impertinent
      nephew. My speech, however sarcastically treated by Mr. Fairfield, must at
      least have disposed the Yellow party to vote rather for me than for a
      determined opponent like Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so; for your speech and Fairfield's answer have damaged you
      terribly with the Blues. However, your main hope rests on my power to keep
      those Hundred and Fifty rascals from splitting their votes on Egerton, and
      to induce them, by all means short of bringing myself before a Committee
      of the House of Commons for positive bribery,&mdash;which would hurt most
      seriously my present social position,&mdash;to give one vote to you. I
      shall tell them, as I have told the Committee, that Egerton is safe, and
      will pay nothing; but that you want the votes, and that I&mdash;in short,
      if they can be bought upon tick, I will buy them. Avenel, however, can
      serve you best here; for as they are all Yellows at heart, they make no
      scruple of hinting that they want twice as much for voting Blue as they
      will take for voting Yellow. And Avenel being a townsman, and knowing
      their ways, could contrive to gain them, and yet not bribe."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (shaking his head incredulously).&mdash;"Not bribe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVY.&mdash;"Pooh! Not bribe so as to be found out." There was a knock at
      the door. A servant entered and presented Mr. Egerton's compliments to
      Baron Levy, with a request that the baron would immediately come to his
      rooms for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Levy, when the servant had withdrawn, "I must go to Egerton,
      and the instant I leave him I shall repair to the town. Perhaps I may pass
      the night there." So saying, he left Randal, and took his way to Audley's
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Levy," said the statesman, abruptly, upon the entrance of the baron,
      "have you betrayed my secret&mdash;my first marriage&mdash;to Lord
      L'Estrange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Egerton; on my honour, I have not betrayed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard his speech! Did you not detect a fearful irony under his
      praises, or is it but&mdash;but-my conscience?" added the proud man,
      through his set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really," said Levy, "Lord L'Estrange seemed to me to select for his
      praise precisely those points in your character which any other of your
      friends would select for panegyric."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, any other of my friends!&mdash;What friends?" muttered Egerton,
      gloomily. Then, rousing himself, he added, in a voice that had none of its
      accustomed clear firmness of tone, "Your presence here in this house,
      Levy, surprised me, as I told you at the first; I could not conceive its
      necessity. Harley urged you to come,&mdash;he with whom you are no
      favourite! You and he both said that your acquaintance with Richard Avenel
      would enable you to conciliate his opposition. I cannot congratulate you
      on your success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My success remains to be proved. The vehemence of his attack may be but a
      feint to cover his alliance to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley went on without notice of the interruption. "There is a change in
      Harley,&mdash;to me and to all; a change, perhaps, not perceptible to
      others&mdash;but I have known him from a boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is occupied for the first time with the practical business of life.
      That would account for a much greater change than you remark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you see him familiarly, converse with him often?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, and only on matters connected with the election. Occasionally,
      indeed, he consults me as to Randal Leslie, in whom, as your special
      protege, he takes considerable interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, too, surprises me. Well, I am weary of perplexing myself. This
      place is hateful; after to-morrow I shall leave it, and breathe in peace.
      You have seen the reports of the canvass; I have had no heart to inspect
      them. Is the election as safe as they say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Avenel withdraws his nephew, and the votes thus released split off to
      you, you are secure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think his nephew will be withdrawn? Poor young man! defeat at his
      age, and with such talents, is hard to bear." Audley sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must leave you now, if you have nothing important to say," said the
      baron, rising. "I have much to do, as the election is yet to be won, and&mdash;to
      you the loss of it would be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ruin, I know. Well, Levy, it is, on the whole, to your advantage that I
      should not lose. There may be more to get from me yet. And, judging by the
      letters I received this morning, my position is rendered so safe by the
      absolute necessity of my party to keep me up, that the news of my
      pecuniary difficulties will not affect me so much as I once feared. Never
      was my career so free from obstacle, so clear towards the highest summit
      of ambition; never, in my day of ostentatious magnificence, as it is now,
      when I am prepared to shrink into a lodging, with a single servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to hear it; and I am the more anxious to secure your election,
      upon which this career must depend, because&mdash;nay, I hardly like to
      tell you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been obliged, by a sudden rush on all my resources, to consign
      some of your bills and promissory notes to another, who, if your person
      should not be protected from arrest by parliamentary privilege, might be
      harsh and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Traitor!" interrupted Egerton, fiercely, all the composed contempt with
      which he usually treated the usurer giving way, "say no more. How could I
      ever expect otherwise! You have foreseen my defeat, and have planned my
      destruction. Presume no reply! Sir, begone from my presence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find that you have worse friends than myself," said the baron,
      moving to the door; "and if you are defeated, if your prospects for life
      are destroyed, I am the last man you will think of blaming. But I forgive
      your anger, and trust that to-morrow you will receive those explanations
      of my conduct which you are now in no temper to bear. I go to take care of
      the election."
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Audley's sudden passion seemed to forsake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered together, in that prompt and logical precision which the habit
      of transacting public business bestows, all his thoughts, and sounded all
      his fears; and most vivid of every thought, and most intolerable of every
      fear, was the belief that the baron had betrayed him to L'Estrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot bear this suspense," he cried aloud and abruptly. "I will see
      Harley myself. Open as he is, the very sound of his voice will tell me at
      once if I am a bankrupt even of human friendship. If that friendship be
      secure, if Harley yet clasp my hand with the same cordial warmth, all
      other loss shall not wring from my fortitude one complaint."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell; his valet, who was waiting in the anteroom, appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and see if Lord L'Estrange is engaged. I would speak with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant came back in less than two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I find that my Lord is now particularly engaged, since he has given
      strict orders that he is not to be disturbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Engaged! on what, whom with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is in his own room, sir, with a clergyman, who arrived, and dined
      here, to-day. I am told that he was formerly curate of Lansmere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lansmere! curate! His name, his name! Not Dale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, that is the name,&mdash;the Reverend Mr. Dale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me," said Audley, in a faint voice. "Dale! the man who suspected
      Harley, who called on me in London, spoke of a child,&mdash;my child,&mdash;and
      sent me to find but another grave! He closeted with Harley,&mdash;he!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley sank back on his chair, and literally gasped for breath. Few men in
      the world had a more established reputation for the courage that dignifies
      manhood, whether the physical courage or the moral. But at that moment it
      was not grief, not remorse, that paralyzed Audley,&mdash;it was fear. The
      brave man saw before him, as a thing visible and menacing, the aspect of
      his own treachery,&mdash;that crime of a coward; and into cowardice he was
      stricken. What had he to dread? Nothing save the accusing face of an
      injured friend,&mdash;nothing but that. And what more terrible? The only
      being, amidst all his pomp of partisans, who survived to love him, the
      only being for whom the cold statesman felt the happy, living, human
      tenderness of private affection, lost to him forever! He covered his face
      with both hands, and sat in suspense of something awful, as a child sits
      in the dark, the drops on his brow, and his frame trembling.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Harley had listened to Mr. Dale's vindication of Leonard with
      cold attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," said he, at the close. "Mr. Fairfield (for so we will yet call
      him) shall see me to-night; and if apology be due to him, I will make it.
      At the same time, it shall be decided whether he continue this contest or
      retire. And now, Mr. Dale, it was not to hear how this young man wooed, or
      shrunk from wooing, my affianced bride, that I availed myself of your
      promise to visit me at this house. We agreed that the seducer of Nora
      Avenel deserved chastisement, and I promised that Nora Avenel's son should
      find a father. Both these assurances shall be fulfilled to-morrow. And
      you, sir," continued Harley, rising, his whole form gradually enlarged by
      the dignity of passion, "who wear the garb appropriated to the holiest
      office of Christian charity; you who have presumed to think that, before
      the beard had darkened my cheek, I could first betray the girl who had
      been reared under this roof, then abandon her,&mdash;sneak like a dastard
      from the place in which my victim came to die, leave my own son, by the
      woman thus wronged, without thought or care, through the perilous years of
      tempted youth, till I found him, by chance, an outcast in a desert more
      dread than Hagar's,&mdash;you, sir, who have for long years thus judged of
      me, shall have the occasion to direct your holy anger towards the rightful
      head; and in me, you who have condemned the culprit shall respect the
      judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale was at first startled, and almost awed, by this unexpected burst.
      But, accustomed to deal with the sternest and the darkest passions, his
      calm sense and his habit of authority over those whose souls were bared to
      him, nobly recovered from their surprise. "My Lord," said he, "first, with
      humility I bow to your rebuke, and entreat your pardon for my erring, and,
      as you say, my uncharitable opinions. We dwellers in a village and obscure
      pastors of a humble flock, we, mercifully removed from temptation, are too
      apt, perhaps, to exaggerate its power over those whose lots are cast in
      that great world which has so many gates ever open to evil. This is my
      sole excuse if I was misled by what appeared to me strong circumstantial
      evidence. But forgive me again if I warn you not to fall into an error
      perhaps little lighter than my own. Your passion, when you cleared
      yourself from reproach, became you. But ah, my Lord, when with that stern
      brow and those flashing eyes, you launched your menace upon another over
      whom you would constitute yourself the judge, forgetful of the divine
      precept, 'Judge not,' I felt that I was listening no longer to honest
      self-vindication,&mdash;I felt that I was listening to fierce revenge!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call it revenge, or what you will," said Harley, with sullen firmness;
      "but I have been stung too deeply not to sting. Frank with all, till the
      last few days, I have ever been. Frank to you, at least, even now, this
      much I tell you: I pretend to no virtue in what I still hold to be
      justice; but no declamations nor homilies tending to prove that justice is
      sinful will move my resolves. As man I have been outraged, and as man I
      will retaliate. The way and the mode, the true criminal and his fitting
      sentence, you will soon learn, sir. I have much to do to-night; forgive me
      if I adjourn for the present all further conference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; do not dismiss me. There is something, in spite of your present
      language, which so commands my interest; I see that there has been so much
      suffering where there is now so much wrath,&mdash;that I would save you
      from the suffering worse than all,&mdash;remorse. Oh, pause, my dear Lord,
      pause and answer me but two questions; then I will leave your after course
      to yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say on, sir," said Lord L'Estrange, touched, and with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First; then, analyze your own feelings. Is this anger merely to punish an
      offender and to right the living,&mdash;for who can pretend to right the
      dead? Or is there not some private hate that stirs and animates and
      confuses all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley remained silent. Mr. Dale renewed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You loved this poor girl. Your language even now reveals it. You speak of
      treachery: perhaps you had a rival who deceived you; I know not, guess
      not, whom. But if you would strike the rival, must you not wound the
      innocent son? And, in presenting Nora's child to his father, as you pledge
      yourself to do, can you mean some cruel mockery that, under seeming
      kindness, implies some unnatural vengeance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You read well the heart of man," said Harley; "and I have owned to you
      that I am but man. Pass on; you have another question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And one more solemn and important. In my world of a village, revenge is a
      common passion; it is the sin of the uninstructed. The savage deems it
      noble! but Christ's religion, which is the sublime Civilizer, emphatically
      condemns it. Why? Because religion ever seeks to ennoble a man; and
      nothing so debases him as revenge. Look into your own heart, and tell me
      whether, since you have cherished this passion, you have not felt all
      sense of right and wrong confused,&mdash;have not felt that whatever would
      before have seemed to you mean and base, appears now but just means to
      your heated end. Revenge is ever a hypocrite: rage, at least, strikes with
      the naked sword; but revenge, stealthy and patient, conceals the weapon of
      the assassin. My Lord, your colour changes. What is your answer to my
      question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," exclaimed Harley, with a voice thrilling in its mournful anguish,
      "it is not since I have cherished the revenge that I am changed, that
      right and wrong grow dark to me, that hypocrisy seems the atmosphere fit
      for earth. No; it is since the discovery that demands the vengeance. It is
      useless, sir," he continued impetuously,&mdash;"useless to argue with me.
      Were I to sit down, patient and impotent, under the sense of the wrong
      which I have received, I should feel, indeed, that debasement which you
      ascribe to the gratification of what you term revenge. I should never
      regain the self-esteem which the sentiment of power now restores to me; I
      should feel as if the whole world could perceive and jeer at my meek
      humiliation. I know not why I have said so much,&mdash;why I have betrayed
      to you so much of my secret mind, and stooped to vindicate my purpose. I
      never meant it. Again I say, we must close this conference." Harley here
      walked to the door, and opened it significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word more, Lord L'Estrange,&mdash;but one. You will not hear me. I am
      a comparative stranger, but you have a friend, a friend dear and intimate,
      now under the same roof. Will you consent, at least, to take counsel of
      Mr. Audley Egerton? None can doubt his friendship for you; none can doubt
      that whatever he advise will be that which best becomes your honour. What,
      my Lord, you hesitate,&mdash;you feel ashamed to confide to your dearest
      friend a purpose which his mind would condemn? Then I will seek him, I
      will implore him to save you from what can but entail repentance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Dale, I must forbid you to see Mr. Egerton. What has passed between
      us ought to be as sacred to you as a priest of Rome holds confession. This
      much, however, I will say to content you: I promise that I will do nothing
      that shall render me unworthy of Mr. Audley Egerton's friendship, or which
      his fine sense of honour shall justify him in blaming. Let that satisfy
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my Lord," cried Mr. Dale, pausing irresolute at the doorway, and
      seizing Harley's hand, "I should indeed be satisfied if you would submit
      yourself to higher counsel than mine,&mdash;than Mr. Egerton's, than
      man's. Have you never felt the efficacy of prayer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My life has been wasted," replied Harley, "and I dare not, therefore,
      boast that I have found prayer efficacious. But, so far back as I can
      remember, it has at least been my habit to pray to Heaven, night and
      morning, until at least&mdash;until&mdash;" The natural and obstinate
      candour of the man forced out the last words, which implied reservation.
      He stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Until you have cherished revenge? You have not dared to pray since? Oh,
      reflect what evil there is within us, when we dare not come before Heaven,&mdash;dare
      not pray for what we wish. You are moved. I leave you to your own
      thoughts." Harley inclined his head, and the parson passed him by, and
      left him alone,&mdash;startled indeed; but was he softened? As Mr. Dale
      hurried along the corridor, much agitated, Violante stole from a recess
      formed by a large bay window, and linking her arm in his, said anxiously,
      but timidly: "I have been waiting for you, dear Mr. Dale; and so long! You
      have been with Lord L'Estrange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you not speak? You have left him comforted, happier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happier! No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said Violante, with a look of surprise, and a sadness not unmixed
      with petulance in her quick tone. "What! does he then so grieve that Helen
      prefers another?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the grave emotions that disturbed his mind, Mr. Dale was struck by
      Violante's question, and the voice in which it was said. He loved her
      tenderly. "Child, child," said he, "I am glad that Helen has escaped Lord
      L'Estrange. Beware, oh, beware how he excite any gentler interest in
      yourself. He is a dangerous man,&mdash;more dangerous for glimpses of a
      fine original nature. He may well move the heart of the innocent and
      inexperienced, for he has strangely crept into mine. But his heart is
      swollen with pride and ire and malice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake; it is false!" cried Violante, impetuously. "I cannot believe
      one word that would asperse him who has saved my father from a prison, or
      from death. You have not treated him gently. He fancies he has been
      wronged by Leonard, received ingratitude from Helen. He has felt the sting
      in proportion to his own susceptible and generous heart, and you have
      chided where you should have soothed. Poor Lord L'Estrange! And you have
      left him still indignant and unhappy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foolish girl! I have left him meditating sin; I have left him afraid to
      pray; I have left him on the brink of some design&mdash;I know not what&mdash;but
      which involves more than Leonard in projects of revenge; I have left him
      so, that if his heart be really susceptible and generous, he will wake
      from wrath to be the victim of long and unavailing remorse. If your father
      has influence over him, tell Dr. Riccabocca what I say, and bid him seek,
      and in his turn save, the man who saved himself. He has not listened to
      religion,&mdash;he maybe more docile to philosophy. I cannot stay here
      longer,&mdash;I must go to Leonard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale broke from Violante and hurried down the corridor; Violante stood
      on the same spot, stunned and breathless. Harley on the brink of some
      strange sin! Harley to wake, the victim of remorse! Harley to be saved, as
      he had saved her father! Her breast heaved, her colour went and came, her
      eyes were raised, her lips murmured. She advanced with soft footsteps up
      the corridor; she saw the lights gleaming from Harley's room, and suddenly
      they were darkened, as the inmate of the room shut to the door, with angry
      and impatient hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      An outward act often betrays the inward mind. As Harley had thus closed
      the door, so had he sought to shut his heart from the intrusion of softer
      and holier thoughts. He had turned to his hearthstone, and stood on it,
      resolved and hardened. The man who had loved with such pertinacious
      fidelity far so many years could not at once part with hate. A passion
      once admitted to his breast, clung to it with such rooted force! But woe,
      woe to thee, Harley L'Estrange, if tomorrow at this hour thou stand at the
      hearthstone, thy designs accomplished, knowing that, in the fulfilment of
      thy blind will, thou hast met falsehood with falsehood, and deception with
      deceit! What though those designs now seem so consummate, so just, so
      appropriate, so exquisite a revenge,&mdash;seem to thee the sole revenge
      wit can plan and civilized life allow: wilt thou ever wash from thy memory
      the stain that will sully thine honour? Thou, too, professing friendship
      still, and masking perfidy under smiles! Grant that the wrong be great as
      thou deem it,&mdash;be ten times greater: the sense of thy meanness, O
      gentleman and soldier, will bring the blush to thy cheek in the depth of
      thy solitude. Thou, who now thinkest others unworthy a trustful love, wilt
      feel thyself forever unworthy theirs. Thy seclusion will know not repose.
      The dignity of man will forsake thee. Thy proud eye will quail from the
      gaze. Thy step will no longer spurn the earth that it treads on. He who
      has once done a base thing is never again wholly reconciled to honour. And
      woe&mdash;thrice woe, if thou learn too late that thou hast exaggerated
      thy fancied wrong: that there is excuse, where thou seest none; that thy
      friend may have erred, but that his error is venial compared to thy
      fancied retribution!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, however, in the superb elation of conscious power, though lavished
      on a miserable object,&mdash;a terrible example of what changes one evil
      and hateful thought, cherished to the exclusion of all others, can make in
      the noblest nature, stood, on the hearth of his fathers, and on the abyss
      of a sorrow and a shame from which there could be no recall, the
      determined and scornful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand is on the door,&mdash;he does not hear it; a form passes the
      threshold,-he does not see it; a light step pauses, a soft eye gazes. Deaf
      and blind still to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante came on, gathering courage, and stood at the hearth by his side.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "LORD L'ESTRANGE, noble friend!"
    </h3>
    <p>
      "You!&mdash;and here&mdash;Violante? Is it I whom you seek? For what? Good
      heavens! what has happened? Why are you so pale; why tremble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you forgiven Helen?" asked Violante, beginning with evasive
      question, and her cheek was pale no more. "Helen, the poor child! I have
      nothing in her to forgive, much to thank her for. She has been frank and
      honest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Leonard&mdash;whom I remember in my childhood&mdash;you have forgiven
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair mediator," said Harley, smiling, though coldly, "happy is the man
      who deceives another; all plead for him. And if the man deceived cannot
      forgive, no one will sympathize or excuse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Leonard did not deceive you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, from the first. It is a long tale, and not to be told to you; but I
      cannot forgive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu! my Lord. Helen must, then, still be very dear to you!" Violante
      turned away. Her emotion was so artless, her very anger so charming, that
      the love, against which, in the prevalence of his later and darker
      passions, he had so sternly struggled, rushed back upon Harley's breast;
      but it came only in storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, but talk not of Helen!" he exclaimed. "Ah, if Leonard's sole
      offence had been what you appear to deem it, do you think I could feel
      resentment? No; I should have gratefully hailed the hand that severed a
      rash and ungenial tie. I would have given my ward to her lover with such a
      dower as it suits my wealth to bestow. But his offence dates from his very
      birth. To bless and to enrich the son of a man who&mdash;Violante, listen
      to me. We may soon part, and forever. Others may misconstrue my actions;
      you, at least, shall know from what just principle they spring. There was
      a man whom I singled out of the world as more than a brother. In the
      romance of my boyhood I saw one who dazzled my fancy, captivated my heart.
      It was a dream of Beauty breathed into waking life. I loved,&mdash;I
      believed myself beloved. I confided all my heart to this friend,&mdash;this
      more than brother; he undertook to befriend and to aid my suit. On that
      very pretext he first saw this ill-fated girl, saw, betrayed, destroyed
      her; left me ignorant that her love, which I had thought mine, had been
      lavished so wildly on another; left me to believe that my own suit she had
      fled, but in generous self-sacrifice,&mdash;for she was poor and humbly
      born; that&mdash;oh, vain idiot that I was!&mdash;the self-sacrifice had
      been too strong for a young human heart, which had broken in the struggle;
      left me to corrode my spring of life in remorse; clasped my hand in
      mocking comfort, smiled at my tears of agony&mdash;not one tear himself
      for his own poor victim! And suddenly, not long since, I learned all this.
      And in the father of Leonard Fairfield, you behold the man who has
      poisoned all the well-spring of joy to me. You weep! Oh, Violante! the
      Past he has blighted and embittered,&mdash;that I could forgive; but the
      Future is blasted too. For just ere this treason was revealed to me, I had
      begun to awake from the torpor of my dreary penance, to look with
      fortitude towards the duties I had slighted, to own that the pilgrimage
      before me was not barren. And then, oh then, I felt that all love was not
      buried in a grave. I felt that you, had fate so granted, might have been
      all to my manhood which youth only saw through the delusion of its golden
      mists. True, I was then bound to Helen; true, that honour to her might
      forbid me all hope. But still, even to know that my heart was not all
      ashes, that I could love again, that that glorious power and privilege of
      our being was still mine, seemed to me so heavenly sweet. But then this
      revelation of falsehood burst on me, and all truth seemed blotted from the
      universe. I am freed from Helen; ah, freed, forsooth,&mdash;because not
      even rank and wealth, and benefits and confiding tenderness, could bind to
      me one human heart! Free from her; but between me and your fresh nature
      stands Suspicion as an Upas tree. Not a hope that would pass through the
      tainted air and fly to you, but falls dead under the dismal boughs. I
      love!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha! I&mdash;I, whom the past has taught the impossibility to be loved
      again. No: if those soft lips murmured 'Yes' to the burning prayer that,
      had I been free but two short weeks ago, would have rushed from the frank
      deeps of my heart, I should but imagine that you deceived yourself,&mdash;a
      girl's first fleeting delusive fancy,&mdash;nothing more! Were you my
      bride, Violante, I should but debase your bright nature by my own curse of
      distrust. At each word of tenderness, my heart would say, 'How long will
      this last; when will the deception come?' Your beauty, your gifts, would
      bring me but jealous terror, eternally I should fly from the Present to
      the Future, and say. 'These hairs will be gray, while flattering youth
      will surround her in the zenith of her charms.' Why then do I hate and
      curse my foe? Why do I resolve upon revenge? I comprehend it now. I knew
      that there was something more imperious than the ghost of the Past that
      urged me on. Gazing on you, I feel that it was the dim sense of a mighty
      and priceless loss; it is not the dead Nora,&mdash;it is the living
      Violante. Look not at me with those reproachful eyes: they cannot reverse
      my purpose; they cannot banish suspicion from my sickened soul; they
      cannot create a sunshine in the midst of this ghastly twilight. Go, go;
      leave me to the sole joy that bequeaths no disappointment, the sole
      feeling that unites me to social man; leave me to my revenge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revenge! Oh, cruel!" exclaimed Violante, laying her hand on his arm. "And
      in revenge, it is your own life that you will risk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My life, simple child! This is no contest of life against life. Could I
      bare to all the world my wrongs for their ribald laughter, I should only
      give to my foe the triumph to pity my frenzy, to shun the contest; or
      grant it, if I could find a second&mdash;and then fire in the air. And all
      the world would say, 'Generous Egerton! soul of honour!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egerton, Mr. Egerton! He cannot be this foe? It is not on him you can
      design revenge,&mdash;you who spend all your hours in serving his cause,
      you to whom he trusts so fondly, you who leaned yesterday on his shoulder,
      and smiled so cheeringly in his face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I? Hypocrisy against hypocrisy, snare against snare: that is my
      revenge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley, Harley! Cease, cease!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm of passion rushed on unheeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seem to promote his ambition but to crush it into the mire. I have
      delivered him from the gentler gripe of an usurer, so that he shall hold
      at my option alms or a prison&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend, friend! Hush, hush!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have made the youth he has reared and fostered into treachery like his
      own (your father's precious choice, Randal Leslie) mine instrument in the
      galling lesson how ingratitude can sting. His very son shall avenge the
      mother, and be led to his father's breast as victor, with Randal Leslie,
      in the contest that deprives sire and benefactor of all that makes life
      dear to ambitious egotism. And if, in the breast of Audley Egerton, there
      can yet lurk one memory of what I was to him and to truth, not his least
      punishment will be the sense that his own perfidy has so changed the man
      whose very scorn of falsehood has taught him to find in fraud itself the
      power of retribution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this be not a terrible dream," murmured Violante, recoiling, "it is
      not your foe alone that you will deprive of all that makes life dear. Act
      thus&mdash;and what, in the future, is left to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you? Oh, never fear. I may give Randal Leslie a triumph over his
      patron, but in the same hour I will unmask his villany, and sweep him
      forever from your path. What in the future is left to you?&mdash;your
      birthright and your native land; hope, joy, love, felicity. Could it be
      possible that in the soft but sunny fancy which plays round the heart of
      maiden youth, but still sends no warmth into its deeps,&mdash;could it be
      possible that you had Honoured me with a gentler thought, it will pass
      away, and you will be the pride and delight of one of your own years, to
      whom the vista of Time is haunted by no chilling spectres, one who can
      look upon that lovely face, and not turn away to mutter, 'Too fair, too
      fair for me!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, agony!" exclaimed Violante, with sudden passion. "In my turn hear me.
      If, as you promise, I am released from the dreadful thought that he, at
      whose touch I shudder, can claim this hand, my choice is irrevocably made.
      The altars which await me will not be those of a human love. But oh, I
      implore you&mdash;by all the memories of your own life, hitherto, if
      sorrowful, unsullied, by the generous interest you yet profess for me,
      whom you will have twice saved from a danger to which death were mercy&mdash;leave,
      oh, leave to me the right to regard your image as I have done from the
      first dawn of childhood. Leave me the right to honour and revere it. Let
      not an act accompanied with a meanness&mdash;oh that I should say the
      word!&mdash;a meanness and a cruelty that give the lie to your whole life&mdash;make
      even a grateful remembrance of you an unworthy sin. When I kneel within
      the walls that divide me from the world, oh, let me think that I can pray
      for you as the noblest being that the world contains! Hear me! hear me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Violante!" murmured Harley, his whole frame heaving with emotion, "bear
      with me. Do not ask of me the sacrifice of what seems to me the cause of
      manhood itself,&mdash;to sit down, meek and patient, under a wrong that
      debases me, with the consciousness that all my life I have been the
      miserable dupe to affections I deemed so honest, to regrets that I
      believed so holy. Ah, I should feel more mean in my pardon than you can
      think me in revenge! Were it an acknowledged enemy, I could open my arms
      to him at your bidding; but the perfidious friend!&mdash;ask it not. My
      cheek burns at the thought, as at the stain of a blow. Give me but
      to-morrow&mdash;one day&mdash;I demand no more&mdash;wholly to myself and
      to the past, and mould me for the future as you will. Pardon, pardon the
      ungenerous thoughts that extended distrust to you. I retract them; they
      are gone,&mdash;dispelled before those touching words, those ingenuous
      eyes. At your feet, Violante, I repent and I implore! Your father himself
      shall banish your sordid suitor. Before this hour to-morrow you will be
      free. Oh, then, then! will you not give me this hand to guide me again
      into the paradise of my youth? Violante, it is in vain to wrestle with
      myself, to doubt, to reason, to be wisely fearful! I love, I love you! I
      trust again in virtue and faith. I place my fate in your keeping." If at
      times Violante may appear to have ventured beyond the limit of strict
      maiden bashfulness, much may be ascribed to her habitual candour, her
      solitary rearing, and remoteness from the world, the very innocence of her
      soul, and the warmth of heart which Italy gives its daughters. But now
      that sublimity of thought and purpose which pervaded her nature, and
      required only circumstances to develop, made her superior to all the
      promptings of love itself. Dreams realized which she had scarcely dared to
      own; Harley free, Harley at her feet; all the woman struggling at her
      heart, mantling in her blushes, still stronger than love, stronger than
      the joy of being loved again, was the heroic will,&mdash;will to save him,
      who in all else ruled her existence, from the eternal degradation to which
      passion had blinded his own confused and warring spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving one hand in his impassioned clasp, as he still knelt before her,
      she raised on high the other. "Ah," she said, scarce audibly,&mdash;"ah,
      if heaven vouchsafe me the proud and blissful privilege to be allied to
      your fate, to minister to your happiness, never should I know one fear of
      your distrust. No time, no change, no sorrow&mdash;not even the loss of
      your affection&mdash;could make me forfeit the right to remember that you
      had once confided to me a heart so noble. But"&mdash;here her voice rose
      in its tone, and the glow fled from her cheek&mdash;"but, O Thou the Ever
      Present, hear and receive the solemn vow. If to me he refuse to sacrifice
      the sin that would debase him, that sin be the barrier between us
      evermore; and may my life, devoted to Thy service, atone for the hour in
      which he belied the nature he received from Thee! Harley, release me! I
      have spoken: firm as yourself, I leave the choice to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You judge me harshly," said Harley, rising, with sullen anger; "but at
      least I have not the meanness to sell what I hold as justice, though the
      bribe may include my last hope of happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meanness! Oh, unhappy, beloved Harley!" exclaimed Violante, with such a
      gush of exquisite reproachful tenderness, that it thrilled him as the
      voice of the parting guardian angel. "Meanness! But it is that from which
      I implore you to save yourself. You cannot judge, you cannot see. You are
      dark, dark. Lost Christian that you are, what worse than heathen darkness
      to feign the friendship the better to betray; to punish falsehood by
      becoming yourself so false; to accept the confidence even of your
      bitterest foe, and then to sink below his own level in deceit? And oh,
      worse than all&mdash;to threaten that a son&mdash;son of the woman you
      professed to love&mdash;should swell your vengeance against a father! No!
      it was not you that said this,&mdash;it was the Fiend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough!" exclaimed Harley, startled, conscience-stricken, and rushing
      into resentment, in order to escape the sense of shame. "Enough! you
      insult the man you professed to honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I honoured the prototype of gentleness and valour. I honoured one who
      seemed to me to clothe with life every grand and generous image that is
      born from the souls of poets. Destroy that ideal, and you destroy the
      Harley whom I honoured. He is dead to me forever. I will mourn for him as
      his widow, faithful to his memory, weeping over the thought of what he
      was." Sobs choked her voice; but as Harley, once more melted, sprang
      forward to regain her side, she escaped with a yet quicker movement,
      gained the door, and darting down the corridor, vanished from his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley stood still one moment, thoroughly irresolute, nay, almost subdued.
      Then sternness, though less rigid than before, gradually came to his brow.
      The demon had still its hold in the stubborn and marvellous pertinacity
      with which the man clung to all that once struck root at his heart. With a
      sudden impulse that still withheld decision, yet spoke of sore-shaken
      purpose, he strode to his desk, drew from it Nora's manuscript, and passed
      from his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley had meant never to have revealed to Audley the secret he had gained
      until the moment when revenge was consummated. He had contemplated no vain
      reproach. His wrath would have spoken forth in deeds, and then a word
      would have sufficed as the key to all. Willing, perhaps, to hail some
      extenuation of perfidy, though the possibility of such extenuation he had
      never before admitted, he determined on the interview which he had
      hitherto so obstinately shunned, and went straight to the room in which
      Audley Egerton still sat, solitary and fearful.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Egerton heard the well-known step advancing near and nearer up the
      corridor, heard the door open and reclose; and he felt, by one of those
      strange and unaccountable instincts which we call forebodings, that the
      hour he had dreaded for so many secret years had come at last. He nerved
      his courage, withdrew his hands from his face, and rose in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      No less silent, Harley stood before him. The two men gazed on each other;
      you might have heard their breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen Mr. Dale?" said Egerton, at length. "You know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All!" said Harley, completing the arrested sentence. Audley drew a long
      sigh. "Be it so; but no, Harley, you deceive yourself; you cannot know
      all, from any one living, save myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My knowledge comes from the dead," answered Harley, and the fatal memoir
      dropped from his hand upon the table. The leaves fell with a dull, low
      sound, mournful and faint as might be the tread of a ghost, if the tread
      gave sound. They fell, those still confessions of an obscure,
      uncomprehended life, amidst letters and documents eloquent of the strife
      that was then agitating millions,&mdash;the fleeting, turbulent fears and
      hopes that torture parties and perplex a nation; the stormy business of
      practical public life, so remote from individual love and individual
      sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton's eye saw them fall. The room was but partially lighted. At the
      distance where he stood, he did not recognize the characters; but
      involuntarily he shivered, and involuntarily drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold yet awhile," said Harley. "I produce my charge, and then I leave you
      to dispute the only witness that I bring. Audley Egerton, you took from me
      the gravest trust one man can confide to another. You knew how I loved
      Leonora Avenel. I was forbidden to see and urge my suit; you had the
      access to her presence which was denied to myself. I prayed you to remove
      scruples that I deemed too generous, and to woo her not to dishonour, but
      to be my wife. Was it so? Answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said Audley, his hand clenched at his heart. "You saw her
      whom I thus loved,&mdash;her thus confided to your honour. You wooed her
      for yourself. Is it so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harley, I deny it not. Cease here. I accept the penalty; I resign your
      friendship; I quit your roof; I submit to your contempt; I dare not
      implore your pardon. Cease; let me go hence, and soon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong man gasped for breath. Harley looked at him steadfastly, then
      turned away his eyes, and went on. "Nay," said he, "is that ALL? You wooed
      her for yourself,&mdash;you won her. Account to me for that life which you
      wrenched from mine. You are silent. I will take on myself your task; you
      took that life and destroyed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare me, spare me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was the fate of her who seemed so fresh from heaven when these eyes
      beheld her last? A broken heart, a dishonoured name, an early doom, a
      forgotten gravestone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no&mdash;forgotten,&mdash;no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not forgotten! Scarce a year passed, and you were married to another. I
      aided you to form those nuptials which secured your fortunes. You have had
      rank and power and fame. Peers call you the type of English gentlemen;
      priests hold you as a model of Christian honour. Strip the mask, Audley
      Egerton; let the world know you for what you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton raised his head, and folded his arms calmly; but he said, with a
      melancholy humility, "I bear all from you; it is just. Say on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You took from me the heart of Nora Avenel. You abandoned her, you
      destroyed. And her memory cast no shadow over your daily sunshine; while
      over my thoughts, over my life&mdash;oh, Egerton&mdash;Audley, Audley&mdash;how
      could you have deceived me thus!" Here the inherent tenderness under all
      this hate, the fount imbedded under the hardening stone, broke out. Harley
      was ashamed of his weakness, and hurried on,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deceived,&mdash;not for an hour, a day, but through blighted youth,
      through listless manhood,&mdash;you suffered me to nurse the remorse that
      should have been your own; her life slain, mine wasted,&mdash;and shall
      neither of us have revenge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revenge! Ah, Harley, you have had it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but I await it! Not in vain from the charnel have come to me the
      records I produce. And whom did fate select to discover the wrongs of the
      mother, whom appoint as her avenger? Your son,&mdash;your own son; your
      abandoned, nameless son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son! son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom I delivered from famine, or from worse; and who, in return, has
      given into my hands the evidence which proclaims in you the perjured
      friend of Harley L'Estrange, and the fraudulent seducer, under mock
      marriage forms&mdash;worse than all franker sin&mdash;of Leonora Avenel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false! false!" exclaimed Egerton, all his stateliness and all his
      energy restored to him. "I forbid you to speak thus to me. I forbid you by
      one word to sully the memory of my lawful wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Harley, startled. "Ah! false? prove that, and revenge is over!
      Thank Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prove it! What so easy? And wherefore have I delayed the proof; wherefore
      concealed, but from tenderness to you,&mdash;dread, too&mdash;a selfish
      but human dread&mdash;to lose in you the sole esteem that I covet; the
      only mourner who would have shed one tear over the stone inscribed with
      some lying epitaph, in which it will suit a party purpose to proclaim the
      gratitude of a nation. Vain hope. I resign it! But you spoke of a son.
      Alas, alas! you are again deceived. I heard that I had a son,&mdash;years,
      long years ago. I sought him, and found a grave. But bless you, Harley, if
      you succoured one whom you even erringly suspect to be Leonora's child!"
      He stretched forth his hands as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of your son we will speak later," said Harley, strangely softened. "But
      before I say more of him, let me ask you to explain; let me hope that you
      can extenuate what&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," interrupted Egerton, with eager quickness. "You would
      know from my own lips at last the plain tale of my own offence against
      you. It is due to both. Patiently hear me out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Egerton told all,&mdash;his own love for Nora, his struggles against
      what he felt as treason to his friend, his sudden discovery of Nora's love
      for him; on that discovery, the overthrow of all his resolutions; their
      secret marriage, their separation; Nora's flight, to which Audley still
      assigned but her groundless vague suspicion that their nuptials had not
      been legal, and her impatience of his own delay in acknowledging the rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      His listener interrupted him here with a few questions, the clear and
      prompt replies to which enabled Harley to detect Levy's plausible
      perversion of the facts; and he vaguely guessed the cause of the usurer's
      falsehood, in the criminal passion which the ill-fated bride had inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egerton," said Harley, stifling with an effort his own wrath against the
      vile deceiver both of wife and husband, "if, on reading those papers, you
      find that Leonora had more excuse for her suspicions and flight than you
      now deem, and discover perfidy in one to whom you trusted your secret,
      leave his punishment to Heaven. All that you say convinces me more and
      more that we cannot even see through the cloud, much less guide the
      thunderbolt. But proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley looked surprised and startled, and his eye turned wistfully towards
      the papers; but after a short pause he continued his recital. He came to
      Nora's unexpected return to her father's house, her death, his conquest of
      his own grief, that he might spare Harley the abrupt shock of learning her
      decease. He had torn himself from the dead, in remorseful sympathy with
      the living. He spoke of Harley's illness, so nearly fatal, repeated
      Harley's jealous words, "that he would rather mourn Nora's death, than
      take comfort from the thought that she had loved another." He spoke of his
      journey to the village where Mr. Dale had told him Nora's child was placed&mdash;"and,
      hearing that child and mother were alike gone, whom now could I right by
      acknowledging a bond that I feared would so wring your heart?" Audley
      again paused a moment, and resumed in short, nervous, impressive
      sentences. This cold, austere man of the world for the first time bared
      his heart,&mdash;unconscious, perhaps, that he did so; unconscious that he
      revealed how deeply, amidst State cares and public distinctions, he had
      felt the absence of affections; how mechanical was that outer circle in
      the folds of life which is called a "career;" how valueless wealth had
      grown&mdash;none to inherit it. Of his gnawing and progressive disease
      alone he did not speak; he was too proud and too masculine to appeal to
      pity for physical ills. He reminded Harley how often, how eagerly, year
      after year, month after month, he had urged his friend to rouse himself
      from mournful dreams, devote his native powers to his country, or seek the
      surer felicity of domestic ties. "Selfish in these attempts I might be,"
      said Egerton; "it was only if I saw you restored to happiness that I could
      believe you could calmly hear my explanation of the past, and on the floor
      of some happy home grant me your forgiveness. I longed to confess, and I
      dared not. Often have the words rushed to my lips,&mdash;as often some
      chance sentence from you repelled me. In a word, with you were so entwined
      all the thoughts and affections of my youth&mdash;even those that haunted
      the grave of Nora&mdash;that I could not bear to resign your friendship,
      and, surrounded by the esteem and honour of a world I cared not for, to
      meet the contempt of your reproachful eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst all that Audley said, amidst all that admitted of no excuse, two
      predominant sentiments stood clear, in unmistakable and touching pathos,&mdash;remorseful
      regret for the lost Nora, and self-accusing, earnest, almost feminine
      tenderness for the friend he had deceived. Thus, as he continued to speak,
      Harley more and more forgot even the remembrance of his own guilty and
      terrible interval of hate; the gulf that had so darkly yawned between the
      two closed up, leaving them still standing side by side, as in their
      schoolboy days. But he remained silent, listening, shading his face from
      Audley, and as if under some soft but enthralling spell, till Egerton thus
      closed,
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, Harley, all is told. You spoke of revenge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revenge!" muttered Harley, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And believe me," continued Egerton, "were revenge in your power, I should
      rejoice at it as an atonement. To receive an injury in return for that
      which, first from youthful passion, and afterwards from the infirmity of
      purpose that concealed the wrong, I have inflicted upon you&mdash;why,
      that would soothe my conscience, and raise my lost self-esteem. The sole
      revenge you can bestow takes the form which most humiliates me,&mdash;to
      revenge is to pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley groaned; and still hiding his face with one hand, stretched forth
      the other, but rather with the air of one who entreats than who accords
      forgiveness. Audley took and pressed the hand thus extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And NOW, Harley, farewell. With the dawn I leave this house. I cannot now
      accept your aid in this election. Levy shall announce my resignation.
      Randal Leslie, if you so please it, may be returned in my stead. He has
      abilities which, under safe guidance, may serve his country; and I have no
      right to reject from vain pride whatever will promote the career of one
      whom I undertook, and have failed, to serve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay," muttered Harley; "think not of Randal Leslie; think but of your
      son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son! But are you sure that he still lives? You smile; you&mdash;you&mdash;oh,
      Harley, I took from you the mother,&mdash;give to me the son; break my
      heart with gratitude. Your revenge is found!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange rose with a sudden start, gazed on Audley for a moment,&mdash;irresolute,
      not from resentment, but from shame. At that moment he was the man
      humbled; he was the man who feared reproach, and who needed pardon.
      Audley, not divining what was thus passing in Harley's breast, turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think that I ask too much; and yet all that I can give to the child
      of my love and the heir of my name is the worthless blessing of a ruined
      man. Harley, I say no more. I dare not add, 'You too loved his mother! and
      with a deeper and a nobler love than mine.'" He stopped short, and Harley
      flung himself on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me&mdash;me&mdash;pardon me, Audley! Your offence has been slight to
      mine. You have told me your offence; never can I name to you my own.
      Rejoice that we have both to exchange forgiveness, and in that exchange we
      are equal still, Audley, brothers still. Look up! look up! think that we
      are boys now as we were once,&mdash;boys who have had their wild quarrel,
      and who, the moment it is over, feel dearer to each other than before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Harley, this is revenge! It strikes home," murmured Egerton, and
      tears gushed fast from eyes that could have gazed unwinking on the rack.
      The clock struck; Harley sprang forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have time yet," he cried. "Much to do and to undo. You are saved from
      the grasp of Levy; your election will be won; your fortunes in much may be
      restored; you have before you honours not yet achieved; your career as yet
      is scarce begun; your son will embrace you to-morrow. Let me go&mdash;your
      hand again! Ah, Audley, we shall be so happy yet!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "There is a hitch," said Dick, pithily, when Randal joined him in the oak
      copse at ten o'clock. "Life is full of hitches."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"The art of life is to smooth them away. What hitch is this,
      my dear Avenel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"Leonard has taken huff at certain expressions of Lord
      L'Estrange's at the nomination to-day, and talks of retiring from the
      contest."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (with secret glee).&mdash;"But his resignation would smooth a
      hitch,&mdash;not create one. The votes promised to him would thus be
      freed, and go to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"The Right Honourable Red-Tapist!"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Are you serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"As an undertaker! The fact is, there are two parties among
      the Yellows as there are in the Church,&mdash;High Yellow and Low Yellow.
      Leonard has made great way with the High Yellows, and has more influence
      with them than I; and the High Yellows infinitely preferred Egerton to
      yourself. They say, 'Politics apart, he would be an honour to the
      borough.' Leonard is of the same opinion; and if he retires, I don't think
      I could coax either him or the Highflyers to make you any the better by
      his resignation."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"But surely your nephew's sense of gratitude to you would
      induce him not to go against your wishes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"Unluckily, the gratitude is all the other way. It is I who am
      under obligations to him,&mdash;not he to me. As for Lord L'Estrange, I
      can't make head or tail of his real intentions; and why he should have
      attacked Leonard in that way puzzles me more than all, for he wished
      Leonard to stand; and Levy has privately informed me that, in spite of my
      Lord's friendship for the Right Honourable, you are the man he desires to
      secure."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"He has certainly shown that desire throughout the whole
      canvass."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"I suspect that the borough-mongers have got a seat for
      Egerton elsewhere; or, perhaps, should his party come in again, he is to
      be pitchforked into the Upper House."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (smiling).&mdash;"Ah, Avenel, you are so shrewd; you see through
      everything. I will also add that Egerton wants some short respite from
      public life, in order to nurse his health and attend to his affairs,
      otherwise I could not even contemplate the chance of the electors
      preferring me to him, without a pang."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"Pang! stuff&mdash;considerable. The oak-trees don't hear us!
      You want to come into parliament, and no mistake. If I am the man to
      retire,&mdash;as I always proposed, and had got Leonard to agree to,
      before this confounded speech of L'Estrange's,&mdash;come into parliament
      you will, for the Low Yellows I can twist round my finger, provided the
      High Yellows will not interfere; in short, I could transfer to you votes
      promised to me, but I can't answer for those promised to Leonard. Levy
      tells me you are to marry a rich girl, and will have lots of money; so, of
      course, you will pay my expenses if you come in through my votes."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"My dear Avenel, certainly I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"And I have two private bills I want to smuggle through
      parliament."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"They shall be smuggled, rely on it. Mr. Fairfield being on
      one side of the House, and I on the other, we two could prevent all
      unpleasant opposition. Private bills are easily managed,&mdash;with that
      tact which I flatter myself I possess."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"And when the bills are through the House, and you have had
      time to look about you, I dare say you will see that no man can go against
      Public Opinion, unless he wants to knock his own head against a stone
      wall; and that Public Opinion is decidedly Yellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (with candour).&mdash;"I cannot deny that Public Opinion is Yellow;
      and at my age, it is natural that I should not commit myself to the policy
      of a former generation. Blue is fast wearing out. But, to return to Mr.
      Fairfield: you do not speak as if you had no hope of keeping him straight
      to what I understand to be his agreement with yourself. Surely his honour
      is engaged to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"I don't know as to honour; but he has now taken a fancy to
      public life,&mdash;at least so he said no later than this morning before
      we went into the hall; and I trust that matters will come right. Indeed, I
      left him with Parson Dale, who promised me that he would use all his best
      exertions to reconcile Leonard and my Lord, and that Leonard should do
      nothing hastily."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"But why should Mr. Fairfield retire because Lord L'Estrange
      wounds his feelings? I am sure Mr. Fairfield has wounded mine, but that
      does not make me think of retiring."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"Oh, Leonard is a poet, and poets are quite as crotchety as
      L'Estrange said they were. And Leonard is under obligations to Lord
      L'Estrange, and thought that Lord L'Estrange was pleased by his standing;
      whereas, now&mdash;In short, it is all Greek to me, except that Leonard
      has mounted his high horse, and if that throws him, I am afraid it will
      throw you. But still I have great confidence in Parson Dale,&mdash;a good
      fellow who has much influence with Leonard. And though I thought it right
      to be above-board, and let you know where the danger lies, yet one thing I
      can promise,&mdash;if I resign, you shall come in; so shake hands on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"My dear Avenel! And your wish is to resign?"
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"Certainly. I should do so a little time after noon,
      contriving to be below Leonard on the poll. You know Emanuel Trout, the
      captain of the Hundred and Fifty 'Waiters on Providence,' as they are
      called?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"To be sure I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"When Emanuel Trout comes into the booth, you will know how
      the election turns. As he votes, all the Hundred and Fifty will vote. Now
      I must go back. Good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll not forget that my expenses are to be paid. Point of honour.
      Still, if they are not paid, the election can be upset,&mdash;petition for
      bribery and corruption; and if they are paid, why, Lansmere may be your
      seat for life."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Your expenses shall be paid the moment my marriage gives me
      the means to pay them,&mdash;and that must be very soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"So Levy says. And my little jobs&mdash;the private bills?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Consider the bills passed and the jobs done."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"And one must not forget one's country. One must do the best
      one can for one's principles. Egerton is infernally Blue. You allow Public
      Opinion&mdash;is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Yellow. Not a doubt of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"Good-night. Ha, ha! humbug, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"Humbug! Between men like us,&mdash;oh, no. Good-night, my
      dear friend, I rely on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"Yes; but mind, I promise nothing if Leonard Fairfield does
      not stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL.&mdash;"He must stand; keep him to it. Your affairs, your business,
      your mill&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK.&mdash;"Very true. He must stand. I have great faith in Parson Dale."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal glided back through the park. When he came on the terrace, he
      suddenly encountered Lord L'Estrange. "I have just been privately into the
      town, my dear Lord, and heard a strange rumour, that Mr. Fairfield was so
      annoyed by some remarks in your Lordship's admirable speech, that he talks
      of retiring from the contest. That would give a new feature to the
      election, and perplex all our calculations; and I fear, in that case,
      there might be some secret coalition between Avenel's friends and our
      Committee, whom, I am told, I displeased by the moderate speech which your
      Lordship so eloquently defended,&mdash;a coalition by which Avenel would
      come in with Mr. Egerton, whereas, if we all four stand, Mr. Egerton, I
      presume, will be quite safe,&mdash;and I certainly think I have an
      excellent chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD L'ESTRANGE.&mdash;"SO Mr. Fairfield would retire in consequence of my
      remarks! I am going into the town, and I intend to apologize for those
      remarks, and retract them."
    </p>
    <p>
      RANDAL (joyously).&mdash;"Noble!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange looked at Leslie's face, upon which the stars gleamed
      palely. "Mr. Egerton has thought more of your success than of his own,"
      said he, gravely, and hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal continued on the terrace. Perhaps Harley's last words gave him a
      twinge of compunction. His head sunk musingly on his breast, and he paced
      to and fro the long gravel-walk, summoning up all his intellect to resist
      every temptation to what could injure his self-interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Skulking knave!" muttered Harley. "At least there will be nothing to
      repent, if I can do justice on him. That is not revenge. Come, that must
      be a fair retribution. Besides, how else can I deliver Violante?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed gayly, his heart was so light; and his foot bounded on as fleet
      as the deer that he startled amongst the fern.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few yards from the turnstile he overtook Richard Avenel, disguised in a
      rough great-coat and spectacles. Nevertheless, Harley's eye detected the
      Yellow candidate at the first glance. He caught Dick familiarly by the
      arm. "Well met! I was going to you. We have the election to settle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the terms I mentioned to your Lordship?" said Dick, startled. "I will
      agree to return one of your candidates; but it must not be Audley
      Egerton." Harley whispered close in Avenel's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avenel uttered an exclamation of amazement. The two gentlemen walked on
      rapidly, and conversing with great eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Avenel, at length, stopping short, "one would do a great
      deal to serve a family connection,&mdash;and a connection that does a man
      so much credit; and how can one go against one's own brother-in-law,&mdash;a
      gentleman of such high standing, pull up the whole family! How pleased
      Mrs. Richard Avenel will be! Why the devil did not I know it before? And
      poor&mdash;dear&mdash;dear Nora. Ah, that she were living!" Dick's voice
      trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her name will be righted; and I will explain why it was my fault that
      Egerton did not before acknowledge his marriage, and claim you as a
      brother. Come, then, it is all fixed and settled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my Lord; I am pledged the other way. I don't see how I can get off my
      word&mdash;to Randal Leslie. I'm not over nice, nor what is called
      Quixotic; but still my word is given that if I retire from the election, I
      will do my best to return Leslie instead of Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that through Baron Levy. But if your nephew retires?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that would solve all difficulties. But the poor boy has now a wish to
      come into parliament; and he has done me a service in the hour of need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave it to me. And as to Randal Leslie, he shall have an occasion
      himself to acquit you and redeem himself; and happy, indeed, will it be
      for him if he has yet one spark of gratitude, or one particle of honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two continued to converse for a few moments, Dick seeming to forget
      the election itself, and ask questions of more interest to his heart,
      which Harley answered so, that Dick wrung L'Estrange's hand with great
      emotion, and muttered, "My poor mother! I understand now why she would
      never talk to me of Nora. When may I tell her the truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow evening, after the election, Egerton shall embrace you all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick started, and saying, "See Leonard as soon as you can,&mdash;there is
      no time to lose," plunged into a lane that led towards the obscurer
      recesses of the town. Harley continued his way with the same light elastic
      tread which (lost during his abnegation of his own nature) was now
      restored to the foot, that seemed loath to leave a print upon the mire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the commencement of the High Street he encountered Mr. Dale and
      Fairfield, walking slowly, arm-in-arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Leonard, I was coming to you. Give me your hand. Forget for
      the present the words that justly stung and offended you. I will do more
      than apologize,&mdash;I will repair the wrong. Excuse me, Mr. Dale, I have
      one word to say in private to Leonard." He drew Fairfield aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Avenel tells me that if you were to retire from this contest, it would be
      a sacrifice of inclination. Is it so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, I have sorrows that I would fain forget; and though I at first
      shrunk from the strife in which I have been since engaged, yet now a
      literary career seems to me to have lost its old charm; and I find that,
      in public life, there is a distraction to the thoughts which embitter
      solitude, that books fail to bestow. Therefore, if you still wish me to
      continue this contest, though I know not your motive, it will not be as it
      was to begin it,&mdash;a reluctant and a painful obedience to your
      request."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand. It was a sacrifice of inclination to begin the contest; it
      would be now a sacrifice of inclination to withdraw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honestly, yes, my Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rejoice to hear it, for I ask that sacrifice,&mdash;a sacrifice which
      you will recall hereafter with delight and pride; a sacrifice sweeter, if
      I read your nature aright&mdash;oh, sweeter far, than all which
      commonplace ambition could bestow! And when you learn why I make this
      demand, you will say, 'This, indeed, is reparation for the words that
      wounded my affections, and wronged my heart.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, my Lord!" exclaimed Leonard, "the injury is repaired already.
      You give me back your esteem, when you so well anticipate my answer. Your
      esteem!&mdash;life smiles again. I can return to my more legitimate career
      without a sigh. I have no need of distraction from thought now. You will
      believe that, whatever my past presumption, I can pray sincerely for your
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poet, you adorn your career; you fulfil your mission, even at this
      moment; you beautify the world; you give to the harsh form of Duty the
      cestus of the Graces," said Harley, trying to force a smile to his
      quivering lips. "But we must hasten back to the prose of existence. I
      accept your sacrifice. As for the time and mode I must select in order to
      insure its result, I will ask you to abide by such instructions as I shall
      have occasion to convey through your uncle. Till then, no word of your
      intentions,&mdash;not even to Mr. Dale. Forgive me if I would rather
      secure Mr. Egerton's election than yours. Let that explanation suffice for
      the present. What think you, by the way, of Audley Egerton?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought when I heard him speak and when he closed with those touching
      words,&mdash;implying that he left all of his life not devoted to his
      country 'to the charity of his friends,'&mdash;how proudly, even as his
      opponent, I could have clasped his hand; and if he had wronged me in
      private life, I should have thought it ingratitude to the country he had
      so served to remember the offence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley turned away abruptly, and joined Mr. Dale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave Leonard to go home by himself; you see that I have healed whatever
      wounds I inflicted on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      PARSON.&mdash;"And, your better nature thus awakened, I trust, my dear
      Lord, that you have altogether abandoned the idea of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY.&mdash;"Revenge?&mdash;no. And if you do not approve that revenge
      to-morrow, I will never rest till I have seen you&mdash;a bishop!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. DALE (much shocked).&mdash;"My Lord, for shame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      HARLEY (seriously).&mdash;"My levity is but lip-deep, my dear Mr. Dale.
      But sometimes the froth on the wave shows the change in the tide."
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson looked at him earnestly, and then seized him by both hands with
      holy gladness and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Return to the Park now," said Harley, smiling; "and tell Violante, if it
      be not too late to see her, that she was even more eloquent than you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange bounded forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale walked back through the park to Lansmere House. On the terrace he
      found Randal, who was still pacing to and fro, sometimes in the starlight,
      sometimes in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leslie looked up, and seeing Mr. Dale, the close astuteness of his aspect
      returned; and stepping out of the starlight deep into the shadow, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was sorry to learn that Mr. Fairfield had been so hurt by Lord
      L'Estrange's severe allusions. Pity that political differences should
      interfere with private friendships; but I hear that you have been to Mr.
      Fairfield,&mdash;and, doubtless, as the peacemaker. Perhaps you met Lord
      L'Estrange by the way? He promised me that he would apologize and
      retract."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good young man!" said the unsuspecting parson, "he has done so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mr. Leonard Fairfield will, therefore, I presume, continue the
      contest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Contest&mdash;ah, this election! I suppose so, of course. But I grieve
      that he should stand against you, who seem to be disposed towards him so
      kindly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Randal, with a benevolent smile, "we have fought before, you
      know, and I beat him then. I may do so again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he walked into the house, arm-in-arm with the parson. Mr. Dale sought
      Violante; Leslie retired to his own room, and felt his election was
      secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord L'Estrange had gained the thick of the streets&mdash;passing groups
      of roaring enthusiasts&mdash;Blue and Yellow&mdash;now met with a cheer,
      now followed by a groan. Just by a public-house that formed the angle of a
      lane with the High Street, and which was all ablaze with light and all
      alive with clamour, he beheld the graceful baron leaning against the
      threshold, smoking his cigar, too refined to associate its divine vapour
      with the wreaths of shag within, and chatting agreeably with a knot of
      females, who were either attracted by the general excitement, or waiting
      to see husband, brother, father, or son, who were now joining in the
      chorus of "Blue forever!" that rang from tap-room to attic of the
      illumined hostelry. Levy, seeing Lord L'Estrange, withdrew his cigar from
      his lips, and hastened to join him. "All the Hundred and Fifty are in
      there," said the baron, with a backward significant jerk of his thumb
      towards the inn. "I have seen them all privately, in tens at a time; and I
      have been telling the ladies without that it will be best for the interest
      of their families to go home, and let us lock up the Hundred and Fifty
      safe from the Yellows, till we bring them to the poll. But I am afraid,"
      continued Levy, "that the rascals are not to be relied upon unless I
      actually pay them beforehand; and that would be disreputable, immoral,&mdash;and,
      what is more, it would upset the election. Besides, if they are paid
      beforehand, query, is it quite sure how they will vote afterwards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Avenel, I dare say, can manage them," said Harley. "Pray do nothing
      immoral, and nothing that will upset the election. I think you might as
      well go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home! No, pardon me, my Lord; there must be some head to direct the
      Committee, and keep our captains at their posts upon the doubtful
      electors. A great deal of mischief may be done between this and the
      morrow; and I would sit up all night&mdash;ay, six nights a week for the
      next three months&mdash;to prevent any awkward mistake by which Audley
      Egerton can be returned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His return would really grieve you so much?" said Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may judge of that by the zeal with which I enter into all your
      designs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a sudden and wondrously loud shout from another inn,&mdash;a
      Yellow inn, far down the lane, not so luminous as the Blue hostelry; on
      the contrary, looking rather dark and sinister, more like a place for
      conspirators or felons than honest, independent electors,&mdash;"Avenel
      forever! Avenel and the Yellows!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, my Lord, I must go back and watch over my black sheep, if I
      would have them blue!" said Levy; and he retreated towards the threshold.
      But at that shout of "Avenel forever!" as if at a signal, various electors
      of the redoubted Hundred and Fifty rushed from the Blue hostelry, sweeping
      past Levy, and hurrying down the lane to the dark little Yellow inn,
      followed by the female stragglers, as small birds follow an owl. It was
      not, however, very easy to get into that Yellow inn; Yellow Reformers,
      eminent for their zeal on behalf of purity of election, were stationed
      outside the door, and only strained in one candidate for admittance at a
      time. "After all," thought the baron, as he passed into the principal room
      of the Blue tavern, and proposed the national song of "Rule Britannia,"&mdash;"after
      all, Avenel hates Egerton as much as I do, and both sides work to the same
      end." And thrumming on the table, he joined with a fine lass in the famous
      line,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        "For Britons never will be slaves!"
</pre>
    <p>
      In the interim, Harley had disappeared within the Lansmere Arms, which was
      the headquarters of the Blue Committee. Not, however, mounting to the room
      in which a few of the more indefatigable were continuing their labours,
      receiving reports from scouts, giving orders, laying wagers, and very
      muzzy with British principles and spirits, Harley called aside the
      landlord, and inquired if the stranger, for whom rooms had been prepared,
      was yet arrived. An affirmative answer was given, and Harley followed the
      host up a private stair, to a part of the house remote from the rooms
      devoted to the purposes of the election. He remained with this stranger
      about half an hour, and then walked into the Committee-room, got rid of
      the more excited, conferred with the more sober, issued a few brief
      directions to such of the leaders as he felt he could most rely upon, and
      returned home as rapidly as he had quitted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawn was gray in the skies when Harley sought his own chamber. To gain it,
      he passed by the door of Violante's. His heart suffused with grateful
      ineffable tenderness, he paused and kissed the threshold. When he stood
      within his room (the same that he had occupied in his early youth), he
      felt as if the load of years were lifted from his bosom. The joyous,
      divine elasticity of spirit, that in the morning of life springs towards
      the Future as a bird soars into heaven, pervaded his whole sense of being.
      A Greek poet implies that the height of bliss is the sudden relief of
      pain: there is a nobler bliss still,&mdash;the rapture of the conscience
      at the sudden release from a guilty thought. By the bedside at which he
      had knelt in boyhood, Harley paused to kneel once more. The luxury of
      prayer, interrupted since he had nourished schemes of which his passions
      had blinded him to the sin, but which, nevertheless, he dared not confess
      to the All-Merciful, was restored to him. And yet, as he bowed his knee,
      the elation of spirits he had before felt forsook him. The sense of the
      danger his soul had escaped, the full knowledge of the guilt to which the
      fiend had tempted, came dread before his clearing vision; he shuddered in
      horror of himself. And he who but a few hours before had deemed it so
      impossible to pardon his fellow-man, now felt as if years of useful and
      beneficent deeds could alone purify his own repentant soul from the memory
      of one hateful passion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      But while Harley had thus occupied the hours of night with cares for the
      living, Audley Egerton had been in commune with the dead. He had taken
      from the pile of papers amidst which it had fallen, the record of Nora's
      silenced heart. With a sad wonder he saw how he had once been loved. What
      had all which successful ambition had bestowed on the lonely statesman to
      compensate for the glorious empire he had lost,&mdash;such realms of
      lovely fancy; such worlds of exquisite emotion; that infinite which lies
      within the divine sphere that unites spiritual genius with human love? His
      own positive and earthly nature attained, for the first time, and as if
      for its own punishment, the comprehension of that loftier and more
      ethereal visitant from the heavens, who had once looked with a seraph's
      smile through the prison-bars of his iron life; that celestial refinement
      of affection, that exuberance of feeling which warms into such varieties
      of beautiful idea, under the breath of the earth-beautifier, Imagination,&mdash;all
      from which, when it was all his own, he had turned half weary and
      impatient, and termed the exaggerations of a visionary romance, now that
      the world had lost them evermore, he interpreted aright as truths. Truths
      they were, although illusions. Even as the philosopher tells us that the
      splendour of colours which deck the universe is not on the surface whereon
      we think to behold it, but in our own vision; yet, take the colours from
      the universe, and what philosophy can assure us that the universe has
      sustained no loss?
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Audley came to that passage in the fragment which, though but
      imperfectly, explained the true cause of Nora's flight; when he saw how
      Levy, for what purpose he was unable to conjecture, had suggested to his
      bride the doubts that had offended him,&mdash;asserted the marriage to be
      a fraud, drawn from Audley's own brief resentful letters to Nora proof of
      the assertion, misled so naturally the young wife's scanty experience of
      actual life, and maddened one so sensitively pure into the conviction of
      dishonour,&mdash;his brow darkened, and his hand clenched. He rose and
      went at once to Levy's room. He found it deserted, inquired, learned that
      Levy was gone forth, and had left word he might not be at home for the
      night. Fortunate, perhaps, for Audley, fortunate for the baron, that they
      did not then meet. Revenge, in spite of his friend's admonition, might at
      that hour have been as potent an influence on Egerton as it had been on
      Harley, and not, as with the latter, to be turned aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley came back to his room and finished the tragic record. He traced the
      tremor of that beloved hand through the last tortures of doubt and
      despair; he saw where the hot tears had fallen; he saw where the hand had
      paused, the very sentence not concluded; mentally he accompanied his&mdash;fated
      bride in the dismal journey to her maiden home, and beheld her before him
      as he had last seen, more beautiful even in death than the face of living
      woman had ever since appeared to him; and as he bent over the last words,
      the blank that they left on the leaf, stretching pale beyond the quiver of
      the characters and the blister of the tears,&mdash;pale and blank as the
      void which departed love leaves behind it,&mdash;he felt his Heart
      suddenly stand still, its course arrested as the record closed. It beat
      again, but feebly,&mdash;so feebly! His breath became labour and pain, his
      sight grew dizzy; but the constitutional firmness and fortitude of the man
      clung to him in the stubborn mechanism of habit, his will yet fought
      against his disease, life rallied as the light flickers up in the waning
      taper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when Harley came into his friend's room, Egerton was
      asleep. But the sleep seemed much disturbed; the breathing was hard and
      difficult; the bed-clothes were partially thrown off, as if in the tossing
      of disturbed dreams; the sinewy strong arm, the broad athletic breast,
      were partly bare. Strange that so deadly a disease within should leave the
      frame such apparent power that, to the ordinary eye, the sleeping sufferer
      seemed a model of healthful vigour. One hand was thrust with uneasy
      straining over the pillows,&mdash;it had its hold on the fatal papers; a
      portion of the leaves was visible; and where the characters had been
      blurred by Nora's tears, were the traces, yet moist, of tears perhaps more
      bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley felt deeply affected; and while he still stood by the bed, Egerton
      sighed heavily and woke. He stared round him, as if perplexed and
      confused, till his eyes resting on Harley, he smiled and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "So early! Ah, I remember, it is the day for our great boat-race. We shall
      have the current against us; but you and I together&mdash;when did we ever
      lose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley's mind was wandering; it had gone back to the old Eton days. But
      Harley thought that he spoke in metaphorical allusion to the present more
      important contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, my Audley,&mdash;you and I together&mdash;when did we ever lose?
      But will you rise? I wish you would be at the polling-place to shake hands
      with your voters as they come up. By four o'clock you will be released,
      and the election won."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The election! How! what!" said Egerton, recovering himself. "I recollect
      now. Yes,&mdash;I accept this last kindness from you. I always said I
      would die in harness. Public life&mdash;I have no other. Ah, I dream
      again! Oh, Harley my son, my son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall see him after four o'clock. You will be proud of each other.
      But make haste and dress. Shall I ring the bell for your servant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," said Egerton, briefly, and sinking back. Harley quitted the room,
      and joined Randal and some of the more important members of the Blue
      Committee, who were already hurrying over their breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were anxious and nervous except Harley, who dipped his dry toast into
      his coffee, according to his ordinary abstemious Italian habit, with
      serene composure. Randal in vain tried for an equal tranquillity. But
      though sure of his election, there would necessarily follow a scene trying
      to the nerve of his hypocrisy. He would have to affect profound chagrin in
      the midst of vile joy; have to act the part of decorous high-minded
      sorrow, that by some untoward chance, some unaccountable cross-splitting,
      Randal Leslie's gain should be Audley Egerton's loss. Besides, he was
      flurried in the expectation of seeing the squire, and of appropriating the
      money which was to secure the dearest object of his ambition. Breakfast
      was soon despatched. The Committee-men, bustling for their hats, and
      looking at their watches, gave the signal for departure; yet no Squire
      Hazeldean had made his appearance. Harley, stepping from the window upon
      the terrace, beckoned to Randal, who took his hat and followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Leslie," said Harley, leaning against the balustrade, and carelessly
      patting Nero's rough, honest head, "you remember that you were good enough
      to volunteer to me the explanation of certain circumstances in connection
      with the Count di Peschiera, which you gave to the Duke di Serrano; and I
      replied that my thoughts were at present engaged on the election, but as
      soon as that was over, I should be very willing to listen to any
      communications affecting yourself and my old friend the duke, with which
      you might be pleased to favour me."
    </p>
    <p>
      This address took Randal by surprise, and did not tend to calm his nerves.
      However, he replied readily,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon that, as upon any other matter that may influence the judgment you
      form of me, I shall be but too eager to remove a single doubt that, in
      your eyes, can rest upon my honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak exceedingly well, Mr. Leslie; no man can express himself more
      handsomely; and I will claim your promise with the less scruple because
      the duke is powerfully affected by the reluctance of his daughter to
      ratify the engagement that binds his honour, in case your own is
      indisputably cleared. I may boast of some influence over the young lady,
      since I assisted to save her from the infamous plot of Peschiera; and the
      duke urges me to receive your explanation, in the belief that, if it
      satisfy me, as it has satisfied him, I may conciliate his child in favour
      of the addresses of a suitor who would have hazarded his very life against
      so redoubted a duellist as Peschiera."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange," replied Randal, bowing, "I shall indeed owe you much if
      you can remove that reluctance on the part of my betrothed bride, which
      alone clouds my happiness, and which would at once put an end to my suit,
      did I not ascribe it to an imperfect knowledge of myself, which I shall
      devote my life to improve into confidence and affection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No man can speak more handsomely," reiterated Harley, as if with profound
      admiration; and indeed he did eye Randal as we eye some rare curiosity. "I
      am happy to inform you, too," continued L'Estrange, "that if your marriage
      with the Duke of Serrano's daughter take place&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If!" echoed Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg pardon for making an hypothesis of what you claim the right to
      esteem a certainty,&mdash;I correct my expression: when your marriage with
      that young lady takes place, you will at least escape the rock on which
      many young men of ardent affections have split at the onset of the grand
      voyage. You will form no imprudent connection. In a word, I received
      yesterday a despatch from Vienna, which contains the full pardon and
      formal restoration of Alphonso, Duke di Serrano. And I may add, that the
      Austrian government (sometimes misunderstood in this country) is bound by
      the laws it administers, and can in no way dictate to the duke, once
      restored, as to the choice of his son-in-law, or as to the heritage that
      may devolve on his child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does the duke yet know of his recall?" exclaimed Randal, his cheeks
      flushed and his eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I reserve that good news, with other matters, till after the election
      is over. But Egerton keeps us waiting sadly. Ah, here comes his valet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Audley's servant approached. "Mr. Egerton feels himself rather more poorly
      than usual, my Lord; he begs you will excuse his going with you into the
      town at present. He will come later if his presence is absolutely
      necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. Pray tell him to rest and nurse himself. I should have liked him to
      witness his own triumph,&mdash;that is all. Say I will represent him at
      the polling-place. Gentlemen, are you ready? We will go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The polling booth was erected in the centre of the marketplace. The voting
      had already commenced; and Mr. Avenel and Leonard were already at their
      posts, in order to salute and thank the voters in their cause who passed
      before them. Randal and L'Estrange entered the booth amidst loud hurrahs,
      and to the national air of "See the Conquering Hero comes." The voters
      defiled in quick succession. Those who voted entirely according to
      principle or colour&mdash;which came to much the same thing&mdash;and were
      therefore above what is termed "management," flocked in first, voting
      straightforwardly for both Blues or both Yellows. At the end of the first
      half-hour the Yellows were About ten ahead of the Blues. Then sundry split
      votes began to perplex conjecture as to the result; and Randal, at the end
      of the first hour, had fifteen majority over Audley Egerton, two over Dick
      Avenel, Leonard Fairfield heading the poll by five. Randal owed his place
      in the lists to the voters that Harley's personal efforts had procured for
      him; and he was well pleased to see that Lord L'Estrange had not withdrawn
      from him a single promise so obtained. This augured well for Harley's
      ready belief in his appointed "explanations." In short, the whole election
      seemed going just as he had calculated. But by twelve o'clock there were
      some changes in the relative position of the candidates. Dick Avenel had
      gradually gained ground,&mdash;passing Randal, passing even Leonard. He
      stood at the head of the poll by a majority of ten. Randal came next.
      Audley was twenty behind Randal, and Leonard four behind Audley. More than
      half the constituency had polled, but none of the Committee on either
      side, nor one of the redoubted corps of a Hundred and Fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poll now slackened sensibly. Randal, looking round, and longing for an
      opportunity to ask Dick whether he really meant to return himself instead
      of his nephew, saw that Harley had disappeared; and presently a note was
      brought to him requesting his presence in the Committee-room. Thither he
      hastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he forced his way through the bystanders in the lobby, towards the
      threshold of the room, Levy caught hold of him and whispered, "They begin
      to fear for Egerton. They want a compromise in order to secure him. They
      will propose to you to resign, if Avenel will withdraw Leonard. Don't be
      entrapped. L'Estrange may put the question to you; but&mdash;a word in
      your ear&mdash;he would be glad enough to throw over Egerton. Rely upon
      this, and stand firm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal made no answer, but, the crowd giving way for him, entered the
      room. Levy followed. The doors were instantly closed. All the Blue
      Committee were assembled. They looked heated, anxious, eager. Lord
      L'Estrange, alone calm and cool, stood at the head of the long table.
      Despite his composure, Harley's brow was thoughtful. "Yes," said he to
      himself, "I will give this young man the fair occasion to prove gratitude
      to his benefactor; and if he here acquit himself, I will spare him, at
      least, public exposure of his deceit to others. So young, he must have
      some good in him,&mdash;at least towards the man to whom he owes all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Leslie," said L'Estrange, aloud, "you see the state of the poll. Our
      Committee believe that, if you continue to stand, Egerton must be beaten.
      They fear that, Leonard Fairfield having little chance, the Yellows will
      not waste their second votes on him, but will transfer them to you, in
      order to keep out Egerton. If you retire, Egerton will be safe. There is
      reason to suppose that Leonard would, in that case, also be withdrawn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can hope and fear nothing more from Egerton," whispered Levy. "He is
      utterly ruined; and, if he lose, will sleep in a prison. The bailiffs are
      waiting for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal was still silent, and at that silence an indignant murmur ran
      through the more influential members of the Committee. For, though Audley
      was not personally very popular, still a candidate so eminent was
      necessarily their first object, and they would seem very small to the
      Yellows, if their great man was defeated by the very candidate introduced
      to aid him,&mdash;a youth unknown. Vanity and patriotism both swelled that
      murmur. "You see, young sir," cried a rich, blunt master-butcher, "that it
      was an honourable understanding that Mr. Egerton was to be safe. You had
      no claim on us, except as fighting second to him. And we are all
      astonished that you don't say at once, 'Save Egerton, of course.' Excuse
      my freedom, sir. No time for palaver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange," said Randal, turning mildly from the butcher, "do you,
      as the first here in rank and influence, and as Mr. Egerton's especial
      friend, call upon me to sacrifice my election, and what appear to be the
      inclinations of the majority of the constituents, in order to obtain what
      is, after all, a doubtful chance of returning Mr. Egerton in my room?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not call upon you, Mr. Leslie. It is a matter of feeling or of
      honour, which a gentleman can very well decide for himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was any such compact made between your Lordship and myself, when you
      first gave me your interest and canvassed for me in person?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not. Gentlemen, be silent. No such compact was mentioned by
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither was it by Mr. Egerton. Whatever might be the understanding spoken
      of by the respected elector who addressed me, I was no party to it. I am
      persuaded that Mr. Egerton is the last person who would wish to owe his
      election to a trick upon the electors in the midst of the polling, and to
      what the world would consider a very unhandsome treatment of myself, upon
      whom all the toil of the canvass has devolved."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the murmur rose; but Randal had an air so determined, that it
      quelled resentment, and obtained a continued, though most chilling and
      half-contemptuous hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless," resumed Randal, "I would at once retire were I not under
      the firm persuasion that I shall convince all present, who now seem to
      condemn me, that I act precisely according to Mr. Egerton's own private
      inclinations. That gentleman, in fact, has never been amongst you, has not
      canvassed in person, has taken no trouble, beyond a speech, that was
      evidently meant to be but a general defence of his past political career.
      What does this mean? Simply that his standing has been merely a form, to
      comply with the wish of his party, against his own desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee-men looked at each other amazed and doubtful. Randal saw he
      had gained an advantage; he pursued it with a tact and ability which
      showed that, in spite of his mere oratorical deficiencies, he had in him
      the elements of a dexterous debater. "I will be plain with you, gentlemen.
      My character, my desire to stand well with you all, oblige me to be so.
      Mr. Egerton does not wish to come into parliament at present. His health
      is much broken; his private affairs need all his time and attention. I am,
      I may say, as a son to him. He is most anxious for my success; Lord
      L'Estrange told me but last night, very truly, 'more anxious for my
      success than his own.' Nothing could please him more than to think I were
      serving in parliament, however humbly, those great interests which neither
      health nor leisure will, in this momentous crisis, allow himself to defend
      with his wonted energy. Later, indeed, no doubt, he will seek to return to
      an arena in which he is so distinguished; and when the popular excitement,
      which produces the popular injustice of the day, is over, what
      constituency will not be proud to return such a man? In support and proof
      of what I have thus said, I now appeal to Mr. Egerton's own agent,&mdash;a
      gentleman who, in spite of his vast fortune and the rank he holds in
      society, has consented to act gratuitously on behalf of that great
      statesman. I ask you, then, respectfully, Baron Levy, Is not Mr. Egerton's
      health much broken, and in need of rest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," said Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do not his affairs necessitate his serious and undivided attention?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do indeed," quoth the baron. "Gentlemen, I have nothing to urge in
      behalf of my distinguished friend as against the statement of his adopted
      son, Mr. Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then all I can say," cried the butcher, striking his huge fist on the
      table, "is, that Mr. Egerton has behaved d&mdash;-d unhandsome to us, and
      we shall be the laughing-stock of the borough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Softly, softly," said Harley. "There is a knock at the door behind.
      Excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley quitted the room, but only for a minute or two. On his return he
      addressed himself to Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we then to understand, Mr. Leslie, that your intention is not to
      resign?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless your Lordship actually urge me to the contrary, I should say, Let
      the election go on, and all take our chance. That seems to me the fair,
      manly, ENGLISH [great emphasis on the last adjective], honourable course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," replied Harley; "'let all take their chance.' Mr. Leslie, we
      will no longer detain you. Go back to the polling-place,&mdash;one of the
      candidates should be present; and you, Baron Levy, be good enough to go
      also, and return thanks to those who may yet vote for Mr. Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy bowed, and went out arm-in-arm with Randal. "Capital, capital," said
      the baron. "You have a wonderful head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not like L'Estrange's look, nevertheless. But he can't hurt me now;
      the votes he got for me instead of for Egerton have already polled. The
      Committee, indeed, may refuse to vote for me; but then there is Avenel's
      body of reserve. Yes, the election is virtually over. When we get back,
      Hazeldean will have arrived with the money for the purchase of my
      ancestral property; Dr. Riccabocca is already restored to the estates and
      titles of Serrano; what do I care further for Lord L'Estrange? Still, I do
      not like his look."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh, you have done just what he wished. I am forbidden to say more. Here
      we are at the booth. A new placard since we left. How are the numbers?
      Avenel forty ahead of you; you thirty above Egerton; and Leonard Fairfield
      still last on the poll. But where are Avenel and Fairfield?" Both those
      candidates had disappeared, perhaps gone to their own Committee-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, as soon as the doors had closed on Randal and the baron, in the
      midst of the angry hubbub succeeding to their departure, Lord L'Estrange
      sprang upon the table. The action and his look stilled every sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, it is in our hands to return one of our candidates, and to
      make our own choice between the two. You have heard Mr. Leslie and Baron
      Levy. To their statement I make but this reply,&mdash;Mr. Egerton is
      needed by the country; and whatever his health or his affairs, he is ready
      to respond to that call. If he has not canvassed, if he does not appear
      before you at this moment, the services of more than twenty years plead
      for him in his stead. Which, then, of the two candidates do you choose as
      your member,&mdash;a renowned statesman, or a beardless boy? Both have
      ambition and ability; the one has identified those qualities with the
      history of a country, and (as it is now alleged to his prejudice) with a
      devotion that has broken a vigorous frame and injured a princely fortune.
      The other evinces his ambition by inviting you to prefer him to his
      benefactor, and proves his ability by the excuses he makes for
      ingratitude. Choose between the two,&mdash;an Egerton or a Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egerton forever!" cried all the assembly, as with a single voice,
      followed by a hiss for Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said a grave and prudent Committee-man, "have we really the choice?
      Does not that rest with the Yellows? Is not your Lordship too sanguine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open that door behind; a deputation from our opponents waits in the room
      on the other side the passage. Admit them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee were hushed in breathless silence while Harley's order was
      obeyed. And soon, to their great surprise, Leonard Fairfield himself,
      attended by six of the principal members of the Yellow party, entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD L'ESTRANGE.&mdash;"You have a proposition to make to us, Mr.
      Fairfield, on behalf of yourself and Mr. Avenel, and with the approval of
      your Committee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONARD (advancing to the table).&mdash;"I have. We are convinced that
      neither party can carry both its candidates. Mr. Avenel is safe. The only
      question is, which of the two candidates on your side it best becomes the
      honour of this constituency to select. My resignation, which I am about to
      tender, will free sufficient votes to give the triumph either to Mr.
      Egerton or to Mr. Leslie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egerton forever!" cried once more the excited Blues. "Yes, Egerton
      forever!" said Leonard, with a glow upon his cheek. "We may differ from
      his politics, but who can tell us those of Mr. Leslie? We may differ from
      the politician, but who would not feel proud of the senator? A great and
      incalculable advantage is bestowed on that constituency which returns to
      parliament a distinguished man. His distinction ennobles the place he
      represents, it sustains public spirit, it augments the manly interest in
      all that affects the nation. Every time his voice hushes the assembled
      parliament, it reminds us of our common country; and even the discussion
      amongst his constituents which his voice provokes, clears their
      perceptions of the public interest, and enlightens themselves, from the
      intellect which commands their interests, and compels their attention.
      Egerton, then, forever! If our party must subscribe to the return of one
      opponent, let all unite to select the worthiest. My Lord L'Estrange, when
      I quit this room, it will be to announce my resignation, and to solicit
      those who have promised me their votes to transfer them to Mr. Audley
      Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the uproarious huzzas which followed this speech, Leonard drew near
      to Harley. "My Lord, I have obeyed your wishes, as conveyed to me by my
      uncle, who is engaged at this moment elsewhere in carrying them into
      effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leonard," said Harley, in the same undertone, "you have insured to Audley
      Egerton what you alone could do,&mdash;the triumph over a perfidious
      dependent, the continuance of the sole career in which he has hitherto
      found the solace or the zest of life. He must thank you with his own lips.
      Come to the Park after the close of the poll. There and then shall the
      explanations yet needful to both be given and received."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Harley bowed to the assembly and raised his voice: "Gentlemen,
      yesterday, at the nomination of the candidates, I uttered remarks that
      have justly pained Mr. Fairfield. In your presence I wholly retract and
      frankly apologize for them. In your presence I entreat his forgiveness,
      and say, that if he will accord me his friendship, I will place him in my
      esteem and affection side by side with the statesman whom he has given to
      his country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard grasped the hand extended to him with both his own, and then,
      overcome by his emotions, hurried from the room; while Blues and Yellows
      exchanged greetings, rejoiced in the compromise that would dispel all
      party irritation, secure the peace of the borough, and allow quiet men,
      who had detested each other the day before, and vowed reciprocal injuries
      to trade and custom, the indulgence of all amiable and fraternal feelings&mdash;until
      the next general election.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean while the polling had gone on slowly as before, but still to
      the advantage of Randal. "Not two-thirds of the constituency will poll,"
      murmured Levy, looking at his watch. "The thing is decided. Aha, Audley
      Egerton! you who once tortured me with the unspeakable jealousy that
      bequeaths such implacable hate; you who scorned my society, and called me
      'scoundrel,' disdainful of the very power your folly placed within my
      hands,&mdash;aha, your time is up! and the spirit that administered to
      your own destruction strides within the circle to seize its prey!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have my first frank, Levy," said Randal, "to enclose your
      letter to Mr. Thornhill's solicitor. This affair of the election is over;
      we must now look to what else rests on our hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the devil is that placard?" cried Levy, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal looked, and right up the market-place, followed by an immense
      throng, moved, high over the heads of all, a Yellow Board, that seemed
      marching through the air, cometlike:&mdash;
    </p>

      "What infernal treachery is this?" cried Randal, livid with honest
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment; there is Avenel!" exclaimed Levy; and at the head of
      another procession that emerged from the obscurer lanes of the town,
      walked, with grave majesty, the surviving Yellow candidate. Dick
      disappeared for a moment within a grocer's shop in the broadest part of
      the place, and then culminated at the height of a balcony on the first
      story, just above an enormous yellow canister, significant of the
      profession and the politics of the householder. No sooner did Dick, hat in
      hand, appear on this rostrum, than the two processions halted below, bands
      ceased, flags drooped round their staves, crowds rushed within hearing,
      and even the poll clerks sprang from the booth. Randal and Levy themselves
      pressed into the throng. Dick on the balcony was the Deus ex machina.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Freemen and electors!" said Dick, with his most sonorous accents,
      "finding that the public opinion of this independent and enlightened
      constituency is so evenly divided, that only one Yellow candidate can be
      returned, and only one Blue has a chance, it was my intention last night
      to retire from the contest, and thus put an end to all bickerings and
      ill-blood (Hold your tongues there, can't you!). I say honestly, I should
      have preferred the return of my distinguished and talented young nephew&mdash;honourable
      relation&mdash;to my own; but he would not hear of it, and talked all our
      Committee into the erroneous but high-minded notion, that the town would
      cry shame if the nephew rode into parliament by breaking the back of the
      uncle." (Loud cheers from the mob, and partial cries of "We 'll have you
      both!")
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll do no such thing, and you know it; hold your jaw," resumed Dick,
      with imperious good-humour. "Let me go on, can't you?&mdash;time presses.
      In a word, my nephew resolved to retire, if, at two o'clock this day,
      there was no chance of returning both of us; and there is none. Now, then,
      the next thing for the Yellows who have not yet voted, is to consider how
      they will give their second votes. If I had been the man to retire, why,
      for certain reasons, I should have recommended them to split with Leslie,&mdash;a
      clever chap, and pretty considerable sharp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear, hear!" cried the baron, lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm bound to say that my nephew has an opinion of his own,&mdash;as
      an independent Britisher, let him be twice your nephew, ought to have; and
      his opinion goes the other way, and so does that of our Committee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sold!" cried the baron; and some of the crowd shook their heads, and
      looked grave,&mdash;especially those suspected of a wish to be bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sold! Pretty fellow you with the nosegay in your buttonhole to talk of
      selling! You who wanted to sell your own client,&mdash;and you know it.
      [Levy recoiled.] Why, gentlemen, that's Levy the Jew, who talks of
      selling! And if he asperses the character of this constituency, I stand
      here to defend it! And there stands the parish pump, with a handle for the
      arm of Honesty, and a spout for the lips of Falsehood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of this magniloquent period, borrowed, no doubt, from some
      great American orator, Baron Levy involuntarily retreated towards the
      shelter of the polling-booth, followed by some frowning Yellows with very
      menacing gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the calumniator sneaks away; leave him to the reproach of his
      conscience," resumed Dick, with a generous magnanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "SOLD! [the word rang through the place like the blast of a trumpet] Sold!
      No, believe me, not a man who votes for Egerton instead of Fairfield will,
      so far as I am concerned, be a penny the better&mdash;[chilling silence]&mdash;or
      [with a scarce perceivable wink towards the anxious faces of the Hundred
      and Fifty who filled the background]&mdash;or a penny the worse. [Loud
      cheers from the Hundred and Fifty, and cries of 'Noble!'] I don't like the
      politics of Mr. Egerton. But I am not only a politician,&mdash;I am a MAN!
      The arguments of our respected Committee&mdash;persons in business, tender
      husbands, and devoted fathers&mdash;have weight with me. I myself am a
      husband and a father. If a needless contest be prolonged to the last, with
      all the irritations it engenders, who suffer?&mdash;why, the tradesman and
      the operative. Partiality, loss of custom, tyrannical demands for house
      rent, notices to quit,&mdash;in a word, the screw!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear!" and "Give us the Ballot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Ballot&mdash;with all my heart, if I had it about me! And if we had
      the Ballot, I should like to see a man dare to vote Blue. [Loud cheers
      from the Yellows.] But, as we have not got it, we must think of our
      families. And I may add, that though Mr. Egerton may come again into
      office, yet [added Dick solemnly] I will do my best, as his colleague, to
      keep him straight; and your own enlightenment (for the schoolmaster is
      abroad) will show him that no minister can brave public opinion, nor
      quarrel with his own bread and butter. [Much cheering.] In these times the
      aristocracy must endear themselves to the middle and working class; and a
      member in office has much to give away in the Stamps and Excise, in the
      Customs, the Post Office, and other State departments in this rotten old&mdash;I
      mean this magnificent empire, by which he can benefit his constituents,
      and reconcile the prerogatives of aristocracy with the claims of the
      people,&mdash;more especially in this case, the people of the borough of
      Lausmere. [Hear, hear!]
    </p>
    <p>
      "And therefore, sacrificing party inclinations (since it seems that I can
      in no way promote them) on the Altar of General Good Feeling, I cannot
      oppose the resignation of my nephew,&mdash;honourable relation!&mdash;nor
      blind my eyes to the advantages that may result to a borough so important
      to the nation at large, if the electors think fit to choose my Right
      Honourable brother&mdash;I mean the Right Honourable Blue candidate&mdash;as
      my brother colleague. Not that I presume to dictate, or express a wish one
      way or the other; only, as a Family Man, I say to you, Electors and
      Freemen, having served your country in returning me, you have nobly won
      the right to think of the little ones at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick put his hand to his heart, bowed gracefully, and retired from the
      balcony amidst unanimous applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three minutes more Dick had resumed his place in the booth in his
      quality of candidate. A rush of Yellow electors poured in, hot and fast.
      Up came Emanuel Trout, and, in a firm voice, recorded his vote, "Avenel
      and Egerton." Every man of the Hundred and Fifty so polled. To each
      question, "Whom do you vote for?" "Avenel and Egerton" knelled on the ears
      of Randal Leslie with "damnable iteration." The young man folded his arms
      across his breast in dogged despair. Levy had to shake hands for Mr.
      Egerton with a rapidity that took away his breath. He longed to slink
      away,&mdash;longed to get at L'Estrange, whom he supposed would be as
      wroth at this turn in the wheel of fortune as himself. But how, as
      Egerton's representative, escape from the continuous gripes of those horny
      hands? Besides, there stood the parish pump, right in face of the booth,
      and some huge truculent-looking Yellows loitered round it, as if ready to
      pounce on him the instant he quitted his present sanctuary. Suddenly the
      crowd round the booth receded; Lord L'Estrange's carriage drove up to the
      spot, and Harley, stepping from it, assisted out of the vehicle an old,
      gray-haired, paralytic man. The old man stared round him, and nodded
      smilingly to the mob. "I'm here,-I'm come; I'm but a poor creature, but
      I'm a good Blue to the last!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old John Avenel,&mdash;fine old John!" cried many a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And John Avenel, still leaning on Harley's arm, tottered into the booth,
      and plumped for "Egerton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shake hands, Father," said Dick, bending forward, "though you'll not vote
      for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a Blue before you were born," answered the old man, tremulously;
      "but I wish you success all the same, and God bless you, my boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the poll-clerks were touched; and when Dick, leaving his place, was
      seen by the crowd assisting Lord L'Estrange to place poor John again in
      the carriage, that picture of family love in the midst of political
      difference&mdash;of the prosperous, wealthy, energetic son, who, as a boy,
      had played at marbles in the very kennel, and who had risen in life by his
      own exertions, and was now virtually M. P. for his native town, tending on
      the broken-down, aged father, whom even the interests of a son he was so
      proud of could not win from the colours which he associated with truth and
      rectitude&mdash;had such an effect upon the rudest of the mob there
      present, that you might have heard a pin fall,&mdash;till the carriage
      drove away back to John's humble home; and then there rose such a tempest
      of huzzas! John Avenel's vote for Egerton gave another turn to the
      vicissitudes of that memorable election. As yet Avenel had been ahead of
      Audley; but a plumper in favour of Egerton, from Avenel's own father, set
      an example and gave an excuse to many a Blue who had not yet voted, and
      could not prevail on himself to split his vote between Dick and Audley;
      and, therefore, several leading tradesmen, who, seeing that Egerton was
      safe, had previously resolved not to vote at all, came up in the last
      hour, plumped for Egerton, and carried him to the head of the poll; so
      that poor John, whose vote, involving that of Mark Fairfield, had secured
      the first opening in public life to the young ambition of the unknown
      son-in-law, still contributed to connect with success and triumph, but
      also with sorrow, and, it may be, with death, the names of the high-born
      Egerton and the humble Avenel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great town-clock strikes the hour of four; the returning officer
      declares the poll closed; the formal announcement of the result will be
      made later. But all the town knows that Audley Egerton and Richard Avenel
      are the members for Lausmere. And flags stream, and drums beat, and men
      shake each other by the hand heartily; and there is talk of the chairing
      to-morrow; and the public-houses are crowded; and there is an indistinct
      hubbub in street and alley, with sudden bursts of uproarious shouting; and
      the clouds to the west look red and lurid round the sun, which has gone
      down behind the church tower,&mdash;behind the yew-trees that overshadow
      the quiet grave of Nora Avenel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Amidst the darkening shadows of twilight, Randal Leslie walked through
      Lansmere Park towards the house. He had slunk away before the poll was
      closed,&mdash;crept through bylanes, and plunged into the leafless copses
      of the earl's stately pasture-grounds. Amidst the bewilderment of his
      thoughts&mdash;at a loss to conjecture how this strange mischance had
      befallen him, inclined to ascribe it to Leonard's influence over Avenel,
      but suspecting Harley, and half doubtful of Baron Levy&mdash;he sought to
      ascertain what fault of judgment he himself had committed, what wile he
      had forgotten, what thread in his web he had left ragged and incomplete.
      He could discover none. His ability seemed to him unimpeachable,&mdash;totus,
      teres, atque rotundas. And then there came across his breast a sharp pang,&mdash;sharper
      than that of baffled ambition,&mdash;the feeling that he had been deceived
      and bubbled and betrayed. For so vital a necessity to all living men is
      TRUTH, that the vilest traitor feels amazed and wronged, feels the pillars
      of the world shaken, when treason recoils on himself. "That Richard
      Avenel, whom I trusted, could so deceive me!" murmured Randal, and his lip
      quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still in the midst of the Park, when a man with a yellow cockade in
      his hat, and running fast from the direction of the town, overtook him
      with a letter, on delivering which the messenger, waiting for no answer,
      hastened back the way he had come. Randal recognized Avenel's hand on the
      address, broke the seal, and read as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            (Private and Confidential.)

   DEAR LESLIE,&mdash;Don't be down-hearted,&mdash;you will know to-night or
   to-morrow why I have had cause to alter my opinion as to the Right
   Honourable; and you will see that I could not, as a Family Man, act
   otherwise than I have done. Though I have not broken my word to
   you,&mdash;for you remember that all the help I promised was dependent on
   my own resignation, and would go for nothing if Leonard resigned
   instead,&mdash;yet I feel you must think yourself rather bamboozled. But
   I have been obliged to sacrifice you, from a sense of Family Duty,
   as you will soon acknowledge. My own nephew is sacrificed also; and
   I have sacrificed my own concerns, which require the whole man of me
   for the next year or two at Screwstown. So we are all in the same
   boat, though you may think you are set adrift by yourself. But I
   don't mean to stay in parliament. I shall take the Chiltern
   Hundreds, pretty considerable soon. And if you keep well with the
   Blues, I'll do my best with the Yellows to let you walk over the
   course in my stead. For I don't think Leonard will want to stand
   again. And so a word to the wise,&mdash;and you may yet be member for
   Lansmere.

                       R. A.
</pre>
    <p>
      In this letter, Randal, despite all his acuteness, could not detect the
      honest compunction of the writer. He could at first only look at the worst
      side of human nature, and fancy that it was a paltry attempt to stifle his
      just anger and ensure his discretion; but, on second thoughts, it struck
      him that Dick might very naturally be glad to be released to his mill, and
      get a quid pro quo out of Randal, under the comprehensive title,
      "repayment of expenses." Perhaps Dick was not sorry to wait until Randal's
      marriage gave him the means to make the repayment. Nay, perhaps Randal had
      been thrown over for the present, in order to wring from him better terms
      in a single election. Thus reasoning, he took comfort from his belief in
      the mercenary motives of another. True; it might be but a short
      disappointment. Before the next parliament was a month old, he might yet
      take his seat in it as member for Lansmere. But all would depend on his
      marriage with the heiress; he must hasten that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, it was necessary to knit and gather up all his thought,
      courage, and presence of mind. How he shrunk from return to Lansmere
      House,&mdash;from facing Egerton, Harley, all. But there was no choice. He
      would have to make it up with the Blues,&mdash;to defend the course he had
      adopted in the Committee-room. There, no doubt, was Squire Hazeldean
      awaiting him with the purchase-money for the lands of Rood; there was the
      Duke di Serrano, restored to wealth and honour; there was his promised
      bride, the great heiress, on whom depended all that could raise the needy
      gentleman into wealth and position. Gradually, with the elastic temper
      that is essential to a systematic schemer, Randal Leslie plucked himself
      from the pain of brooding over a plot that was defeated, to prepare
      himself for consummating those that yet seemed so near success. After all,
      should he fail in regaining Egerton's favour, Egerton was of use no more.
      He might rear his head, and face out what some might call "ingratitude,"
      provided he could but satisfy the Blue Committee. Dull dogs, how could he
      fail to do that! He could easily talk over the Machiavellian sage. He
      should have small difficulty in explaining all to the content of Audley's
      distant brother, the squire. Harley alone&mdash;but Levy had so positively
      assured him that Harley was not sincerely anxious for Egerton; and as to
      the more important explanation relative to Peschiera, surely what had
      satisfied Violante's father ought to satisfy a man who had no peculiar
      right to demand explanations at all; and if these explanations did not
      satisfy, the onus to disprove them must rest with Harley; and who or what
      could contradict Randal's plausible assertions,&mdash;assertions in
      support of which he himself could summon a witness in Baron Levy? Thus
      nerving himself to all that could task his powers, Randal Leslie crossed
      the threshold of Lansmere House, and in the hall he found the baron
      awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't account," said Levy, "for what has gone so cross in this
      confounded election. It is L'Estrange that puzzles me; but I know that he
      hates Egerton. I know that he will prove that hate by one mode of revenge,
      if he has lost it in another. But it is well, Randal, that you are secure
      of Hazeldean's money and the rich heiress's hand; otherwise&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Otherwise, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should wash my hands of you, mon cher; for, in spite of all your
      cleverness, and all I have tried to do for you, somehow or other I begin
      to suspect that your talents will never secure your fortune. A carpenter's
      son beats you in public speaking, and a vulgar mill-owner tricks you in
      private negotiation. Decidedly, as yet, Randal Leslie, you are&mdash;a
      failure. And, as you so admirably said, 'a man from whom we have nothing
      to hope or fear we must blot out of the map of the future.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's answer was cut short by the appearance of the groom of the
      chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord is in the saloon, and requests you and Mr. Leslie will do him the
      honour to join him there." The two gentlemen followed the servant up the
      broad stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saloon formed the centre room of the suite of apartments. From its
      size, it was rarely used save on state occasions. It had the chilly and
      formal aspect of rooms reserved for ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca, Violante, Helen, Mr. Dale, Squire Hazeldean, and Lord
      L'Estrange were grouped together by the cold Florentine marble table, not
      littered with books and female work, and the endearing signs of
      habitation, that give a living smile to the face of home; nothing thereon
      save a great silver candelabrum, that scarcely lighted the spacious room,
      and brought out the portraits on the walls as a part of the assembly,
      looking, as portraits do look, with searching, curious eyes upon every eye
      that turns to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as Randal entered, the squire detached himself from the group,
      and, coming to the defeated candidate, shook hands with him heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheer up, my boy; 't is no shame to be beaten. Lord L'Estrange says you
      did your best to win, and man can do no more. And I'm glad, Leslie, that
      we don't meet for our little business till the election is over; for,
      after annoyance, something pleasant is twice as acceptable. I've the money
      in my pocket. Hush! and I say, my dear, dear boy, I cannot find out where
      Frank is, but it is really all off with that foreign woman, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed, sir, I hope so. I'll talk to you about it when we can be
      alone. We may slip away presently, I trust."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you a secret scheme of mine and Harry's," said the squire, in a
      still low whisper. "We, must drive that marchioness, or whatever she is,
      out of the boy's head, and put a pretty English girl into it instead. That
      will settle him in life too. And I must try and swallow that bitter pill
      of the post-obit. Harry makes worse of it than I do, and is so hard on the
      poor fellow that I've been obliged to take his part. I've no idea of being
      under petticoat government, it is not the way with the Hazeldeans. Well,
      but to come back to the point: Whom do you think I mean by the pretty
      girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Sticktorights?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zounds, no!&mdash;your own little sister, Randal. Sweet pretty face!
      Harry liked her from the first, and then you'll be Frank's brother, and
      your sound head and good heart will keep him right. And as you are going
      to be married too (you must tell me all about that later), why, we shall
      have two marriages, perhaps, in the family on the same day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's hand grasped the squire's, and with an emotion of human
      gratitude,&mdash;for we know that, hard to all else, he had natural
      feelings for his fallen family; and his neglected sister was the one being
      on earth whom he might almost be said to love. With all his intellectual
      disdain for honest simple Frank, he knew no one in the world with whom his
      young sister could be more secure and happy. Transferred to the roof, and
      improved by the active kindness, of Mrs. Hazeldean, blest in the manly
      affection of one not too refined to censure her own deficiencies of
      education, what more could he ask for his sister, as he pictured her to
      himself, with her hair hanging over her ears, and her mind running into
      seed over some trashy novel. But before he could reply, Violante's father
      came to add his own philosophical consolations to the squire's downright
      comfortings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who could ever count on popular caprice? The wise of all ages had
      despised it. In that respect, Horace and Machiavelli were of the same
      mind," etc. "But," said the duke, with emphatic kindness "perhaps your
      very misfortune here may serve you elsewhere. The female heart is prone to
      pity, and ever eager to comfort. Besides, if I am recalled to Italy, you
      will have leisure to come with us, and see the land where, of all others,
      ambition can be most readily forgotten, even" added the Italian with a
      sigh&mdash;"even by her own sons!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus addressed by both Hazeldean and the duke, Randal recovered his
      spirits. It was clear that Lord L'Estrange had not conveyed to them any
      unfavourable impression of his conduct in the Committee-room. While Randal
      had been thus engaged, Levy had made his way to Harley, who retreated with
      the baron into the bay of the great window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my Lord, do you comprehend this conduct on the part of Richard
      Avenel? He secure Egerton's return!&mdash;he!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What so natural, Baron Levy,&mdash;his own brother-in-law?" The baron
      started, and turned very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how did he know that? I never told him. I meant indeed&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meant, perhaps, to shame Egerton's pride at the last by publicly
      declaring his marriage with a shopkeeper's daughter. A very good revenge
      still left to you; but revenge for what? A word with you, now, Baron, that
      our acquaintance is about to close forever. You know why I have cause for
      resentment against Egerton. I do but suspect yours; will you make it clear
      to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, my Lord," faltered Baron Levy, "I, too, wooed Nora Avenel as my
      wife; I, too, had a happier rival in the haughty worldling who did not
      appreciate his own felicity; I too&mdash;in a word, some women inspire an
      affection that mingles with the entire being of a man, and is fused with
      all the currents of his life-blood. Nora Avenel was one of those women."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley was startled. This burst of emotion from a man so corrupt and
      cynical arrested even the scorn he felt for the usurer. Levy soon
      recovered himself. "But our revenge is not baffled yet. Egerton, if not
      already in my power, is still in yours. His election may save him from
      arrest, but the law has other modes of public exposure and effectual
      ruin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the knave, yes,&mdash;as I intimated to you in your own house,&mdash;you
      who boast of your love to Nora Avenel, and know in your heart that you
      were her destroyer; you who witnessed her marriage, and yet dared to tell
      her that she was dishonoured!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord&mdash;I&mdash;how could you know&mdash;I mean, how think that&mdash;that&mdash;"
      faltered Levy, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nora Avenel has spoken from her grave," replied Harley, solemnly. "Learn
      that, wherever man commits a crime, Heaven finds a witness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is on me, then," said Levy, wrestling against a superstitious thrill
      at his heart&mdash;"on me that you now concentre your vengeance; and I
      must meet it as I may. But I have fulfilled my part of our compact. I have
      obeyed you implicitly&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will fulfil my part of our bond, and leave you undisturbed in your
      wealth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew I might trust to your Lordship's honour," exclaimed the usurer, in
      servile glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this vile creature nursed the same passions as myself; and but
      yesterday we were partners in the same purpose, and influenced by the same
      thought!" muttered Harley to himself. "Yes," he said aloud, "I dare not,
      Baron Levy, constitute myself your judge. Pursue your own path,&mdash;all
      roads meet at last before the common tribunal. But you are not yet
      released from our compact; you must do some good in spite of yourself.
      Look yonder, where Randal Leslie stands, smiling secure, between the two
      dangers he has raised up for himself. And as Randal Leslie himself has
      invited me to be his judge, and you are aware that he cited yourself this
      very day as his witness, here I must expose the guilty; for here the
      innocent still live, and need defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley turned away, and took his place by the table. "I have wished," said
      he, raising his voice, "to connect with the triumph of my earliest and
      dearest friend the happiness of others in whose welfare I feel an
      interest. To you, Alphonso, Duke of Serrano, I now give this despatch,
      received last evening by a special messenger from the Prince Von &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      announcing your restoration to your lands and honours."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire stared with open mouth. "Rickeybockey a duke? Why, Jemima's a
      duchess! Bless me, she is actually crying!" And his good heart prompted
      him to run to his cousin and cheer her up a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante glanced at Harley, and flung herself on her father's breast.
      Randal involuntarily rose, and moved to the duke's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, Mr. Randal Leslie," continued Harley, "though you have lost your
      election, see before you at this moment such prospects of wealth and
      happiness, that I shall only have to offer you congratulations to which
      those that greet Mr. Audley Egerton may well appear lukewarm and insipid,
      provided you prove that you have not forfeited the right to claim that
      promise which the Duke di Serrano has accorded to the suitor of his
      daughter's hand. Some doubts resting on my mind, you have volunteered to
      dispel them. I have the duke's permission to address to you a few
      questions, and I now avail myself of your offer to reply to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now,&mdash;and here, my Lord?" said Randal, glancing round the room, as
      if deprecating the presence of so many witnesses. "Now,&mdash;and here.
      Nor are those present so strange to your explanations as your question
      would imply. Mr. Hazeldean, it so happens that much of what I shall say to
      Mr. Leslie concerns your son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal's countenance fell. An uneasy tremor now seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son! Frank? Oh, then, of course, Randal will speak out. Speak, my
      boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal remained silent. The duke looked at his working face, and drew away
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young man, can you hesitate?" said he. "A doubt is expressed which
      involves your honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'s death!" cried the squire, also gazing on Randal's cowering eye and
      quivering lip, "what are you afraid of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid!" said Randal, forced into speech, and with a hollow laugh&mdash;"afraid?&mdash;I?
      What of? I was only wondering what Lord L'Estrange could mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will dispel that wonder at once. Mr. Hazeldean, your son displeased you
      first by his proposals of marriage to the Marchesa di Negra against your
      consent; secondly, by a post-obit bond granted to Baron Levy. Did you
      understand from Mr. Randal Leslie that he had opposed or favoured the said
      marriage,&mdash;that he had countenanced or blamed the said post-obit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course," cried the squire, "that he had opposed both the one and
      the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it so, Mr. Leslie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;my affection for Frank, and my esteem for
      his respected father&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;" (He nerved himself, and went
      on with firm voice)&mdash;"Of course, I did all I could to dissuade Frank
      from the marriage; and as to the post-obit, I know nothing about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much at present for this matter. I pass on to the graver one, that
      affects your engagement with the Duke di Serrano's daughter. I understand
      from you, Duke, that to save your daughter from the snares of Count di
      Peschiera, and in the belief that Mr. Leslie shared in your dread of the
      count's designs, you, while in exile and in poverty, promised to that
      gentleman your daughter's hand? When the probabilities of restoration to
      your principalities seemed well-nigh certain, you confirmed that promise
      on learning from Mr. Leslie that he had, however ineffectively, struggled
      to preserve your heiress from a perfidious snare. Is it not so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Had I succeeded to a throne, I could not recall the promise
      that I had given in penury and banishment; I could not refuse to him who
      would have sacrificed worldly ambition in wedding a penniless bride, the
      reward of his own generosity. My daughter subscribes to my views."
    </p>
    <p>
      Violante trembled, and her hands were locked together; but her gaze was
      fixed on Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dale wiped his eyes, and thought of the poor refugee feeding on
      minnows, and preserving himself from debt amongst the shades of the
      Casino.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your answer becomes you, Duke," resumed Harley. "But should it be proved
      that Mr. Leslie, instead of wooing the princess for herself, actually
      calculated on the receipt of money for transferring her to Count
      Peschiera; instead of saving her from the dangers you dreaded, actually
      suggested the snare from which she was delivered,&mdash;would you still
      deem your honour engaged to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a villain? No, surely not!" exclaimed the duke. "But this is a
      groundless hypothesis! Speak, Randal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord L'Estrange cannot insult me by deeming it otherwise than a
      groundless hypothesis!" said Randal, striving to rear his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand then, Mr. Leslie, that you scornfully reject such a
      supposition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scornfully&mdash;yes. And," continued Randal, advancing a step, "since
      the supposition has been made, I demand from Lord L'Estrange, as his equal
      (for all gentlemen are equals where honour is to be defended at the cost
      of life), either instant retractation&mdash;or instant proof."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the first word you have spoken like a man," cried the squire. "I
      have stood my ground myself for a less cause. I have had a ball through my
      right shoulder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your demand is just," said Harley, unmoved. "I cannot give the
      retractation,&mdash;I will produce the proof."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and rang the bell; the servant entered, received his whispered
      order, and retired. There was a pause painful to all. Randal, however, ran
      over in his fearful mind what evidence could be brought against him&mdash;and
      foresaw none. The folding doors of the saloon were thrown open and the
      servant announced&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          THE COUNT DI PESCHIERA.
</pre>
    <p>
      A bombshell, descending through the roof could not have produced a more
      startling sensation. Erect, bold, with all the imposing effect of his form
      and bearing, the count strode into the centre of the ring; and after a
      slight bend of haughty courtesy, which comprehended all present, reared up
      his lofty head, and looked round, with calm in his eye and a curve on his
      lip,&mdash;the self-assured, magnificent, high-bred Daredevil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Duke di Serrano," said the count, in English, turning towards his
      astounded kinsman, and in a voice that, slow, clear, and firm, seemed to
      fill the room, "I returned to England on the receipt of a letter from my
      Lord L'Estrange, and with a view, it is true, of claiming at his hands the
      satisfaction which men of our birth accord to each other, where affront,
      from what cause soever, has been given or received. Nay, fair kinswoman,"&mdash;and
      the count, with a slight but grave smile, bowed to Violante, who had
      uttered a faint cry,&mdash;"that intention is abandoned. If I have adopted
      too lightly the old courtly maxim, that 'all stratagems are fair in love,'
      I am bound also to yield to my Lord L'Estrange's arguments, that the
      counter-stratagems must be fair also. And, after all, it becomes me better
      to laugh at my own sorry figure in defeat, than to confess myself gravely
      mortified by an ingenuity more successful than my own." The count paused,
      and his eye lightened with sinister fire, which ill suited the raillery of
      his tone and the polished ease of his bearing. "Ma foi!" he continued, "it
      is permitted me to speak thus, since at least I have given proofs of my
      indifference to danger, and my good fortune when exposed to it. Within the
      last six years I have had the honour to fight nine duels, and the regret
      to wound five, and dismiss from the world four, as gallant and worthy
      gentlemen as ever the sun shone upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monster!" faltered the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire stared aghast, and mechanically rubbed the shoulder which had
      been lacerated by Captain Dashinore's bullet. Randal's pale face grew yet
      more pale, and the eye he had fixed upon the count's hardy visage quailed
      and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," resumed the count, with a graceful wave of the hand, "I have to
      thank my Lord L'Estrange for reminding me that a man whose courage is
      above suspicion is privileged not only to apologize if he has injured
      another, but to accompany apology with atonement. Duke of Serrano, it is
      for that purpose that I am here. My Lord, you have signified your wish to
      ask me some questions of serious import as regards the duke and his
      daughter; I will answer them without reserve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur le Comte," said Harley, "availing myself of your courtesy, I
      presume to inquire who informed you that this young lady was a guest under
      my father's roof?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My informant stands yonder,&mdash;Mr. Randal Leslie; and I call upon
      Baron Levy to confirm my statement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said the baron, slowly, and as if overmastered by the tone
      and mien of an imperious chieftain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a low sound like a hiss from Randal's livid lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was Mr. Leslie acquainted with your project for securing the person
      and hand of your young kinswoman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly,&mdash;and Baron Levy knows it." The baron bowed assent.
      "Permit me to add&mdash;for it is due to a lady nearly related to myself&mdash;that
      it was, as I have since learned, certain erroneous representations made to
      her by Mr. Leslie which alone induced that lady, after my own arguments
      had failed, to lend her aid to a project which otherwise she would have
      condemned as strongly as, Duke di Serrano, I now with unfeigned sincerity
      do myself condemn it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was about the count, as he thus spoke, so much of that personal
      dignity which, whether natural or artificial, imposes for the moment upon
      human judgment,&mdash;a dignity so supported by the singular advantages of
      his superb stature, his handsome countenance, his patrician air,&mdash;that
      the duke, moved by his good heart, extended his hand to the perfidious
      kinsman, and forgot all the Machiavellian wisdom which should have told
      him how little a man of the count's hardened profligacy was likely to be
      influenced by any purer motives, whether to frank confession or to manly
      repentance. The count took the hand thus extended to him, and bowed his
      face, perhaps to conceal the smile which would have betrayed his secret
      soul. Randal still remained mute, and pale as death. His tongue clove to
      his mouth. He felt that all present were shrinking from his side. At last,
      with a violent effort, he faltered out, in broken sentences,
    </p>
    <p>
      "A charge so sudden may well&mdash;may well confound me. But&mdash;but&mdash;who
      can credit it? Both the law and commonsense pre-suppose some motive for a
      criminal action; what could be my motive here? I&mdash;myself the suitor
      for the hand of the duke's daughter&mdash;I betray her! Absurd&mdash;absurd!
      Duke, Duke, I put it to your own knowledge of mankind whoever goes thus
      against his own interest&mdash;and&mdash;and his own heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This appeal, however feebly made, was not without effect on the
      philosopher. "That is true," said the duke, dropping his kinsman's hand;
      "I see no motive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Harley, "Baron Levy may here enlighten us. Do you know of
      any motive of self-interest that could have actuated Mr. Leslie in
      assisting the count's schemes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy hesitated. The count took up the word. "Pardieu!" said he, in his
      clear tone of determination and will&mdash;"pardieu! I can have no doubt
      thrown on my assertion, least of all by those who know of its truth; and I
      call upon you, Baron Levy, to state whether, in case of my marriage with
      the duke's daughter, I had not agreed to present my sister with a sum, to
      which she alleged some ancient claim, and which would have passed through
      your hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, that is true," said the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would Mr. Leslie have benefited by any portion of that sum?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy paused again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, sir," said the count, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is," said the baron, "that Mr. Leslie was anxious to complete a
      purchase of certain estates that had once belonged to his family, and that
      the count's marriage with the signora, and his sister's marriage with Mr.
      Hazeldean, would have enabled me to accommodate Mr. Leslie with a loan to
      effect that purchase."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! what!" exclaimed the squire, hastily buttoning his breast-pocket
      with one hand, while he seized Randal's arm with the other&mdash;"my son's
      marriage! You lent yourself to that, too? Don't look so like a lashed
      hound! Speak out like a man, if man you be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lent himself to that, my good sir!" said the count. "Do you suppose that
      the Marchesa di Negra could have condescended to an alliance with a Mr.
      Hazeldean&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Condescended! a Hazeldean of Hazeldean!" exclaimed the squire, turning
      fiercely, and half choked with indignation. "Unless," continued the count,
      imperturbably, "she had been compelled by circumstances to do that said
      Mr. Hazeldean the honour to accept a pecuniary accommodation, which she
      had no other mode to discharge? And here, sir, the family of Hazeldean, I
      am bound to say, owe a great debt of gratitude to Mr. Leslie; for it was
      he who most forcibly represented to her the necessity for this
      misalliance; and it was he, I believe, who suggested to my friend the
      baron the mode by which Mr. Hazeldean was best enabled to afford the
      accommodation my sister deigned to accept."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mode! the post-obit!" ejaculated the squire, relinquishing his hold of
      Randal to lay his gripe upon Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron shrugged his shoulders. "Any friend of Mr. Frank Hazeldean's
      would have recommended the same, as the most economical mode of raising
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Parson Dale, who had at first been more shocked than any one present at
      these gradual revelations of Randal's treachery, now turning his eyes
      towards the young man, was so seized with commiseration at the sight of
      Randal's face, that he laid his hand on Harley's arm, and whispered him,
      "Look, look at that countenance!&mdash;and one so young! Spare him, spare
      him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Leslie," said Harley, in softened tones, "believe me that nothing
      short of justice to the Duke di Serrano&mdash;justice even to my young
      friend Mr. Hazeldean&mdash;has compelled me to this painful duty. Here let
      all inquiry terminate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," said the count, with exquisite blandness, "since I have been
      informed by my Lord L'Estrange that Mr. Leslie has represented as a
      serious act on his part that personal challenge to myself, which I
      understood was but a pleasant and amicable arrangement in our baffled
      scheme, let me assure Mr. Leslie that if he be not satisfied with the
      regret that I now express for the leading share I have taken in these
      disclosures, I am wholly at Mr. Leslie's service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace, homicide," cried the parson, shuddering; and he glided to the side
      of the detected sinner, from whom all else had recoiled in loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craft against craft, talent against talent, treason against treason&mdash;in
      all this Randal Leslie would have risen superior to Giulio di Peschiera.
      But what now crushed him was not the superior intellect,&mdash;it was the
      sheer brute power of audacity and nerve. Here stood the careless,
      unblushing villain, making light of his guilt, carrying it away from
      disgust itself, with resolute look and front erect. There stood the abler,
      subtler, profounder criminal, cowering, abject, pitiful; the power of mere
      intellectual knowledge shivered into pieces against the brazen metal with
      which the accident of constitution often arms some ignobler nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast was striking, and implied that truth so universally felt, yet
      so little acknowledged in actual life, that men with audacity and force of
      character can subdue and paralyze those far superior to themselves in
      ability and intelligence. It was these qualities which made Peschiera
      Randal's master; nay, the very physical attributes of the count, his very
      voice and form, his bold front and unshrinking eye, overpowered the acuter
      mind of the refining schemer, as in a popular assembly some burly Cleon
      cows into timorous silence every dissentient sage. But Randal turned in
      sullen impatience from the parson's whisper, that breathed comfort or
      urged repentance; and at length said, with clearer tones than he had yet
      mustered,
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not a personal conflict with the Count di Peschiera that can
      vindicate my honour; and I disdain to defend myself against the
      accusations of a usurer, and of a mam who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur!" said the count, drawing himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man who," persisted Randal, though he trembled visibly, "by his own
      confession, was himself guilty of all the schemes in which he would
      represent me as his accomplice, and who now, not clearing himself, would
      yet convict another&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cher petit monsieur!" said the count, with his grand air of disdain,
      "when men like me make use of men like you, we reward them for a service
      if rendered, or discard them if the service be not done; and if I
      condescend to confess and apologize for any act I have committed, surely
      Mr. Randal Leslie might do the same without disparagement to his dignity.
      But I should never, sir, have taken the trouble to appear against you, had
      you not, as I learn, pretended to the hand of the lady whom I had hoped,
      with less presumption, to call my bride; and in this, how can I tell that
      you have not tricked and betrayed me? Is there anything in our past
      acquaintance that warrants me to believe that, instead of serving me, you
      sought but to serve yourself? Be that as it may, I had but one mode of
      repairing to the head of my house the wrongs I have done him, and that was
      by saving his daughter from a derogatory alliance with an impostor who had
      abetted my schemes for hire, and who now would filch for himself their
      fruit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Duke!" exclaimed Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke turned his back. Randal extended his hands to the squire. "Mr.
      Hazeldean&mdash;what? you, too, condemn me, and unheard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unheard!&mdash;zounds, no! If you have anything to say, speak truth, and
      shame the devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I abet Frank's marriage! I sanction the post-obit! Oh!" cried Randal,
      clinging to a straw, "if Frank himself were but here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley's compassion vanished before this sustained hypocrisy.

      "You wish for the presence of Frank Hazeldean? It is just." Harley opened
      the door of the inner room, and Frank appeared at the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son! my son!" cried the squire, rushing forward, and clasping Frank to
      his broad, fatherly breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affecting incident gave a sudden change to the feelings of the
      audience, and for a moment Randal himself was forgotten. The young man
      seized that moment. Reprieved, as it were, from the glare of contemptuous,
      accusing eyes, slowly he crept to the door, slowly and noiselessly, as the
      viper, when it is wounded, drops its crest and glides writhing through the
      grass. Levy followed him to the threshold, and whispered in his ear,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not help it,&mdash;you would have done the same by me. You see
      you have failed in everything; and when a man fails completely, we both
      agreed that we must give him up altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal said not a word, and the baron marked his shadow fall on the broad
      stairs, stealing down, down, step after step, till it faded from the
      stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he was of some use," muttered Levy. "His treachery and his exposure
      will gall the childless Egerton. Some little revenge still!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The count touched the arm of the musing usurer,
    </p>
    <p>
      "J'ai bien joue mon role, n'est ce pas?"&mdash;(I have well played my
      part, have I not?)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your part! Ah, but, my dear count, I do not quite understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ma foi, you are passably dull. I had just been landed in France, when a
      letter from L'Estrange reached me. It was couched as an invitation, which
      I interpreted to&mdash;the duello. Such invitations I never refuse. I
      replied: I came hither, took my lodgings at an inn. My Lord seeks me last
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I begin in the tone you may suppose. Pardieu! he is clever, milord! He
      shows me a letter from the Prince Von &mdash;&mdash;-, Alphonse's recall,
      my own banishment. He places before me, but with admirable suavity, the
      option of beggary and ruin, or an honourable claim on Alphonso's
      gratitude. And as for that petit monsieur, do you think I could quietly
      contemplate my own tool's enjoyment of all I had lost myself? Nay, more,
      if that young Harpagon were Alphonso's son-inlaw, could the duke have a
      whisperer at his ear more fatal to my own interests? To be brief, I saw at
      a glance my best course. I have adopted it. The difficulty was to
      extricate myself as became a man de sang et de jeu. If I have done so,
      congratulate me. Alphonso has taken my hand, and I now leave it to him to
      attend to my fortunes, and clear up my repute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are going to London," said Levy, "my carriage, ere this, must be
      at the door, and I shall be proud to offer you a seat, and converse with
      you on your prospects. But, peste, mon cher, your fall has been from a
      great height, and any other man would have broken his bones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strength is ever light," said the count, smiling; "and it does not fall;
      it leaps down and rebounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy looked at the count, and blamed himself for having disparaged
      Peschiera and overrated Randal.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conference went on, Harley was by Violante's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have kept my promise to you," said he, with a kind of tender humility.
      "Are you still so severe on me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," answered Violante, gazing on his noble brow, with all a woman's
      pride in her eloquent, admiring eyes, "I have heard from Mr. Dale that you
      have achieved a conquest over yourself, which makes me ashamed to think
      that I presumed to doubt how your heart would speak when a moment of wrath
      (though of wrath so just) had passed away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Violante, do not acquit me yet; witness my revenge (for I have not
      foregone it), and then let my heart speak, and breathe its prayer that the
      angel voice, which it now beats to hear, may still be its guardian
      monitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this?" cried an amazed voice; and Harley, turning round, saw that
      the duke was by his side; and, glancing with ludicrous surprise, now to
      Harley, now to Violante, "Am I to understand that you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have freed you from one suitor for this dear hand, to become myself your
      petitioner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Corpo di Bacco!" cried the sage, almost embracing Harley, "this, indeed,
      is joyful news. But I must not again make a rash pledge,&mdash;not again
      force my child's inclinations. And Violante; you see, is running away."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke stretched out his arm, and detained his child. He drew her to his
      breast, and whispered in her ear. Violante blushed crimson, and rested her
      head on his shoulder. Harley eagerly pressed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," said the duke, joining Harley's hand with his daughter's, "I
      don't think I shall hear much more of the convent; but anything of this
      sort I never suspected. If there be a language in the world for which
      there is no lexicon nor grammar, it is that which a woman thinks in, but
      never speaks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all that is left of the language spoken in paradise," said Harley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the dialogue between Eve and the serpent,&mdash;yes," quoth the
      incorrigible sage. "But who comes here?&mdash;our friend Leonard."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard now entered the room; but Harley could scarcely greet him, before
      he was interrupted by the count. "Milord," said Peschiera, beckoning him
      aside, "I have fulfilled my promise, and I will now leave your roof. Baron
      Levy returns to London, and offers me a seat in his carriage, which is
      already, I believe, at your door. The duke and his daughter will readily
      forgive me if I do not ceremoniously bid them farewell. In our altered
      positions, it does not become me too intrusively to claim kindred; it
      became me only to remove, as I trust I have done, a barrier against the
      claim. If you approve my conduct, you will state your own opinion to the
      duke." With a profound salutation the count turned to depart; nor did
      Harley attempt to stay him, but attended him down the stairs with polite
      formality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember only, my Lord, that I solicit nothing. I may allow myself to
      accept,&mdash;voilia tout." He bowed again, with the inimitable grace of
      the old regime, and stepped into the baron's travelling carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levy, who had lingered behind, paused to accost L'Estrange. "Your Lordship
      will explain to Mr. Egerton how his adopted son deserved his esteem, and
      repaid his kindness. For the rest, though you have bought up the more
      pressing and immediate demands on Mr. Egerton, I fear that even your
      fortune will not enable you to clear those liabilities which will leave
      him, perhaps, a pauper!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baron Levy," said Harley, abruptly, "if I have forgiven Mr. Egerton,
      cannot you too forgive? Me he has wronged; you have wronged him, and more
      foully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my Lord, I cannot forgive him. You he has never humiliated, you he
      has never employed for his wants, and scorned as his companion. You have
      never known what it is to start in life with one whose fortunes were equal
      to your own, whose talents were not superior. Look you, Lord L'Estrange,
      in spite of this difference between me and Egerton, that he has squandered
      the wealth that he gained without effort, while I have converted the
      follies of others into my own ample revenues, the spendthrift in his
      penury has the respect and position which millions cannot bestow upon me.
      You would say that I am an usurer, and he is a statesman. But do you know
      what I should have been, had I not been born the natural son of a peer?
      Can you guess what I should have been if Nora Avenel had been my wife? The
      blot on my birth, and the blight on my youth, and the knowledge that he
      who was rising every year into the rank which entitled him to reject me as
      a guest at his table&mdash;he whom the world called the model of a
      gentleman&mdash;was a coward and a liar to the friend of his youth,&mdash;all
      this made me look on the world with contempt; and, despising Audley
      Egerton, I yet hated him and envied. You, whom he wronged, stretch your
      hand as before to the great statesman; from my touch you would shrink as
      pollution. My Lord, you may forgive him whom you love and pity; I cannot
      forgive him whom I scorn and envy. Pardon my prolixity. I now quit your
      house." The baron moved a step, then, turning back, said with a withering
      sneer,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you will tell Mr. Egerton how I helped to expose the son he adopted!
      I thought of the childless man when your Lordship imagined I was but in
      fear of your threats. Ha! ha! that will sting."
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron gnashed his teeth as, hastily entering the carriage, he drew
      down the blinds. The post-boys cracked their whips, and the wheels rolled
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can judge," thought Harley, "through what modes retribution comes
      home to the breast? That man is chastised in his wealth, ever gnawed by
      desire for what his wealth cannot buy!" He roused himself, cleared his
      brow, as from a thought that darkened and troubled; and, entering the
      saloon, laid his hand upon Leonard's shoulder, and looked, rejoicing, into
      the poet's mild, honest, lustrous eyes. "Leonard," said he, gently, "your
      hour is come at last."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Audely Egerton was alone in his apartment. A heavy sleep had come over
      him, shortly after Harley and Randal had left the house in the early
      morning; and that sleep continued till late in the day. All the while the
      town of Lansmere had been distracted in his cause, all the while so many
      tumultuous passions had run riot in the contest that was to close or
      re-open for the statesman's ambition the Janus gates of political war, the
      object of so many fears and hopes, schemes and counter-schemes, had
      slumbered quietly as an infant in the cradle. He woke but in time to
      receive Harley's despatch, announcing the success of his election; and
      adding, "Before the night you shall embrace your son. Do not join us below
      when I return. Keep calm,&mdash;we will come to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, though not aware of the dread nature of Audley's complaint, with
      its warning symptoms, Lord L'Estrange wished to spare to his friend the
      scene of Randal's exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the receipt of that letter Egerton rose. At the prospect of seeing his
      son&mdash;Nora's son&mdash;the very memory of his disease vanished. The
      poor, weary, over-laboured heart indeed beat loud, and with many a jerk
      and spasm. He heeded it not. The victory, that restored him to the sole
      life for which he had hitherto cared to live, was clean forgotten. Nature
      claimed her own,&mdash;claimed it in scorn of death, and in oblivion of
      renown.
    </p>
    <p>
      There sat the man, dressed with his habitual precision,&mdash;the black
      coat, buttoned across the broad breast; his countenance, so mechanically
      habituated to self-control, still revealing little of emotion, though the
      sickly flush came and went on the bronzed cheek, and the eye watched the
      hand of the clock, and the ear hungered for a foot-tread along the
      corridor. At length the sound was heard,&mdash;steps, many steps. He
      sprung to his feet, he stood on the hearth. Was the hearth to be solitary
      no more? Harley entered first. Egerton's eyes rested on him eagerly for a
      moment, and strained onward across the threshold. Leonard came next,&mdash;Leonard
      Fairfield, whom he had seen as his opponent! He began to suspect, to
      conjecture, to see the mother's tender eyes in the son's manly face.
      Involuntarily he opened his arms; but, Leonard remaining still, let them
      fall with a deep sigh, and fancied himself deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend," said Harley, "I give to you a son proved in adversity, and who
      has fought his own way to fame. Leonard, in the man to whom I prayed you
      to sacrifice your own ambition, of whom you have spoken with such worthy
      praise, whose career of honour you have promoted, and whose life,
      unsatisfied by those honours, you will soothe with your filial love,
      behold the husband of Nora Avenel! Kneel to your father! O Audley, embrace
      your son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, here!" exclaimed Egerton, as Leonard bent his knee,&mdash;"here to
      my heart! Look at me with those eyes!&mdash;kindly, forgivingly: they are
      your mother's!" His proud head sunk on his son's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this is not enough," said Harley, leading Helen, and placing her by
      Leonard's side. "You must open your heart for more. Take into its folds my
      sweet ward and daughter. What is a home without the smile of woman? They
      have loved each other from children. Audley, yours be the hand to join,&mdash;yours
      be the lips to bless."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard started anxiously. "Oh, sir!&mdash;oh, my father!&mdash;this
      generous sacrifice may not be; for he&mdash;he who has saved me for this
      surpassing joy&mdash;he too loves her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Leonard," said Harley, smiling, "I am not so neglectful of myself.
      Another home woos you, Audley. He whom you long so vainly sought to
      reconcile to life, exchanging mournful dreams for happy duties,&mdash;he,
      too, presents you to his bride. Love her for my sake,&mdash;for your own.
      She it is, not I, who presides over this hallowed reunion. But for her, I
      should have been a blinded, vindictive, guilty, repentant man; and&mdash;"
      Violante's soft hand was on his lips. "Thus," said the parson, with mild
      solemnity, "man finds that the Saviour's precepts, 'Let not the sun go
      down upon thy wrath,' and 'Love one another,' are clews that conduct us
      through the labyrinth of human life, when the schemes of fraud and hate
      snap asunder, and leave us lost amidst the maze."
    </p>
    <p>
      Egerton reared his head, as if to answer; and all present were struck and
      appalled by the sudden change that had come over his countenance. There
      was a film upon the eye, a shadow on the aspect; the words failed his
      lips; he sunk on the seat beside him. The left hand rested droopingly upon
      the piles of public papers and official documents, and the fingers played
      with them, as the bedridden dying sufferer plays with the coverlid he will
      soon exchange for the winding-sheet. But his right hand seemed to feel, as
      through the dark, for the recovered son; and having touched what it
      sought, feebly drew Leonard near and nearer. Alas! that blissful PRIVATE
      LIFE&mdash;that close centre round the core of being in the individual man&mdash;so
      long missed and pined for, slipped from him, as it were, the moment it
      reappeared; hurried away, as the circle on the ocean, which is scarce seen
      ere it vanishes amidst infinity. Suddenly both hands were still; the head
      fell back. Joy had burst asunder the last ligaments, so fretted away in
      unrevealing sorrow. Afar, their sound borne into that room, the joy-bells
      were pealing triumph; mobs roaring out huzzas; the weak cry of John Avenel
      might be blent in those shouts, as the drunken zealots reeled by his
      cottage door, and startled the screaming ravens that wheeled round the
      hollow oak. The boom which is sent from the waves on the surface of life,
      while the deeps are so noiseless in their march, was wafted on the wintry
      air into the chamber of the statesman it honoured, and over the grass
      sighing low upon Nora's grave. But there was one in the chamber, as in the
      grave, for whom the boom on the wave had no sound, and the march of the
      deep had no tide. Amidst promises of home, and union, and peace, and fame,
      Death strode into the household ring, and, seating itself, calm and still,
      looked life-like,&mdash;warm hearts throbbing round it; lofty hopes
      fluttering upward; Love kneeling at its feet; Religion, with lifted
      finger, standing by its side.

      FINAL CHAPTER.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   SCENE&mdash;The Hall in the Old Tower of CAPTAIN ROLAND DE CAXTON.
</pre>
    <p>
      "But you have not done?" said Augustine Caxton.
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"What remains to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"What! why, the Final Chapter!&mdash;the last news you
      can give us of those whom you have introduced to our liking or dislike."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS.&mdash;"Surely it is more dramatic to close the work with a
      scene that completes the main design of the plot, and leave it to the
      prophetic imagination of all whose flattering curiosity is still not
      wholly satisfied, to trace the streams of each several existence, when
      they branch off again from the lake in which their waters converge, and by
      which the sibyl has confirmed and made clear the decree that 'Conduct is
      Fate.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"More dramatic, I grant; but you have not written a
      drama. A novelist should be a comfortable, garrulous, communicative,
      gossiping fortune-teller; not a grim, laconical, oracular sibyl. I like a
      novel that adopts all the old-fashioned customs prescribed to its art by
      the rules of the Masters,&mdash;more especially a novel which you style
      'My Novel' par emphasis."
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN ROLAND.&mdash;"A most vague and impracticable title 'My Novel'! It
      must really be changed before the work goes in due form to the public."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS.&mdash;"Certainly the present title cannot be even pronounced
      by many without inflicting a shock upon their nervous system. Do you
      think, for instance, that my friend, Lady Priscilla Graves&mdash;who is a
      great novel-reader indeed, but holds all female writers unfeminine
      deserters to the standard of Man&mdash;could ever come out with, 'Pray,
      sir, have you had time to look at&mdash;MY Novel?'&mdash;She would rather
      die first. And yet to be silent altogether on the latest acquisition to
      the circulating libraries would bring on a functional derangement of her
      ladyship's organs of speech. Or how could pretty Miss Dulcet&mdash;all
      sentiment, it is true, but all bashful timidity&mdash;appall Captain
      Smirke from proposing with, 'Did not you think the parson's sermon a
      little too dry in&mdash;MY Novel'? It will require a face of brass, or at
      least a long course of citrate of iron, before a respectable lady or
      unassuming young gentleman, with a proper dread of being taken for
      scribblers, could electrify a social circle with 'The reviewers don't do
      justice to the excellent things in&mdash;My Novel.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      CAPTAIN ROLAND.&mdash;"Awful consequences, indeed, may arise from the
      mistakes such a title gives rise to. Counsellor Digwell, for instance, a
      lawyer of literary tastes, but whose career at the Bar was long delayed by
      an unjust suspicion amongst the attorneys that he had written a
      'Philosophical Essay'&mdash;imagine such a man excusing himself for being
      late at a dinner of bigwigs, with 'I could not get away from&mdash;My
      Novel!' It would be his professional ruin! I am not fond of lawyers in
      general, but still I would not be a party to taking the bread out of the
      mouth of those with a family; and Digwell has children,&mdash;the tenth an
      innocent baby in arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"As to Digwell in particular, and lawyers in general,
      they are too accustomed to circumlocution to expose themselves to the
      danger your kind heart apprehends; but I allow that a shy scholar like
      myself, or a grave college tutor, might be a little put to the blush, if
      he were to blurt forth inadvertently with, 'Don't waste your time over
      trash like&mdash;MY Novel.' And that thought presents to us another and
      more pleasing view of this critical question. The title you condemn places
      the work under universal protection. Lives there a man or a woman so dead
      to self-love as to say, 'What contemptible stuff is&mdash;MY Novel'? Would
      he or she not rather be impelled by that strong impulse of an honourable
      and virtuous heart, which moves us to stand as well as we can with our
      friends, to say, 'Allow that there is really a good thing now and then in&mdash;My
      Novel.' Moreover, as a novel aspires to embrace most of the interests or
      the passions that agitate mankind,&mdash;to generalize, as it were, the
      details of life that come home to us all,&mdash;so, in reality, the title
      denotes that if it be such as the author may not unworthily call his
      Novel, it must also be such as the reader, whoever he be, may appropriate
      in part to himself, representing his own ideas, expressing his own
      experience, reflecting, if not in full, at least in profile, his own
      personal identity. Thus, when we glance at the looking-glass in another
      man's room, our likeness for the moment appropriates the mirror; and
      according to the humour in which we are, or the state of our spirits and
      health, we say to ourselves, 'Bilious and yellow!&mdash;I might as well
      take care of my diet!' Or, 'Well, I 've half a mind to propose to dear
      Jane; I'm not such an ill-looking dog as I thought for!' Still, whatever
      result from that glance at the mirror, we never doubt that 't is our
      likeness we see; and each says to the phantom reflection, 'Thou art
      myself,' though the mere article of furniture that gives the reflection
      belongs to another. It is my likeness if it be his glass. And a narrative
      that is true to the Varieties of Life is every Man's Novel, no matter from
      what shores, by what rivers, by what bays, in what pits, were extracted
      the sands and the silex, the pearlash, the nitre, and quicksilver which
      form its materials; no matter who the craftsman who fashioned its form; no
      matter who the vendor that sold, or the customer who bought: still, if I
      but recognize some trait of myself, 't is my likeness that makes it 'My
      Novel.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS (puzzled, and therefore admiring).&mdash;"Subtle, sir,&mdash;very
      subtle. Fine organ of Comparison in Mr. Caxton's head, and much called
      into play this evening!"

    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (benignly).&mdash;"Finally, the author by this most admirable
      and much signifying title dispenses with all necessity of preface. He need
      insinuate no merits, he need extenuate no faults; for, by calling his work
      thus curtly 'MY Novel,' he doth delicately imply that it is no use wasting
      talk about faults or merits."
    </p>
    <p>
      PISISTRATUS (amazed).&mdash;"How is that, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"What so clear? You imply that, though a better novel
      may be written by others, you do not expect to write a novel to which,
      taken as a novel, you would more decisively and unblushingly prefix that
      voucher of personal authorship and identity conveyed in the monosyllable
      'My.' And if you have written your best, let it be ever so bad, what can
      any man of candour and integrity require more from you? Perhaps you will
      say that, if you had lived two thousand years ago, you might have called
      it 'The Novel,' or the 'Golden Novel,' as Lucius called his story 'The
      Ass;' and Apuleius, to distinguish his own more elaborate Ass from all
      Asses preceding it, called his tale 'The Golden Ass.' But living in the
      present day, such a designation&mdash;implying a merit in general, not the
      partial and limited merit corresponding only with your individual
      abilities&mdash;would be presumptuous and offensive. True, I here
      anticipate the observation I see Squills is about to make&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      SQUILLS.&mdash;"I, Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"You would say that, as Scarron called his work of
      fiction 'The Comic Novel,' so Pisistratus might have called his 'The
      Serious Novel,' or 'The Tragic Novel.' But, Squills, that title would not
      have been inviting nor appropriate, and would have been exposed to
      comparison with Scarron, who being dead is inimitable. Wherefore&mdash;to
      put the question on the irrefragable basis of mathematics&mdash;wherefore
      as A B 'My Novel' is not equal to B C 'The Golden Novel,' nor to D E 'The
      Serious or Tragic Novel,' it follows that A B 'My Novel' is equal to P C
      'Pisistratus Caxton,' and P C 'Pisistratus Caxton' must therefore be just
      equal, neither more nor less, to A B 'My Novel,'&mdash;which was to be
      demonstrated." My father looked round triumphantly, and observing that
      Squills was dumfounded, and the rest of his audience posed, he added
      mildly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so now, 'non quieta movere,' proceed with the Final Chapter, and tell
      us first what became of that youthful Giles Overreach, who was himself his
      own Marrall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said the captain, "what became of Randal Leslie? Did he repent and
      reform?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," quoth my father, with a mournful shake of the head, "you can
      regulate the warm tide of wild passion, you can light into virtue the dark
      errors of ignorance; but where the force of the brain does but clog the
      free action of the heart, where you have to deal, not with ignorance
      misled, but intelligence corrupted, small hope of reform; for reform here
      will need re-organization. I have somewhere read (perhaps in Hebrew
      tradition) that of the two orders of fallen spirits,&mdash;the Angels of
      Love and the Angels of Knowledge,&mdash;the first missed the stars they
      had lost, and wandered back through the darkness, one by one, into heaven;
      but the last, lighted on by their own lurid splendours, said, 'Wherever we
      go, there is heaven!' And deeper and lower descending, lost their shape
      and their nature, till, deformed and obscene, the bottomless pit closed
      around them."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. SQUILLS.&mdash;"I should not have thought, Mr. Caxton, that a book-man
      like you would be thus severe upon Knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON (in wrath).&mdash;"Severe upon knowledge! Oh, Squills, Squills,
      Squills! Knowledge perverted is knowledge no longer. Vinegar, which,
      exposed to the sun, breeds small serpents, or at best slimy eels, not
      comestible, once was wine. If I say to my grandchildren, 'Don't drink that
      sour stuff, which the sun itself fills with reptiles,' does that prove me
      a foe to sound sherry? Squills, if you had but received a scholastic
      education, you would know the wise maxim that saith, 'All things the worst
      are corruptions from things originally designed as the best.' Has not
      freedom bred anarchy, and religion fanaticism? And if I blame Marat
      calling for blood, or Dominic racking a heretic, am I severe on the
      religion that canonized Francis de Sales, or the freedom that immortalized
      Thrasybulus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Squills, dreading a catalogue of all the saints in the calendar, and
      an epitome of Ancient History, exclaimed eagerly, "Enough, sir; I am
      convinced!"
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. CAXTON.&mdash;"Moreover, I have thought it a natural stroke of art in
      Pisistratus to keep Randal Leslie, in his progress towards the rot of the
      intellect unwholesomely refined, free from all the salutary influences
      that deter ambition from settling into egotism. Neither in his slovenly
      home, nor from his classic tutor at his preparatory school, does he seem
      to have learned any truths, religious or moral, that might give sap to
      fresh shoots, when the first rank growth was cut down by the knife; and I
      especially noted, as illustrative of Egerton, no less than of Randal, that
      though the statesman's occasional hints of advice to his protege are
      worldly wise in their way, and suggestive of honour as befitting the creed
      of a gentleman, they are not such as much influence a shrewd reasoner like
      Randal, whom the example of the playground at Eton had not served to
      correct of the arid self-seeking, which looked to knowledge for no object
      but power. A man tempted by passions like Audley, or seduced into fraud by
      a cold, subtle spirit like Leslie, will find poor defence in the elegant
      precept, 'Remember to act as a gentleman.' Such moral embroidery adds a
      beautiful scarf to one's armour; but it is not the armour itself! Ten
      o'clock, as I live! Push on, Pisistratus! and finish the chapter."
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CAXTON (benevolently).&mdash;"Don't hurry. Begin with that odious
      Randal Leslie, to oblige your father; but there are others whom Blanche
      and I care much more to hear about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pisistratus, since there is no help for it, produces a supplementary
      manuscript, which proves that, whatever his doubt as to the artistic
      effect of a Final Chapter, he had foreseen that his audience would not be
      contented without one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal Leslie, late at noon the day after he quitted Lansmere Park,
      arrived on foot at his father's house. He had walked all the way, and
      through the solitudes of the winter night; but he was not sensible of
      fatigue till the dismal home closed round him, with its air of hopeless
      ignoble poverty; and then he sunk upon the floor feeling himself a ruin
      amidst the ruins. He made no disclosure of what had passed to his
      relations. Miserable man, there was not one to whom he could confide, or
      from whom he might hear the truths that connect repentance with
      consolation! After some weeks passed in sullen and almost unbroken
      silence, be left as abruptly as he had appeared, and returned to London.
      The sudden death of a man like Egerton had even in those excited times
      created intense, though brief sensation. The particulars of the election,
      that had been given in detail in the provincial papers, were copied into
      the London journals, among those details, Randal Leslie's conduct in the
      Committee-room, with many an indignant comment on selfishness and
      ingratitude. The political world of all parties formed one of those
      judgments on the great man's poor dependant, which fix a stain upon the
      character and place a barrier in the career of ambitious youth. The
      important personages who had once noticed Randal for Audley's sake, and
      who, on their subsequent and not long-deferred restoration to power, could
      have made his fortune, passed him in the streets without a nod. He did not
      venture to remind Avenel of the promise to aid him in another election for
      Lansmere, nor dream of filling up the vacancy which Egerton's death had
      created. He was too shrewd not to see that all hope of that borough was
      over,&mdash;he would have been hooted in the streets and pelted from the
      hustings. Forlorn in the vast metropolis as Leonard had once been, in his
      turn he loitered on the bridge, and gazed on the remorseless river. He had
      neither money nor connections,&mdash;nothing save talents and knowledge to
      force his way back into the lofty world in which all had smiled on him
      before; and talents and knowledge, that had been exerted to injure a
      benefactor, made him but the more despised. But even now, Fortune, that
      had bestowed on the pauper heir of Rood advantages so numerous and so
      dazzling, out of which he had cheated himself, gave him a chance, at
      least, of present independence, by which, with patient toil, he might have
      won, if not to the highest places, at least to a position in which he
      could have forced the world to listen to his explanations; and perhaps
      receive his excuses. The L5,000 that Audley designed for him, and which,
      in a private memorandum, the statesman had entreated Harley to see safely
      rescued from the fangs of the law, were made over to Randal by Lord
      L'Estrange's solicitor; but this sum seemed to him so small after the loss
      of such gorgeous hopes, and the up-hill path seemed so slow after such
      short cuts to power, that Randal looked upon the unexpected bequest simply
      as an apology for adopting no profession. Stung to the quick by the
      contrast between his past and his present place in the English world, he
      hastened abroad. There, whether in distraction from thought, or from the
      curiosity of a restless intellect to explore the worth of things yet
      untried, Randal Leslie, who had hitherto been so dead to the ordinary
      amusements of youth, plunged into the society of damaged gamesters and
      third-rate roues. In this companionship his very talents gradually
      degenerated, and their exercise upon low intrigues and miserable projects
      but abased his social character, till, sinking step after step as his
      funds decayed, he finally vanished out of the sphere in which even
      profligates still retain the habits, and cling to the caste of gentlemen.
      His father died; the neglected property of Rood devolved on Randal, but
      out of its scanty proceeds he had to pay the portions of his brother and
      sister, and his mother's jointure; the surplus left was scarcely visible
      in the executor's account. The hope of restoring the home and fortunes of
      his forefathers had long ceased. What were the ruined hall and its bleak
      wastes, without that hope which had once dignified the wreck and the
      desert? He wrote from St. Petersburg, ordering the sale of the property.
      No one great proprietor was a candidate for the unpromising investment; it
      was sold in lots among small freeholders and retired traders. A builder
      bought the hall for its material. Hall, lands, and name were blotted out
      of the map and the history of the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow, Oliver, and Juliet removed to a provincial town in another
      shire. Juliet married an ensign in a marching regiment; and died of
      neglect after childbirth. Mrs. Leslie did not long survive her. Oliver
      added to his little fortune by marriage with the daughter of a retail
      tradesman, who had amassed a few thousand pounds. He set up a brewery, and
      contrived to live without debt, though a large family and his own
      constitutional inertness extracted from his business small profits and no
      savings. Nothing of Randal had been heard of for years after the sale of
      Rood, except that he had taken up his residence either in Australia or the
      United States; it was not known which, but presumed to be the latter.
      Still, Oliver had been brought up with so high a veneration of his
      brother's talents, that he cherished the sanguine belief that Randal would
      some day appear, wealthy and potent, like the uncle in a comedy; lift rip
      the sunken family, and rear into graceful ladies and accomplished
      gentlemen the clumsy little boys and the vulgar little girls who now
      crowded round Oliver's dinner-table, with appetites altogether
      disproportioned to the size of the joints.
    </p>
    <p>
      One winter day, when from the said dinner-table wife and children had
      retired, and Oliver sat sipping his half-pint of bad port, and looking
      over unsatisfactory accounts, a thin terrier, lying on the threadbare rug
      by the niggard fire, sprang up and barked fiercely. Oliver lifted his dull
      blue eyes, and saw opposite to him, at the window, a human face. The face
      was pressed close to the panes, and was obscured by the haze which the
      breath of its lips drew forth from the frosty rime that had gathered on
      the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, alarmed and indignant, supposing this intrusive spectator of his
      privacy to be some bold and lawless tramper, stepped out of the room,
      opened the front door, and bade the stranger go about his business; while
      the terrier still more inhospitably yelped and snapped at the stranger's
      heels. Then a hoarse voice said, "Don't you know me, Oliver? I am your
      brother Randal! Call away your dog and let me in." Oliver stared aghast;
      he could not believe his slow senses, he could not recognize his brother
      in the gaunt grim apparition before him; but at length he came forward,
      gazed into Randal's face, and, grasping his hand in amazed silence, led
      him into the little parlour. Not a trace of the well-bred refinement which
      had once characterized Randal's air and person was visible. His dress
      bespoke the last stage of that terrible decay which is significantly
      called the "shabby genteel." His mien was that of the skulking, timorous,
      famished vagabond. As he took off his greasy tattered hat, he exhibited,
      though still young in years, the signs of premature old age. His hair,
      once so fine and silken, was of a harsh iron-gray, bald in ragged patches;
      his forehead and visage were ploughed into furrows; intelligence was still
      in the aspect, but an intelligence that instinctively set you on your
      guard,&mdash;sinister, gloomy, menacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randal stopped short all questioning. He seized the small modicum of wine
      on the table, and drained it at a draught. "Poole," said he, "have you
      nothing that warms a man better than this?" Oliver, who felt as if under
      the influence of a frightful dream, went to a cupboard and took out a
      bottle of brandy three-parts full. Randal snatched at it eagerly, and put
      his lips to the mouth of the bottle. "Ah," said he, after a short pause,
      "this comforts; now give me food." Oliver hastened himself to serve his
      brother; in fact, he felt ashamed that even the slipshod maid-servant
      should see his visitor. When he returned with such provisions as he could
      extract from the larder, Randal was seated by the fire, spreading over the
      embers emaciated bony hands, like the talons of a vulture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He devoured the cold meat set before him with terrible voracity, and
      nearly finished the spirits left in the bottle; but the last had no effect
      in dispersing his gloom. Oliver stared at him in fear; the terrier
      continued to utter a low suspicious growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would know my history?" at length said Randal, bluntly. "It is short.
      I have tried for fortune and failed, I am without a penny and without a
      hope. You seem poor,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you cannot much help me. Let me at least stay with you for a
      time,&mdash;I know not where else to look for bread and for shelter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver burst into tears, and cordially bade his brother welcome. Randal
      remained some weeks at Oliver's house, never stirring out of the doors,
      and not seeming to notice, though he did not scruple to use, the new
      habiliments, which Oliver procured ready-made, and placed, without remark,
      in his room. But his presence soon became intolerable to the mistress of
      the house, and oppressive even to its master. Randal, who had once been so
      abstemious that he had even regarded the most moderate use of wine as
      incompatible with clear judgment and vigilant observation, had contracted
      the habit of drinking spirits at all hours of the day; but though they
      sometimes intoxicated him into stupor, they never unlocked his heart nor
      enlivened his sullen mood. If he observed less acutely than of old, he
      could still conceal just as closely. Mrs. Oliver Leslie, at first rather
      awed and taciturn, grew cold and repelling, then pert and sarcastic, at
      last undisguisedly and vulgarly rude. Randal made no retort; but his sneer
      was so galling that the wife flew at once to her husband, and declared
      that either she or his brother must leave the house. Oliver tried to
      pacify and compromise, with partial success; and a few days afterwards, he
      came to Randal and said timidly, "You see, my wife brought me nearly all I
      possess, and you don't condescend to make friends with her. Your residence
      here must be as painful to you as to me. But I wish to see you provided
      for; and I could offer you something, only it seems, at first glance, so
      beneath&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beneath what?" interrupted Randal, witheringly. "What I was&mdash;or what
      I am? Speak out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure you are a scholar; and I have heard you say fine things about
      knowledge and so forth; and you'll have plenty of books at your disposal,
      no doubt; and you are still young, and may rise&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hell and torments! Be quick,&mdash;say the worst or the best!" cried
      Randal, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then," said poor Oliver, still trying to soften the intended
      proposal, "you must know that our poor sister's husband was nephew to Dr.
      Felpem, who keeps a very respectable school. He is not learned himself,
      and attends chiefly to arithmetic and book-keeping, and such matters; but
      he wants an usher to teach the classics, for some of the boys go to
      college. And I have written to him, just to sound&mdash;I did not mention
      your name till I knew if you would like it; but he will take my
      recommendation. Board, lodging, L50 a year; in short, the place is yours
      if you like it." Randal shivered from head to foot, and was long before he
      answered. "Well, be it so; I have come to that. Ha, ha! yes, knowledge is
      power!" He paused a few moments. "So, the old Hall is razed to the ground,
      and you are a tradesman in a small country town, and my sister is dead,
      and I henceforth am&mdash;John Smith! You say that you did not mention my
      name to the schoolmaster,&mdash;still keep it concealed; forget that I
      once was a Leslie. Our tie of brotherhood ceases when I go from your
      hearth. Write, then, to your head-master, who attends to arithmetic, and
      secure the rank of his usher in Latin and Greek for&mdash;John Smith!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many days afterwards, the protege of Audley Egerton entered on his
      duties as usher in one of those large, cheap schools, which comprise a
      sprinkling of the sons of gentry and clergymen designed for the learned
      professions, with a far larger proportion of the sons of traders,
      intended, some for the counting-house, some for the shop and the till.
      There, to this day, under the name of John Smith, lives Randal Leslie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probably not pride alone that induces him to persist in that change
      of name, and makes him regard as perpetual the abandonment of the one that
      he took from his forefathers, and with which he had once identified his
      vaulting ambition; for shortly after he had quitted his brother's house,
      Oliver read in the weekly newspaper, to which he bounded his lore of the
      times in which he lived, an extract from an American journal, wherein
      certain mention was made of an English adventurer who, amongst other
      aliases, had assumed the name of Leslie,&mdash;that extract caused Oliver
      to start, turn pale, look round, and thrust the paper into the fire. From
      that time he never attempted to violate the condition Randal had imposed
      on him, never sought to renew their intercourse, nor to claim a brother.
      Doubtless, if the adventurer thus signalized was the man Oliver suspected,
      whatever might be imputed to Randal's charge that could have paled a
      brother's cheek, it was none of the more violent crimes to which law is
      inexorable, but rather (in that progress made by ingratitude and
      duplicity, with Need and Necessity urging them on) some act of dishonesty
      which may just escape from the law, to sink, without redemption, the name.
      However this be, there is nothing in Randal's present course of life which
      forbodes any deeper fall. He has known what it is to want bread, and his
      former restlessness subsides into cynic apathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lodges in the town near the school, and thus the debasing habit of
      unsocial besotment is not brought under the eyes of his superior. The
      drain is his sole luxury; if it be suspected, it is thought to be his sole
      vice. He goes through the ordinary routine of tuition with average credit;
      his spirit of intrigue occasionally shows itself in attempts to conciliate
      the favour of the boys whose fathers are wealthy, who are born to higher
      rank than the rest; and he lays complicated schemes to be asked home for
      the holidays. But when the schemes succeed, and the invitation comes, he
      recoils and shrinks back,&mdash;he does not dare to show himself on the
      borders of the brighter world he once hoped to sway; he fears that he may
      be discovered to be&mdash;a Leslie! On such days, when his taskwork is
      over, he shuts himself up in his room, locks the door, and drugs himself
      into insensibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he found a well-worn volume running the round of delighted
      schoolboys, took it up, and recognized Leonard's earliest popular work,
      which had, many years before, seduced himself into pleasant thoughts and
      gentle emotions. He carried the book to his own lodgings, read it again;
      and when he returned it to its young owner, some of the leaves were
      stained with tears. Alas! perhaps but the maudlin tears of broken nerves,
      not of the awakened soul,&mdash;for the leaves smelt strongly of whiskey.
      Yet, after that re-perusal, Randal Leslie turned suddenly to deeper
      studies than his habitual drudgeries required. He revived and increased
      his early scholarship; he chalked the outline of a work of great
      erudition, in which the subtlety of his intellect found field in learned
      and acute criticism. But he has never proceeded far in this work. After
      each irregular and spasmodic effort, the pen drops from his hand, and he
      mutters, "But to what end?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can never now raise a name. Why give reputation to&mdash;John Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he drags on his life; and perhaps, when he dies, the fragments of his
      learned work may be discovered in the desk of the usher, and serve as
      hints to some crafty student, who may filch ideas and repute from the dead
      Leslie, as Leslie had filched them from the living Burley.
    </p>
    <p>
      While what may be called poetical justice has thus evolved itself from the
      schemes in which Randal Leslie had wasted rare intellect in baffling his
      own fortunes, no outward signs of adversity evince the punishment of
      Providence on the head of the more powerful offender, Baron Levy. No fall
      in the Funds has shaken the sumptuous fabric, built from the ruined houses
      of other men. Baron Levy is still Baron Levy the millionaire; but I doubt
      if at heart he be not more acutely miserable than Randal Leslie the usher.
      For Levy is a man who has admitted the fiercer passions into his
      philosophy of life; he has not the pale blood and torpid heart which allow
      the scotched adder to dose away its sense of pain. Just as old age began
      to creep upon the fashionable usurer, he fell in love with a young
      opera-dancer, whose light heels had turned the lighter heads of half the
      eligans of Paris and London. The craft of the dancer was proof against all
      lesser bribes than that of marriage; and Levy married her. From that
      moment his house, Louis Quinze, was more crowded than ever by the
      high-born dandies whose society he had long so eagerly courted. That
      society became his curse. The baroness was an accomplished coquette; and
      Levy (with whom, as we have seen, jealousy was the predominant passion)
      was stretched on an eternal rack. His low estimate of human nature, his
      disbelief in the possibility of virtue, added strength to the agony of his
      suspicions, and provoked the very dangers he dreaded. His self-torturing
      task was that of the spy upon his own hearth. His banquets were haunted by
      a spectre; the attributes of his wealth were as the goad and the scourge
      of Nemesis. His gay cynic smile changed into a sullen scowl, his hair
      blanched into white, his eyes were hollow with one consuming care.
      Suddenly he left his costly house,&mdash;left London; abjured all the
      society which it had been the joy of his wealth to purchase; buried
      himself and his wife in a remote corner of the provinces; and there he
      still lives. He seeks in vain to occupy his days with rural pursuits,&mdash;he
      to whom the excitements of a metropolis, with all its corruption and its
      vices, were the sole sources of the torpid stream that he called
      "pleasure." There, too, the fiend of jealousy still pursues him: he prowls
      round his demesnes with the haggard eye and furtive step of a thief; he
      guards his wife as a prisoner, for she threatens every day to escape. The
      life of the man who had opened the prison to so many is the life of a
      jailer. His wife abhors him, and does not conceal it; and still slavishly
      he dotes on her. Accustomed to the freest liberty, demanding applause and
      admiration as her rights; wholly uneducated, vulgar in mind, coarse in
      language, violent in temper, the beautiful Fury he had brought to his home
      makes that home a hell. Thus, what might seem to the superficial most
      enviable, is to their possessor most hateful. He dares not ask a soul to
      see how he spends his gold; he has shrunk into a mean and niggardly
      expenditure, and complains of reverse and poverty, in order to excuse
      himself to his wife for debarring her the enjoyments which she anticipated
      from the Money Bags she had married. A vague consciousness of retribution
      has awakened remorse, to add to his other stings. And the remorse coming
      from superstition, not religion (sent from below, not descending from
      above), brings with it none of the consolations of a genuine repentance.
      He never seeks to atone, never dreams of some redeeming good action. His
      riches flow around him, spreading wider and wider&mdash;out of his own
      reach.

      The Count di Peschiera was not deceived in the calculations which had
      induced him to affect repentance, and establish a claim upon his kinsman.
      He received from the generosity of the Duke di Serrano an annuity not
      disproportioned to his rank, and no order from his court forbade his
      return to Vienna. But, in the very summer that followed his visit to
      Lansmere, his career came to an abrupt close. At Baden-Baden he paid court
      to a wealthy and accomplished Polish widow; and his fine person and
      terrible repute awed away all rivals, save a young Frenchman, as daring as
      himself, and much more in love. A challenge was given and accepted.
      Peschiera appeared on the fatal ground, with his customary sang-froid,
      humming an opera air, and looking so diabolically gay that his opponent's
      nerves were affected in spite of his courage; and the Frenchman's trigger
      going off before he had even taken aim, to his own ineffable astonishment,
      he shot the count through the heart, dead.

      Beatrice di Negra lived for some years after her brother's death in strict
      seclusion, lodging within a convent, though she did not take the veil, as
      she at first proposed. In fact, the more she saw of the sisterhood, the
      more she found that human regrets and human passions (save in some rarely
      gifted natures) find their way through the barred gates and over the lofty
      walls. Finally, she took up her abode in Rome, where she is esteemed for a
      life not only marked by strict propriety, but active benevolence. She
      cannot be prevailed on to accept from the duke more than a fourth of the
      annuity that had been bestowed on her brother; but she has few wants, save
      those of charity; and when charity is really active, it can do so much
      with so little gold! She is not known in the gayer circles of the city;
      but she gathers round her a small society composed chiefly of artists and
      scholars, and is never so happy as when she can aid some child of genius,&mdash;more
      especially if his country be England.

      The squire and his wife still flourish at Hazeldean, where Captain
      Barnabas Higginbotham has taken up his permanent abode. The captain is a
      confirmed hypochondriac; but he brightens up now and then when he hears of
      any illness in the family of Mr. Sharpe Currie, and, at such times, is
      heard to murmur, "If those seven sickly children should go off, I might
      still have very great&mdash;EXPECTATIONS,"&mdash;for the which he has been
      roundly scolded by the squire, and gravely preached at by the parson. Upon
      both, however, he takes his revenge in a fair and gentlemanlike way, three
      times a week, at the whist-table, the parson no longer having the captain
      as his constant partner, since a fifth now generally cuts in at the table,&mdash;in
      the person of that old enemy and neighbour, Mr. Sticktorights. The parson,
      thus fighting his own battles unallied to the captain, observes with
      melancholy surprise that there is a long run of luck against him, and that
      he does not win so much as he used to do. Fortunately that is the sole
      trouble&mdash;except Mrs. Dale's "little tempers," to which he is
      accustomed&mdash;that ever disturbs the serene tenor of the parson's life.
      We must now explain how Mr. Sticktorights came to cut in at the Hazeldean
      whist-table. Frank has settled at the Casino with a wife who suits him
      exactly, and that wife was Miss Sticktorights. It was two years before
      Frank recovered the disappointment with which the loss of Beatrice
      saddened his spirits, but sobered his habits and awoke his reflection. An
      affection, however misplaced and ill-requited, if honestly conceived and
      deeply felt, rarely fails to advance the self-education of man. Frank
      became steady and serious; and, on a visit to Hazeldean, met at a county
      ball Miss Sticktorights, and the two young persons were instantly
      attracted towards each other, perhaps by the very feud that had so long
      existed between their houses. The marriage settlements were nearly
      abandoned, at the last moment, by a discussion between the parents as to
      the Right of Way; but the dispute was happily appeased by Mr. Dale's
      suggestion that as both properties would be united in the children of the
      proposed marriage, all cause for litigation would naturally cease, since
      no man would go to law with himself. Mr. Sticktorights and Mr. Hazeldean,
      however, agreed in the precaution of inserting a clause in the settlements
      (though all the lawyers declared that it could not be of any legal avail),
      by which it was declared, that if, in default of heritable issue by the
      said marriage, the Sticktorights' estate devolved on some distant scion of
      the Sticktorights family, the right of way from the wood across the waste
      land would still remain in the same state of delectable dispute in which
      it then stood. There seems, however, little chance of a lawsuit thus
      providently bequeathed to the misery of distant generations, since two
      sons and two daughters are already playing at hide-and-seek on the terrace
      where Jackeymo once watered the orange-trees, and in the belvidere where
      Riccabocca had studied his Machiavelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackeymo, though his master has assessed the long arrears of his wages at
      a sum which would enable him to have orange-groves and servants of his
      own, still clings to his former duties, and practises his constitutional
      parsimony. His only apparent deviation into profusion consists in the
      erection of a chapel to his sainted namesake, to whom he burns many a
      votive taper,&mdash;the tapers are especially tall, and their sconces are
      wreathed with garlands, whenever a letter with the foreign postmark brings
      good news of the absent Violante and her English lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riccabocca was long before he reconciled himself to the pomp of his
      principalities and his title of Duke. Jemima accommodated herself much
      more readily to greatness; but she retained all her native Hazeldean
      simplicity at heart, and is adored by the villagers around her, especially
      by the young of both sexes, whom she is always ready to marry and to
      portion,&mdash;convinced, long ere this, of the redeemable qualities of
      the male sex by her reverence for the duke, who continues to satirize
      women and wedlock, and deem himself&mdash;thanks to his profound
      experience of the one, and his philosophical endurance of the other&mdash;the
      only happy husband in the world. Longer still was it before the sage, who
      had been so wisely anxious to rid himself of the charge of a daughter,
      could wean his thoughts from the remembrance of her tender voice and
      loving eyes,&mdash;not, indeed, till he seriously betook himself to the
      task of educating the son with whom, according to his scientific
      prognostics, Jemima presented him shortly after his return to his native
      land. The sage began betimes with his Italian proverbs, full of
      hardhearted worldly wisdom, and the boy was scarce out of the hornbook
      before he was introduced to Machiavelli. But somehow or other the simple
      goodness of the philosopher's actual life, with his high-wrought patrician
      sentiments of integrity and honour, so counteract the theoretical lessons,
      that the Heir of Serrano is little likely to be made more wise by the
      proverbs, or more wicked by the Machiavelli, than those studies have
      practically made the progenitor, whose opinions his countrymen still shame
      with the title of "Alphonso the Good."

      The duke long cherished a strong curiosity to know what had become of
      Randal. He never traced the adventurer to his closing scene. But once
      (years before Randal had crept into his present shelter) in a visit of
      inspection to the hospital at Genoa, the duke, with his peculiar
      shrewdness of observation in all matters except those which concerned
      himself, was remarking to the officer in attendance, "that for one dull,
      honest man whom fortune drove to the hospital or the jail, he had found,
      on investigation of their antecedents, three sharp-witted knaves who had
      thereto reduced themselves"&mdash;when his eye fell upon a man asleep in
      one of the sick wards; and recognizing the face, not then so changed as
      Oliver had seen it, he walked straight up, and gazed upon Randal Leslie.

      "An Englishman," said the official. "He was brought hither insensible,
      from a severe wound on the head, inflicted, as we discovered, by a
      well-known chevalier d'industrie, who declared that the Englishman had
      outwitted and cheated him. That was not very likely, for a few crowns were
      all we could find on the Englishman's person, and he had been obliged to
      leave his lodgings for debt. He is recovering, but there is fever still."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke gazed silently on the sleeper, who was tossing restlessly on his
      pallet, and muttering to himself; then he placed his purse in the
      official's hand. "Give this to the Englishman," said he; "but conceal my
      name. It is true, it is true, the proverb is very true," resumed the duke,
      descending the stairs, "Piu pelli di volpi the di asini vanno in
      Pellieciaria." (More hides of foxes than of asses find their way to the
      tanner's).

      Dr. Morgan continues to prescribe globules for grief, and to administer
      infinitesimally to a mind diseased. Practising what he prescribes, he
      swallows a globule of caustic whenever the sight of a distressed
      fellow-creature moves him to compassion,&mdash;a constitutional tendency
      which, he is at last convinced, admits of no radical cure. For the rest,
      his range of patients has notably expanded; and under his sage care his
      patients unquestionably live as long&mdash;as Providence pleases. No
      allopathist can say more.

      The death of poor John Burley found due place in the obituary of "literary
      men." Admirers, unknown before, came forward and subscribed for a handsome
      monument to his memory in Kensall Green. They would have subscribed for
      the relief of his widow and children, if he had left any. Writers in
      magazines thrived for some months on collections of his humorous sayings,
      anecdotes of his eccentricities, and specimens of the eloquence that had
      lightened through the tobacco-reek of tavern and club-room. Leonard
      ultimately made a selection from his scattered writings which found place
      in standard libraries, though their subjects were either of too fugitive
      an interest, or treated in too capricious a manner, to do more than
      indicate the value of the ore, had it been purified from its dross and
      subjected to the art of the mint. These specimens could not maintain their
      circulation as the coined money of Thought, but they were hoarded by
      collectors as rare curiosities. Alas, poor Burley!

      The Pompleys sustained a pecuniary loss by the crash of a railway company,
      in which the colonel had been induced to take several shares by one of his
      wife's most boasted "connections," whose estate the said railway proposed
      to traverse, on paying L400 an acre, in that golden age when railway
      companies respected the rights of property. The colonel was no longer
      able, in his own country, to make both ends meet at Christmas. He is now
      straining hard to achieve that feat in Boulogne, and has in the process
      grown so red in the face, that those who meet him in his morning walk on
      the pier, bargaining for fish, shake their heads and say, "Old Pompley
      will go off in a fit of apoplexy; a great loss to society; genteel people
      the Pompleys! and very highly 'connected.'"

      The vacancy created in the borough of Lansmere by Audley Egerton's death
      was filled up by our old acquaintance, Haveril Dashmore, who had
      unsuccessfully contested that seat on Egerton's first election. The naval
      officer was now an admiral, and perfectly reconciled to the Constitution,
      with all its alloy of aristocracy.

      Dick Avenel did not retire from parliament so soon as he had anticipated.
      He was not able to persuade Leonard, whose brief fever of political
      ambition was now quenched in the calm fountain of the Muse, to supply his
      place in the senate, and he felt that the House of Avenel needed one
      representative. He contrived, however, to devote, for the first year or
      two, much more of his time to his interests at Screwstown than to the
      affairs of his country, and succeeded in baffling the over-competition to
      which he had been subjected by taking the competitor into partnership.
      Having thus secured a monopoly at Screwstown, Dick, of course, returned
      with great ardour to his former enlightened opinions in favour of free
      trade. He remained some years in parliament; and though far too shrewd to
      venture out of his depth as an orator, distinguished himself so much by
      his exposure of "humbug" on an important Committee, that he acquired a
      very high reputation as a man of business, and gradually became so in
      request amongst all the members who moved for "Select Committees," that he
      rose into consequence; and Mrs. Avenel, courted for his sake, more than
      her own, obtained the wish of her heart, and was received as an
      acknowledged habituee into the circles of fashion. Amidst these circles,
      however, Dick found that his home entirely vanished; and when he came home
      from the House of Commons, tired to death, at two in the morning,
      disgusted at always hearing that Mrs. Avenel was not yet returned from
      some fine lady's ball, he formed a sudden resolution of cutting
      Parliament, Fashion, and London altogether; withdrew his capital, now very
      large, from his business; bought the remaining estates of Squire
      Thornhill; and his chief object of ambition is in endeavouring to coax or
      bully out of their holdings all the small freeholders round, who had
      subdivided amongst them, into poles and furlongs, the fated inheritance of
      Randal Leslie. An excellent justice of the peace, though more severe than
      your old family proprietors generally are; a spirited landlord, as to
      encouraging and making, at a proper percentage, all permanent improvements
      on the soil, but formidable to meet if the rent be not paid to the day, or
      the least breach of covenant be heedlessly incurred on a farm that he
      could let for more money; employing a great many hands in productive
      labour, but exacting rigorously from all the utmost degree of work at the
      smallest rate of wages which competition and the poor-rate permit; the
      young and robust in his neighbourhood never stinted in work, and the aged
      and infirm, as lumber worn out, stowed away in the workhouse,&mdash;Richard
      Avenel holds himself an example to the old race of landlords; and, taken
      altogether, he is no very bad specimen of the rural civilizers whom the
      application of spirit and capital raise up in the new.

      From the wrecks of Egerton's fortune, Harley, with the aid of his father's
      experience in business, could not succeed in saving, for the statesman's
      sole child and heir, more than a few thousand pounds; and but for the
      bonds and bills which, when meditating revenge, he had bought from Levy,
      and afterwards thrown into the fire&mdash;paying dear for that detestable
      whistle&mdash;even this surplus would not have been forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley privately paid out of his own fortune the L5,000 Egerton had
      bequeathed to Leslie; perhaps not sorry, now that the stern duty of
      exposing the false wiles of the schemer was fulfilled, to afford some
      compensation even to the victim who had so richly deserved his fate; and
      pleased, though mournfully, to comply with the solemn request of the
      friend whose offence was forgotten in the remorseful memory of his own
      projects of revenge.

      Leonard's birth and identity were easily proved, and no one appeared to
      dispute them. The balance due to him as his father's heir, together with
      the sum Avenel ultimately paid to him for the patent of his invention, and
      the dowry which Harley insisted upon bestowing on Helen, amounted to that
      happy competence which escapes alike the anxieties of poverty, and (what
      to one of contemplative tastes and retired habits are often more irksome
      to bear) the show and responsibilities of wealth. His father's death made
      a deep impression upon Leonard's mind; but the discovery that he owed his
      birth to a statesman of so great a repute, and occupying a position in
      society so conspicuous, contributed not to confirm, but to still, the
      ambition which had for a short time diverted him from his more serene
      aspirations. He had no longer to win a rank which might equal Helen's. He
      had no longer a parent, whose affections might be best won through pride.
      The memories of his earlier peasant life, and his love for retirement,&mdash;in
      which habit confirmed the constitutional tendency,&mdash;made him shrink
      from what a more worldly nature would have considered the enviable
      advantages of a name that secured the entrance into the loftiest sphere of
      our social world. He wanted not that name to assist his own path to a rank
      far more durable than that which kings can confer. And still he retained
      in the works he had published, and still he proposed to bestow on the
      works more ambitious that he had, in leisure and competence, the
      facilities to design with care, and complete with patience, the name he
      had himself invented, and linked with the memory of the low-born mother.
      Therefore, though there was some wonder, in drawing-rooms and clubs, at
      the news of Egerton's first unacknowledged marriage, and some curiosity
      expressed as to what the son of that marriage might do,&mdash;and great
      men were prepared to welcome, and fine ladies to invite and bring out, the
      heir to the statesman's grave repute,&mdash;yet wonder and curiosity soon
      died away; the repute soon passed out of date, and its heir was soon
      forgotten. Politicians who fall short of the highest renown are like
      actors; no applause is so vivid while they are on the stage, no oblivion
      so complete when the curtain falls on the last farewell.

      Leonard saw a fair tomb rise above Nora's grave, and on the tomb was
      engraved the word of WIFE, which vindicated her beloved memory. He felt
      the warm embrace of Nora's mother, no longer ashamed to own her
      grandchild; and even old John was made sensible that a secret weight of
      sorrow was taken from his wife's stern silent heart. Leaning on Leonard's
      arm, the old man gazed wistfully on Nora's tomb, and muttering, "Egerton!
      Egerton! 'Leonora, the first wife of the Right Honourable Audley Egerton!'
      Ha! I voted for him. She married the right colour. Is that the date? Is it
      so long since she died? Well, well! I miss her sadly. But wife says we
      shall both now see her soon; and wife once thought we should never see her
      again,&mdash;never; but I always knew better. Thank you, sir. I'm a poor
      creature, but these tears don't pain me,&mdash;quite otherwise. I don't
      know why, but I'm very happy. Where's my old woman? She does not mind how
      much I talk about Nora now. Oh, there she is! Thank you, sir, humbly; but
      I'd rather lean on my old woman,&mdash;I'm more used to it; and&mdash;wife,
      when shall we go to Nora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard had brought Mrs. Fairfield to see her parents, and Mrs. Avenel
      welcomed her with unlooked-for kindness. The name inscribed upon Nora's
      tomb softened the mother's heart to her surviving daughter. As poor John
      had said, "She could now talk about Nora;" and in that talk, she and the
      child she had so long neglected discovered how much they had in common. So
      when, shortly after his marriage with Helen, Leonard went abroad, Jane
      Fairfield remained with the old couple. After their death, which was
      within a day of each other, she refused, perhaps from pride, to take up
      her residence with Leonard; but she settled near the home which he
      subsequently found in England. Leonard remained abroad for some years. A
      quiet observer of the various manners and intellectual development of
      living races, a rapt and musing student of the monuments that revive the
      dead, his experience of mankind grew large in silence, and his perceptions
      of the Sublime and Beautiful brightened into tranquil art under their
      native skies.
    </p>

      On his return to England he purchased a small house amidst the most
      beautiful scenes of Devonshire, and there patiently commenced a work in
      which he designed to bequeath to his country his noblest thoughts in their
      fairest forms. Some men best develop their ideas by constant exercise;
      their thoughts spring from their brain ready-armed, and seek, like the
      fabled goddess, to take constant part in the wars of men. And such are,
      perhaps, on the whole, the most vigorous and lofty writers; but Leonard
      did not belong to this class. Sweetness and serenity were the main
      characteristics of his genius; and these were deepened by his profound
      sense of his domestic happiness. To wander alone with Helen by the banks
      of the murmurous river; to gaze with her on the deep still sea; to feel
      that his thoughts, even when most silent, were comprehended by the
      intuition of love, and reflected on that translucent sympathy so yearned
      for and so rarely found by poets,&mdash;these were the Sabbaths of his
      soul, necessary to fit him for its labours: for the Writer has this
      advantage over other men, that his repose is not indolence. His duties,
      rightly fulfilled, are discharged to earth and men in other capacities
      than those of action. If he is not seen among those who act, he is all the
      while maturing some noiseless influence, which will guide or illumine,
      civilize or elevate, the restless men whose noblest actions are but the
      obedient agencies of the thoughts of writers. Call not, then, the Poet
      whom we place amidst the Varieties of Life, the sybarite of literary ease,
      if, returning on Summer eves, Helen's light footstep by his musing side,
      he greets his sequestered home, with its trellised flowers smiling out
      from amidst the lonely cliffs in which it is embedded; while lovers still,
      though wedded long, they turn to each other, with such deep joy in their
      speaking eyes, grateful that the world, with its various distractions and
      noisy conflicts, lies so far from their actual existence,&mdash;only
      united to them by the happy link that the writer weaves invisibly with the
      hearts that he moves and the souls that he inspires. No! Character and
      circumstance alike unfitted Leonard for the strife of the thronged
      literary democracy; they led towards the development of the gentler and
      purer portions of his nature,&mdash;to the gradual suppression of the more
      combative and turbulent. The influence of the happy light under which his
      genius so silently and calmly grew, was seen in the exquisite harmony of
      its colours, rather than the gorgeous diversities of their glow. His
      contemplation, intent upon objects of peaceful beauty, and undisturbed by
      rude anxieties and vehement passions, suggested only kindred reproductions
      to the creative faculty by which it was vivified; so that the whole man
      was not only a poet, but, as it were, a poem,&mdash;a living idyl, calling
      into pastoral music every reed that sighed and trembled along the stream
      of life. And Helen was so suited to a nature of this kind, she so guarded
      the ideal existence in which it breathes! All the little cares and
      troubles of the common practical life she appropriated so quietly to
      herself,&mdash;the stronger of the two, as should be a poet's wife, in the
      necessary household virtues of prudence and forethought. Thus if the man's
      genius made the home a temple, the woman's wisdom gave to the temple the
      security of the fortress. They have only one child,&mdash;a girl; they
      call her Nora. She has the father's soul-lit eyes, and the mother's warm
      human smile. She assists Helen in the morning's noiseless domestic duties;
      she sits in the evening at Leonard's feet, while he reads or writes. In
      each light grief of childhood she steals to the mother's knee; but in each
      young impulse of delight, or each brighter flash of progressive reason,
      she springs to the father's breast. Sweet Helen, thou hast taught her
      this, taking to thyself the shadows even of thine infant's life, and
      leaving to thy partner's eyes only its rosy light!
    </p>
    <p>
      But not here shall this picture of Helen close. Even the Ideal can only
      complete its purpose by connection with the Real; even in solitude the
      writer must depend upon mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leonard at last has completed the work, which has been the joy and the
      labour of so many years,&mdash;the work which he regards as the flower of
      all his spiritual being, and to which he has committed all the hopes that
      unite the creature of today with the generations of the future. The work
      has gone through the press, each line lingered over with the elaborate
      patience of the artist, loath to part with the thought he has sculptured
      into form, while an improving touch can be imparted by the chisel. He has
      accepted an invitation from Norreys. In the restless excitement (strange
      to him since his first happy maiden effort) he has gone to London.
      Unrecognized in the huge metropolis, he has watched to see if the world
      acknowledge the new tie he has woven between its busy life and his
      secluded toil. And the work came out in an unpropitious hour; other things
      were occupying the public; the world was not at leisure to heed him, and
      the book did not penetrate into the great circle of readers. But a savage
      critic has seized on it, and mangled, distorted, deformed it, confounding
      together defect and beauty in one mocking ridicule; and the beauties have
      not yet found an exponent, nor the defects a defender; and the publisher
      shakes his head, points to groaning shelves, and delicately hints that the
      work which was to be the epitome of the sacred life within life does not
      hit the taste of the day. Leonard thinks over the years that his still
      labour has cost him, and knows that he has exhausted the richest mines of
      his intellect, and that long years will elapse before he can recruit that
      capital of ideas which is necessary to sink new shafts and bring to light
      fresh ore; and the deep despondency of intellect, frustrated in its
      highest aims, has seized him, and all he has before done is involved in
      failure by the defeat of the crowning effort. Failure, and irrecoverable,
      seems his whole ambition as writer; his whole existence in the fair Ideal
      seems to have been a profitless dream, and the face of the Ideal itself is
      obscured. And even Norreys frankly, though kindly, intimates that the life
      of a metropolis is essential to the healthful intuition of a writer in the
      intellectual wants of his age, since every great writer supplies a want in
      his own generation, for some feeling to be announced, some truth to be
      revealed. And as this maxim is generally sound, as most great writers have
      lived in cities, Leonard dares not dwell on the exception; it is only
      success that justifies the attempt to be an exception to the common rule;
      and with the blunt manhood of his nature, which is not a poet's, Norreys
      sums up with, "What then? One experiment has failed; fit your life to your
      genius, and try again." Try again! Easy counsel enough to the man of ready
      resource and quick combative mind; but to Leonard, how hard and how harsh!
      "Fit his life to his genius!"&mdash;renounce contemplation and Nature for
      the jostle of Oxford Street! Would that life not scare away the genius
      forever? Perplexed and despondent, though still struggling for fortitude,
      he returns to his home; and there at his hearth awaits the Soother, and
      there is the voice that repeats the passages most beloved, and prophesies
      so confidently of future fame; and gradually all around smiles from the
      smile of Helen. And the profound conviction that Heaven places human
      happiness beyond the reach of the world's contempt or praise, circulates
      through his system and restores its serene calm. And he feels that the
      duty of the intellect is to accomplish and perfect itself,&mdash;to
      harmonize its sounds into music that may be heard in heaven, though it
      wake not an echo on the earth. If this be done, as with some men, best
      amidst the din and the discord, be it so; if, as with him, best in
      silence, be it so too. And the next day he reclines with Helen by the
      seashore, gazing calmly as before on the measureless sunlit ocean; and
      Helen, looking into his face, sees that it is sunlit as the deep. His hand
      steals within her own, in the gratitude that endears beyond the power of
      passion, and he murmurs gently, "Blessed be the woman who consoles."
    </p>
    <p>
      The work found its way at length into fame, and the fame sent its voices
      loud to the poet's home. But the applause of the world had not a sound so
      sweet to his ear, as, when, in doubt, humiliation, and sadness, the lips
      of his Helen had whispered "Hope! and believe!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side with this picture of Woman the Consoler, let me place the
      companion sketch. Harley L'Estrange, shortly after his marriage with
      Violante, had been induced, whether at his bride's persuasions, or to
      dissipate the shadow with which Egerton's death still clouded his wedded
      felicity, to accept a temporary mission, half military, half civil, to one
      of our colonies. On this mission he had evinced so much ability and
      achieved so signal a success, that on his return to England he was raised
      to the peerage, while his father yet lived to rejoice that the son who
      would succeed to his honours had achieved the nobler dignity of honours
      not inherited, but won. High expectations were formed of Harley's
      parliamentary success; but he saw that such success, to be durable, must
      found itself on the knowledge of wearisome details, and the study of that
      practical business which jarred on his tastes, though it suited his
      talents. Harley had been indolent for so many years,&mdash;and there is so
      much to make indolence captivating to a man whose rank is secured, who has
      nothing to ask from fortune, and who finds at his home no cares from which
      he seeks a distraction; so he laughed at ambition in the whim of his
      delightful humours, and the expectations formed from his diplomatic
      triumph died away. But then came one of those political crises, in which
      men ordinarily indifferent to politics rouse themselves to the
      recollection that the experiment of legislation is not made upon dead
      matter, but on the living form of a noble country; and in both Houses of
      Parliament the strength of party is put forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a lovely day in spring, and Harley is seated by the window of his
      old room at Knightsbridge,&mdash;now glancing to the lively green of the
      budding trees; now idling with Nero, who, though in canine old age, enjoys
      the sun like his master; now repeating to himself, as he turns over the
      leaves of his favourite Horace, some of those lines that make the
      shortness of life the excuse for seizing its pleasures and eluding its
      fatigues, which formed the staple morality of the polished epicurean; and
      Violante (into what glorious beauty her maiden bloom has matured!) comes
      softly into the room, seats herself on a low stool beside him, leaning her
      face on her hands, and looking up at him through her dark, clear,
      spiritual eyes; and as she continues to speak, gradually a change comes
      over Harley's aspect, gradually the brow grows thoughtful, and the lips
      lose their playful smile. There is no hateful assumption of the would-be
      "superior woman," no formal remonstrance, no lecture, no homily which
      grates upon masculine pride; but the high theme and the eloquent words
      elevate unconsciously of themselves, and the Horace is laid aside,&mdash;a
      Parliamentary Blue Book has been, by some marvel or other, conjured there
      in its stead; and Violante now moves away as softly as she entered.
      Harley's hand detains her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so. Share the task, or I quit it. Here is an extract I condemn you to
      copy. Do you think I would go through this labour if you were not to halve
      the success?&mdash;halve the labour as well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Violante, overjoyed, kisses away the implied rebuke, and sits down to
      work, so demure and so proud, by his side. I do not know if Harley made
      much way in the Blue Book that morning; but a little time after he spoke
      in the Lords, and surpassed all that the most sanguine had hoped from his
      talents. The sweetness of fame and the consciousness of utility once fully
      tasted, Harley's consummation of his proper destinies was secure. A year
      later, and his voice was one of the influences of England. His boyish love
      of glory revived,&mdash;no longer vague and dreamy, but ennobled into
      patriotism, and strengthened into purpose. One night, after a signal
      triumph, he returned home, with his father, who had witnessed it, and
      Violante&mdash;who all lovely, all brilliant, though she was, never went
      forth in her lord's absence, to lower among fops and flatterers the
      dignity of the name she so aspired to raise&mdash;sprang to meet him.
      Harley's eldest son&mdash;a boy yet in the nursery&mdash;had been kept up
      later than usual; perhaps Violante had anticipated her husband's triumph,
      and wished the son to share it. The old earl beckoned the child to him,
      and laying his hand on the infant's curly locks, said with unusual
      seriousness,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy, you may see troubled times in England before these hairs are as
      gray as mine; and your stake in England's honour and peace will be great.
      Heed this hint from an old man who had no talents to make a noise in the
      world, but who yet has been of some use in his generation. Neither
      sounding titles, nor wide lands, nor fine abilities, will give you real
      joy, unless you hold yourself responsible for all to your God and to your
      country; and when you are tempted to believe that the gifts you may
      inherit from both entail no duties, or that duties are at war with true
      pleasure, remember how I placed you in your father's arms, and said, 'Let
      him be as proud of you some day as I at this hour am of him.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy clung to his father's breast, and said manfully, "I will try!"
      Harley bent his fair smooth brow over the young earnest face, and said
      softly, "Your mother speaks in you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old countess, who had remained silent and listening on her
      elbow-chair, rose and kissed the earl's hand reverently. Perhaps in that
      kiss there was the repentant consciousness how far the active goodness she
      had often secretly undervalued had exceeded, in its fruits, her own cold
      unproductive powers of will and mind. Then passing on to Harley, her brow
      grew elate, and the pride returned to her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last," she said, laying on his shoulder that light firm hand, from
      which he no longer shrunk,&mdash;"at last, O my noble son, you have
      fulfilled all the promise of your youth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If so," answered Harley, "it is because I have found what I then sought
      in vain." He drew his arm around Violante, and added, with half tender,
      half solemn smile, "Blessed is the woman who exalts!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, symbolled forth in these twin and fair flowers which Eve saved for
      Earth out of Paradise, each with the virtue to heal or to strengthen,
      stored under the leaves that give sweets to the air; here, soothing the
      heart when the world brings the trouble; here, recruiting the soul which
      our sloth or our senses enervate, leave we Woman, at least in the place
      Heaven assigns to her amidst the multiform "Varieties of Life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Farewell to thee, gentle Reader; and go forth to the world, O MY NOVEL!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END. <br /><br /><br /><br />

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
