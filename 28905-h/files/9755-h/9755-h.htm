    <h2>
      PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1845.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Much has been written by critics, especially by those in Germany (the
      native land of criticism), upon the important question, whether to please
      or to instruct should be the end of Fiction&mdash;whether a moral purpose
      is or is not in harmony with the undidactic spirit perceptible in the
      higher works of the imagination. And the general result of the discussion
      has been in favour of those who have contended that Moral Design, rigidly
      so called, should be excluded from the aims of the Poet; that his Art
      should regard only the Beautiful, and be contented with the indirect moral
      tendencies, which can never fail the creation of the Beautiful. Certainly,
      in fiction, to interest, to please, and sportively to elevate&mdash;to
      take man from the low passions, and the miserable troubles of life, into a
      higher region, to beguile weary and selfish pain, to excite a genuine
      sorrow at vicissitudes not his own, to raise the passions into sympathy
      with heroic struggles&mdash;and to admit the soul into that serener
      atmosphere from which it rarely returns to ordinary existence, without
      some memory or association which ought to enlarge the domain of thought
      and exalt the motives of action;&mdash;such, without other moral result or
      object, may satisfy the Poet,* and constitute the highest and most
      universal morality he can effect. But subordinate to this, which is not
      the duty, but the necessity, of all Fiction that outlasts the hour, the
      writer of imagination may well permit to himself other purposes and
      objects, taking care that they be not too sharply defined, and too
      obviously meant to contract the Poet into the Lecturer&mdash;the Fiction
      into the Homily. The delight in Shylock is not less vivid for the Humanity
      it latently but profoundly inculcates; the healthful merriment of the
      Tartufe is not less enjoyed for the exposure of the Hypocrisy it
      denounces. We need not demand from Shakespeare or from Moliere other
      morality than that which Genius unconsciously throws around it&mdash;the
      natural light which it reflects; but if some great principle which guides
      us practically in the daily intercourse with men becomes in the general
      lustre more clear and more pronounced, we gain doubly, by the general
      tendency and the particular result.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  *[I use the word Poet in its proper sense, as applicable to any
   writer, whether in verse or prose, who invents or creates.]
</pre>
    <p>
      Long since, in searching for new regions in the Art to which I am a
      servant, it seemed to me that they might be found lying far, and rarely
      trodden, beyond that range of conventional morality in which Novelist
      after Novelist had entrenched himself&mdash;amongst those subtle recesses
      in the ethics of human life in which Truth and Falsehood dwell undisturbed
      and unseparated. The vast and dark Poetry around us&mdash;the Poetry of
      Modern Civilisation and Daily Existence, is shut out from us in much, by
      the shadowy giants of Prejudice and Fear. He who would arrive at the Fairy
      Land must face the Phantoms. Betimes, I set myself to the task of
      investigating the motley world to which our progress in humanity has
      attained, caring little what misrepresentation I incurred, what hostility
      I provoked, in searching through a devious labyrinth for the foot-tracks
      of Truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pursuit of this object, I am, not vainly, conscious that I have had
      my influence on my time&mdash;that I have contributed, though humbly and
      indirectly, to the benefits which Public Opinion has extorted from
      Governments and Laws. While (to content myself with a single example) the
      ignorant or malicious were decrying the moral of Paul Clifford, I consoled
      myself with perceiving that its truths had stricken deep&mdash;that many,
      whom formal essays might not reach, were enlisted by the picture and the
      popular force of Fiction into the service of that large and Catholic
      Humanity which frankly examines into the causes of crime, which
      ameliorates the ills of society by seeking to amend the circumstances by
      which they are occasioned; and commences the great work of justice to
      mankind by proportioning the punishment to the offence. That work, I know,
      had its share in the wise and great relaxation of our Criminal Code&mdash;it
      has had its share in results yet more valuable, because leading to more
      comprehensive reforms&mdash;viz., in the courageous facing of the ills
      which the mock decorum of timidity would shun to contemplate, but which,
      till fairly fronted, in the spirit of practical Christianity, sap daily,
      more and more, the walls in which blind Indolence would protect itself
      from restless Misery and rampant Hunger. For it is not till Art has told
      the unthinking that nothing (rightly treated) is too low for its breath to
      vivify and its wings to raise, that the Herd awaken from their chronic
      lethargy of contempt, and the Lawgiver is compelled to redress what the
      Poet has lifted into esteem. In thus enlarging the boundaries of the
      Novelist, from trite and conventional to untrodden ends, I have seen, not
      with the jealousy of an author, but with the pride of an Originator, that
      I have served as a guide to later and abler writers, both in England and
      abroad. If at times, while imitating, they have mistaken me, I am not
      answerable for their errors; or if, more often, they have improved where
      they borrowed, I am not envious of their laurels. They owe me at least
      this, that I prepared the way for their reception, and that they would
      have been less popular and more misrepresented, if the outcry which bursts
      upon the first researches into new directions had not exhausted its noisy
      vehemence upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Novel of Night and Morning I have had various ends in view&mdash;subordinate,
      I grant, to the higher and more durable morality which belongs to the
      Ideal, and instructs us playfully while it interests, in the passions, and
      through the heart. First&mdash;to deal fearlessly with that universal
      unsoundness in social justice which makes distinctions so marked and
      iniquitous between Vice and Crime&mdash;viz., between the corrupting
      habits and the violent act&mdash;which scarce touches the former with the
      lightest twig in the fasces&mdash;which lifts against the latter the edge
      of the Lictor&rsquo;s axe. Let a child steal an apple in sport, let a starveling
      steal a roll in despair, and Law conducts them to the Prison, for evil
      commune to mellow them for the gibbet. But let a man spend one
      apprenticeship from youth to old age in vice&mdash;let him devote a
      fortune, perhaps colossal, to the wholesale demoralisation of his kind&mdash;and
      he may be surrounded with the adulation of the so-called virtuous, and be
      served upon its knee, by that Lackey&mdash;the Modern World! I say not
      that Law can, or that Law should, reach the Vice as it does the Crime; but
      I say, that Opinion may be more than the servile shadow of Law. I impress
      not here, as in Paul Clifford, a material moral to work its effect on the
      Journals, at the Hustings, through Constituents, and on Legislation;&mdash;I
      direct myself to a channel less active, more tardy, but as sure&mdash;to
      the Conscience&mdash;that reigns elder and superior to all Law, in men&rsquo;s
      hearts and souls;&mdash;I utter boldly and loudly a truth, if not all
      untold, murmured feebly and falteringly before, sooner or later it will
      find its way into the judgment and the conduct, and shape out a tribunal
      which requires not robe or ermine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly&mdash;in this work I have sought to lift the mask from the timid
      selfishness which too often with us bears the name of Respectability.
      Purposely avoiding all attraction that may savour of extravagance,
      patiently subduing every tone and every hue to the aspect of those whom we
      meet daily in our thoroughfares, I have shown in Robert Beaufort the man
      of decorous phrase and bloodless action&mdash;the systematic self-server&mdash;in
      whom the world forgive the lack of all that is generous, warm, and noble,
      in order to respect the passive acquiescence in methodical conventions and
      hollow forms. And how common such men are with us in this century, and how
      inviting and how necessary their delineation, may be seen in this,&mdash;that
      the popular and pre-eminent Observer of the age in which we live has since
      placed their prototype in vigorous colours upon imperishable canvas.&mdash;[Need
      I say that I allude to the Pecksniff of Mr. Dickens?]
    </p>
    <p>
      There is yet another object with which I have identified my tale. I trust
      that I am not insensible to such advantages as arise from the diffusion of
      education really sound, and knowledge really available;&mdash;for these,
      as the right of my countrymen, I have contended always. But of late years
      there has been danger that what ought to be an important truth may be
      perverted into a pestilent fallacy. Whether for rich or for poor,
      disappointment must ever await the endeavour to give knowledge without
      labour, and experience without trial. Cheap literature and popular
      treatises do not in themselves suffice to fit the nerves of man for the
      strife below, and lift his aspirations, in healthful confidence above. He
      who seeks to divorce toil from knowledge deprives knowledge of its most
      valuable property.&mdash;the strengthening of the mind by exercise. We
      learn what really braces and elevates us only in proportion to the effort
      it costs us. Nor is it in Books alone, nor in Books chiefly, that we are
      made conscious of our strength as Men; Life is the great Schoolmaster,
      Experience the mighty Volume. He who has made one stern sacrifice of self
      has acquired more than he will ever glean from the odds and ends of
      popular philosophy. And the man the least scholastic may be more robust in
      the power that is knowledge, and approach nearer to the Arch-Seraphim,
      than Bacon himself, if he cling fast to two simple maxims&mdash;&ldquo;Be honest
      in temptation, and in Adversity believe in God.&rdquo; Such moral, attempted
      before in Eugene Aram, I have enforced more directly here; and out of such
      convictions I have created hero and heroine, placing them in their
      primitive and natural characters, with aid more from life than books,&mdash;from
      courage the one, from affection the other&mdash;amidst the feeble
      Hermaphrodites of our sickly civilisation;&mdash;examples of resolute
      Manhood and tender Womanhood.

      The opinions I have here put forth are not in fashion at this day. But I
      have never consulted the popular any more than the sectarian, Prejudice.
      Alone and unaided I have hewn out my way, from first to last, by the force
      of my own convictions. The corn springs up in the field centuries after
      the first sower is forgotten. Works may perish with the workman; but, if
      truthful, their results are in the works of others, imitating, borrowing,
      enlarging, and improving, in the everlasting Cycle of Industry and
      Thought.

    <p>
      I have nothing to add to the preceding pages, written six years ago, as to
      the objects and aims of this work; except to say, and by no means as a
      boast, that the work lays claims to one kind of interest which I certainly
      never desired to effect for it&mdash;viz., in exemplifying the glorious
      uncertainty of the Law. For, humbly aware of the blunders which Novelists
      not belonging to the legal profession are apt to commit, when they summon
      to the denouement of a plot the aid of a deity so mysterious as Themis, I
      submitted to an eminent lawyer the whole case of &ldquo;Beaufort versus
      Beaufort,&rdquo; as it stands in this Novel. And the pages which refer to that
      suit were not only written from the opinion annexed to the brief I sent
      in, but submitted to the eye of my counsel, and revised by his pen.&mdash;(N.B.
      He was feed.) Judge then my dismay when I heard long afterwards that the
      late Mr. O&rsquo;Connell disputed the soundness of the law I had thus bought and
      paid for! &ldquo;Who shall decide when doctors disagree?&rdquo; All I can say is, that
      I took the best opinion that love or money could get me; and I should add,
      that my lawyer, unawed by the alleged ipse dixit of the great Agitator (to
      be sure, he is dead), still stoutly maintains his own views of the
      question.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [I have, however, thought it prudent so far to meet the objection
   suggested by Mr. O&rsquo;Connell, as to make a slight alteration in this
   edition, which will probably prevent the objection, if correct,
   being of any material practical effect on the disposition of that
   visionary El Dorado&mdash;the Beaufort Property.]

        &ldquo;Now rests our vicar. They who knew him best,

</pre>
    <p>
      In one of the Welsh counties is a small village called A&mdash;&mdash;. It
      is somewhat removed from the high road, and is, therefore, but little
      known to those luxurious amateurs of the picturesque, who view nature
      through the windows of a carriage and four. Nor, indeed, is there
      anything, whether of scenery or association, in the place itself,
      sufficient to allure the more sturdy enthusiast from the beaten tracks
      which tourists and guide-books prescribe to those who search the Sublime
      and Beautiful amidst the mountain homes of the ancient Britons. Still, on
      the whole, the village is not without its attractions. It is placed in a
      small valley, through which winds and leaps down many a rocky fall, a
      clear, babbling, noisy rivulet, that affords excellent sport to the
      brethren of the angle. Thither, accordingly, in the summer season
      occasionally resort the Waltons of the neighbourhood&mdash;young farmers,
      retired traders, with now and then a stray artist, or a roving student
      from one of the universities. Hence the solitary hostelry of A&mdash;&mdash;,
      being somewhat more frequented, is also more clean and comfortable than
      could reasonably be anticipated from the insignificance and remoteness of
      the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a time in which my narrative opens, the village boasted a sociable,
      agreeable, careless, half-starved parson, who never failed to introduce
      himself to any of the anglers who, during the summer months, passed a day
      or two in the little valley. The Rev. Mr. Caleb Price had been educated at
      the University of Cambridge, where he had contrived, in three years, to
      run through a little fortune of L3500. It is true, that he acquired in
      return the art of making milkpunch, the science of pugilism, and the
      reputation of one of the best-natured, rattling, open-hearted companions
      whom you could desire by your side in a tandem to Newmarket, or in a row
      with the bargemen. By the help of these gifts and accomplishments, he had
      not failed to find favour, while his money lasted, with the young
      aristocracy of the &ldquo;Gentle Mother.&rdquo; And, though the very reverse of an
      ambitious or calculating man, he had certainly nourished the belief that
      some one of the &ldquo;hats&rdquo; or &ldquo;tinsel gowns&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., young lords or
      fellow-commoners, with whom he was on such excellent terms, and who supped
      with him so often, would do something for him in the way of a living. But
      it so happened that when Mr. Caleb Price had, with a little difficulty,
      scrambled through his degree, and found himself a Bachelor of Arts and at
      the end of his finances, his grand acquaintances parted from him to their
      various posts in the State Militant of Life. And, with the exception of
      one, joyous and reckless as himself, Mr. Caleb Price found that when Money
      makes itself wings it flies away with our friends. As poor Price had
      earned no academical distinction, so he could expect no advancement from
      his college; no fellowship; no tutorship leading hereafter to livings,
      stalls, and deaneries. Poverty began already to stare him in the face,
      when the only friend who, having shared his prosperity, remained true to
      his adverse fate,&mdash;a friend, fortunately for him, of high connections
      and brilliant prospects&mdash;succeeded in obtaining for him the humble
      living of A&mdash;&mdash;. To this primitive spot the once jovial
      roisterer cheerfully retired&mdash;contrived to live contented upon an
      income somewhat less than he had formerly given to his groom&mdash;preached
      very short sermons to a very scanty and ignorant congregation, some of
      whom only understood Welsh&mdash;did good to the poor and sick in his own
      careless, slovenly way&mdash;and, uncheered or unvexed by wife and
      children, he rose in summer with the lark and in winter went to bed at
      nine precisely, to save coals and candles. For the rest, he was the most
      skilful angler in the whole county; and so willing to communicate the
      results of his experience as to the most taking colour of the flies, and
      the most favoured haunts of the trout&mdash;that he had given especial
      orders at the inn, that whenever any strange gentleman came to fish, Mr.
      Caleb Price should be immediately sent for. In this, to be sure, our
      worthy pastor had his usual recompense. First, if the stranger were
      tolerably liberal, Mr. Price was asked to dinner at the inn; and,
      secondly, if this failed, from the poverty or the churlishness of the
      obliged party, Mr. Price still had an opportunity to hear the last news&mdash;to
      talk about the Great World&mdash;in a word, to exchange ideas, and perhaps
      to get an old newspaper, or an odd number of a magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it so happened that one afternoon in October, when the periodical
      excursions of the anglers, becoming gradually rarer and more rare, had
      altogether ceased, Mr. Caleb Price was summoned from his parlour in which
      he had been employed in the fabrication of a net for his cabbages, by a
      little white-headed boy, who came to say there was a gentleman at the inn
      who wished immediately to see him&mdash;a strange gentleman, who had never
      been there before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price threw down his net, seized his hat, and, in less than five
      minutes, he was in the best room of the little inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person there awaiting him was a man who, though plainly clad in a
      velveteen shooting-jacket, had an air and mien greatly above those common
      to the pedestrian visitors of A&mdash;&mdash;. He was tall, and of one of
      those athletic forms in which vigour in youth is too often followed by
      corpulence in age. At this period, however, in the full prime of manhood&mdash;the
      ample chest and sinewy limbs, seen to full advantage in their simple and
      manly dress&mdash;could not fail to excite that popular admiration which
      is always given to strength in the one sex as to delicacy in the other.
      The stranger was walking impatiently to and fro the small apartment when
      Mr. Price entered; and then, turning to the clergyman a countenance
      handsome and striking, but yet more prepossessing from its expression of
      frankness than from the regularity of its features,&mdash;he stopped
      short, held out his hand, and said, with a gay laugh, as he glanced over
      the parson&rsquo;s threadbare and slovenly costume, &ldquo;My poor Caleb!&mdash;what a
      metamorphosis!&mdash;I should not have known you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you! Is it possible, my dear fellow?&mdash;how glad I am to see
      you! What on earth can bring you to such a place? No! not a soul would
      believe me if I said I had seen you in this miserable hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely the reason why I am here. Sit down, Caleb, and we&rsquo;ll
      talk over matters as soon as our landlord has brought up the materials for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The milk-punch,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Price, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that will bring us back to old times, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the punch was prepared, and after two or three
      preparatory glasses, the stranger thus commenced: &ldquo;My dear Caleb, I am in
      want of your assistance, and above all of your secrecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you both beforehand. It will make me happy the rest of my life
      to think I have served my patron&mdash;my benefactor&mdash;the only friend
      I possess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, man! don&rsquo;t talk of that: we shall do better for you one of these
      days. But now to the point: I have come here to be married&mdash;married,
      old boy! married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the stranger threw himself back in his chair, and chuckled with the
      glee of a schoolboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the parson, gravely. &ldquo;It is a serious thing to do, and a
      very odd place to come to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit both propositions: this punch is superb. To proceed. You know
      that my uncle&rsquo;s immense fortune is at his own disposal; if I disobliged
      him, he would be capable of leaving all to my brother; I should disoblige
      him irrevocably if he knew that I had married a tradesman&rsquo;s daughter; I am
      going to marry a tradesman&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;a girl in a million! the
      ceremony must be as secret as possible. And in this church, with you for
      the priest, I do not see a chance of discovery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you marry by license?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my intended is not of age; and we keep the secret even from her
      father. In this village you will mumble over the bans without one of your
      congregation ever taking heed of the name. I shall stay here a month for
      the purpose. She is in London, on a visit to a relation in the city. The
      bans on her side will be published with equal privacy in a little church
      near the Tower, where my name will be no less unknown than hers. Oh, I&rsquo;ve
      contrived it famously!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear fellow, consider what you risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have considered all, and I find every chance in my favour. The bride
      will arrive here on the day of our wedding: my servant will be one
      witness; some stupid old Welshman, as antediluvian as possible&mdash;I
      leave it to you to select him&mdash;shall be the other. My servant I shall
      dispose of, and the rest I can depend on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I detest buts; if I had to make a language, I would not admit such a word
      in it. And now, before I run on about Catherine, a subject quite
      inexhaustible, tell me, my dear friend, something about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        .......
</pre>
    <p>
      Somewhat more than a month had elapsed since the arrival of the stranger
      at the village inn. He had changed his quarters for the Parsonage&mdash;went
      out but little, and then chiefly on foot excursions among the sequestered
      hills in the neighbourhood. He was therefore but partially known by sight,
      even in the village; and the visit of some old college friend to the
      minister, though indeed it had never chanced before, was not, in itself,
      so remarkable an event as to excite any particular observation. The bans
      had been duly, and half audibly, hurried over, after the service was
      concluded, and while the scanty congregation were dispersing down the
      little aisle of the church,&mdash;when one morning a chaise and pair
      arrived at the Parsonage. A servant out of livery leaped from the box. The
      stranger opened the door of the chaise, and, uttering a joyous
      exclamation, gave his arm to a lady, who, trembling and agitated, could
      scarcely, even with that stalwart support, descend the steps. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she
      said, in a voice choked with tears, when they found themselves alone in
      the little parlour,&mdash;&ldquo;ah! if you knew how I have suffered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How is it that certain words, and those the homeliest, which the hand
      writes and the eye reads as trite and commonplace expressions&mdash;when
      spoken convey so much,&mdash;so many meanings complicated and refined?
      &ldquo;Ah! if you knew how I have suffered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the lover heard these words, his gay countenance fell; he drew back&mdash;his
      conscience smote him: in that complaint was the whole history of a
      clandestine love, not for both the parties, but for the woman&mdash;the
      painful secrecy&mdash;the remorseful deceit&mdash;the shame&mdash;the fear&mdash;the
      sacrifice. She who uttered those words was scarcely sixteen. It is an
      early age to leave Childhood behind for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own love! you have suffered, indeed; but it is over now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over! And what will they say of me&mdash;what will they think of me at
      home? Over! Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but for a short time; in the course of nature my uncle cannot live
      long: all then will be explained. Our marriage once made public, all
      connected with you will be proud to own you. You will have wealth, station&mdash;a
      name among the first in the gentry of England. But, above all, you will
      have the happiness to think that your forbearance for a time has saved me,
      and, it may be, our children, sweet one!&mdash;from poverty and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; interrupted the girl; and the expression of her
      countenance became serene and elevated. &ldquo;It is for you&mdash;for your
      sake. I know what you hazard: how much I must owe you! Forgive me, this is
      the last murmur you shall ever hear from these lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour after these words were spoken, the marriage ceremony was
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caleb,&rdquo; said the bridegroom, drawing the clergyman aside as they were
      about to re-enter the house, &ldquo;you will keep your promise, I know; and you
      think I may depend implicitly upon the good faith of the witness you have
      selected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon his good faith?&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Caleb, smiling, &ldquo;but upon his
      deafness, his ignorance, and his age. My poor old clerk! He will have
      forgotten all about it before this day three months. Now I have seen your
      lady, I no longer wonder that you incur so great a risk. I never beheld so
      lovely a countenance. You will be happy!&rdquo; And the village priest sighed,
      and thought of the coming winter and his own lonely hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friend, you have only seen her beauty&mdash;it is her least
      charm. Heaven knows how often I have made love; and this is the only woman
      I have ever really loved. Caleb, there is an excellent living that adjoins
      my uncle&rsquo;s house. The rector is old; when the house is mine, you will not
      be long without the living. We shall be neighbours, Caleb, and then you
      shall try and find a bride for yourself. Smith,&rdquo;&mdash;and the bridegroom
      turned to the servant who had accompanied his wife, and served as a second
      witness to the marriage,&mdash;&ldquo;tell the post-boy to put to the horses
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir. May I speak a word with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle, sir, sent for me to come to him, the day before we left
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&mdash;indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I could just pick up among his servants that he had some suspicion&mdash;at
      least, that he had been making inquiries&mdash;and seemed very cross,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir, I was afraid. He has such a way with him;&mdash;whenever his eye
      is fixed on mine, I always feel as if it was impossible to tell a lie; and&mdash;and&mdash;in
      short, I thought it was best not to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did right. Confound this fellow!&rdquo; muttered the bridegroom, turning
      away; &ldquo;he is honest, and loves me: yet, if my uncle sees him, he is clumsy
      enough to betray all. Well, I always meant to get him out of the way&mdash;the
      sooner the better. Smith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have often said that you should like, if you had some capital, to
      settle in Australia. Your father is an excellent farmer; you are above the
      situation you hold with me; you are well educated, and have some knowledge
      of agriculture; you can scarcely fail to make a fortune as a settler; and
      if you are of the same mind still, why, look you, I have just L1000. at my
      bankers: you shall have half, if you like to sail by the first packet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, you are too generous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense&mdash;no thanks&mdash;I am more prudent than generous; for I
      agree with you that it is all up with me if my uncle gets hold of you. I
      dread my prying brother, too; in fact, the obligation is on my side; only
      stay abroad till I am a rich man, and my marriage made public, and then
      you may ask of me what you will. It&rsquo;s agreed, then; order the horses,
      we&rsquo;ll go round by Liverpool, and learn about the vessels. By the way, my
      good fellow, I hope you see nothing now of that good-for-nothing brother
      of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, sir. It&rsquo;s a thousand pities he has turned out so ill; for he
      was the cleverest of the family, and could always twist me round his
      little finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very reason I mentioned him. If he learned our secret, he
      would take it to an excellent market. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiding, I suspect, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall put the sea between you and him! So now all&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caleb stood by the porch of his house as the bride and bridegroom entered
      their humble vehicle. Though then November, the day was exquisitely mild
      and calm, the sky without a cloud, and even the leafless trees seemed to
      smile beneath the cheerful sun. And the young bride wept no more; she was
      with him she loved&mdash;she was his for ever. She forgot the rest. The
      hope&mdash;the heart of sixteen&mdash;spoke brightly out through the
      blushes that mantled over her fair cheeks. The bridegroom&rsquo;s frank and
      manly countenance was radiant with joy. As he waved his hand to Caleb from
      the window the post-boy cracked his whip, the servant settled himself on
      the dickey, the horses started off in a brisk trot,&mdash;the clergyman
      was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be married is certainly an event in life; to marry other people is, for
      a priest, a very ordinary occurrence; and yet, from that day, a great
      change began to operate in the spirits and the habits of Caleb Price. Have
      you ever, my gentle reader, buried yourself for some time quietly in the
      lazy ease of a dull country-life? Have you ever become gradually
      accustomed to its monotony, and inured to its solitude; and, just at the
      time when you have half-forgotten the great world&mdash;that mare magnum
      that frets and roars in the distance&mdash;have you ever received in your
      calm retreat some visitor, full of the busy and excited life which you
      imagined yourself contented to relinquish? If so, have you not perceived,
      that, in proportion as his presence and communication either revived old
      memories, or brought before you new pictures of &ldquo;the bright tumult&rdquo; of
      that existence of which your guest made a part,&mdash;you began to compare
      him curiously with yourself; you began to feel that what before was to
      rest is now to rot; that your years are gliding from you unenjoyed and
      wasted; that the contrast between the animal life of passionate
      civilisation and the vegetable torpor of motionless seclusion is one that,
      if you are still young, it tasks your philosophy to bear,&mdash;feeling
      all the while that the torpor may be yours to your grave? And when your
      guest has left you, when you are again alone, is the solitude the same as
      it was before?
    </p>
    <p>
      Our poor Caleb had for years rooted his thoughts to his village. His guest
      had been like the Bird in the Fairy Tale, settling upon the quiet
      branches, and singing so loudly and so gladly of the enchanted skies afar,
      that, when it flew away, the tree pined, nipped and withering in the sober
      sun in which before it had basked contented. The guest was, indeed, one of
      those men whose animal spirits exercise upon such as come within their
      circle the influence and power usually ascribed only to intellectual
      qualities. During the month he had sojourned with Caleb, he had brought
      back to the poor parson all the gaiety of the brisk and noisy novitiate
      that preceded the solemn vow and the dull retreat;&mdash;the social
      parties, the merry suppers, the open-handed, open-hearted fellowship of
      riotous, delightful, extravagant, thoughtless YOUTH. And Caleb was not a
      bookman&mdash;not a scholar; he had no resources in himself, no occupation
      but his indolent and ill-paid duties. The emotions, therefore, of the
      Active Man were easily aroused within him. But if this comparison between
      his past and present life rendered him restless and disturbed, how much
      more deeply and lastingly was he affected by a contrast between his own
      future and that of his friend! Not in those points where he could never
      hope equality&mdash;wealth and station&mdash;the conventional distinctions
      to which, after all, a man of ordinary sense must sooner or later
      reconcile himself&mdash;but in that one respect wherein all, high and low,
      pretend to the same rights&mdash;rights which a man of moderate warmth of
      feeling can never willingly renounce&mdash;viz., a partner in a lot
      however obscure; a kind face by a hearth, no matter how mean it be! And
      his happier friend, like all men full of life, was full of himself&mdash;full
      of his love, of his future, of the blessings of home, and wife, and
      children. Then, too, the young bride seemed so fair, so confiding, and so
      tender; so formed to grace the noblest or to cheer the humblest home! And
      both were so happy, so all in all to each other, as they left that barren
      threshold! And the priest felt all this, as, melancholy and envious, he
      turned from the door in that November day, to find himself thoroughly
      alone. He now began seriously to muse upon those fancied blessings which
      men wearied with celibacy see springing, heavenward, behind the altar. A
      few weeks afterwards a notable change was visible in the good man&rsquo;s
      exterior. He became more careful of his dress, he shaved every morning, he
      purchased a crop-eared Welsh cob; and it was soon known in the
      neighbourhood that the only journey the cob was ever condemned to take was
      to the house of a certain squire, who, amidst a family of all ages,
      boasted two very pretty marriageable daughters. That was the second holy
      day-time of poor Caleb&mdash;the love-romance of his life: it soon closed.
      On learning the amount of the pastor&rsquo;s stipend the squire refused to
      receive his addresses; and, shortly after, the girl to whom he had
      attached himself made what the world calls a happy match: and perhaps it
      was one, for I never heard that she regretted the forsaken lover. Probably
      Caleb was not one of those whose place in a woman&rsquo;s heart is never to be
      supplied. The lady married, the world went round as before, the brook
      danced as merrily through the village, the poor worked on the week-days,
      and the urchins gambolled round the gravestones on the Sabbath,&mdash;and
      the pastor&rsquo;s heart was broken. He languished gradually and silently away.
      The villagers observed that he had lost his old good-humoured smile; that
      he did not stop every Saturday evening at the carrier&rsquo;s gate, to ask if
      there were any news stirring in the town which the carrier weekly visited;
      that he did not come to borrow the stray newspapers that now and then
      found their way into the village; that, as he sauntered along the
      brookside, his clothes hung loose on his limbs, and that he no longer
      &ldquo;whistled as he went;&rdquo; alas, he was no longer &ldquo;in want of thought!&rdquo; By
      degrees, the walks themselves were suspended; the parson was no longer
      visible: a stranger performed his duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, it might be some three years and more after the fatal visit I
      have commemorated&mdash;one very wild rough day in early March, the
      postman, who made the round of the district, rang at the parson&rsquo;s bell.
      The single female servant, her red hair loose on her neck, replied to the
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is the master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very bad;&rdquo; and the girl wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should leave you something handsome,&rdquo; remarked the postman, kindly, as
      he pocketed the money for the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pastor was in bed&mdash;the boisterous wind rattled down the chimney
      and shook the ill-fitting casement in its rotting frame. The clothes he
      had last worn were thrown carelessly about, unsmoothed, unbrushed; the
      scanty articles of furniture were out of their proper places; slovenly
      discomfort marked the death-chamber. And by the bedside stood a
      neighbouring clergyman, a stout, rustic, homely, thoroughly Welsh priest,
      who might have sat for the portrait of Parson Adams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter for you,&rdquo; said the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me!&rdquo; echoed Caleb, feebly. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;well&mdash;is it not very dark,
      or are my eyes failing?&rdquo; The clergyman and the servant drew aside the
      curtains and propped the sick man up: he read as follows, slowly, and with
      difficulty:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR, CALEB,&mdash;At last I can do something for you. A friend of mine
      has a living in his gift just vacant, worth, I understand, from three to
      four hundred a year: pleasant neighbourhood&mdash;small parish. And my
      friend keeps the hounds!&mdash;just the thing for you. He is, however, a
      very particular sort of person&mdash;wants a companion, and has a horror
      of anything evangelical; wishes, therefore, to see you before he decides.
      If you can meet me in London, some day next month, I&rsquo;ll present you to
      him, and I have no doubt it will be settled. You must think it strange I
      never wrote to you since we parted, but you know I never was a very good
      correspondent; and as I had nothing to communicate advantageous to you I
      thought it a sort of insult to enlarge on my own happiness, and so forth.
      All I shall say on that score is, that I&rsquo;ve sown my wild oats; and that
      you may take my word for it, there&rsquo;s nothing that can make a man know how
      large the heart is, and how little the world, till he comes home (perhaps
      after a hard day&rsquo;s hunting) and sees his own fireside, and hears one dear
      welcome; and&mdash;oh, by the way, Caleb, if you could but see my boy, the
      sturdiest little rogue! But enough of this. All that vexes me is, that
      I&rsquo;ve never yet been able to declare my marriage: my uncle, however,
      suspects nothing: my wife bears up against all, like an angel as she is;
      still, in case of any accident, it occurs to me, now I&rsquo;m writing to you,
      especially if you leave the place, that it may be as well to send me an
      examined copy of the register. In those remote places registers are often
      lost or mislaid; and it may be useful hereafter, when I proclaim the
      marriage, to clear up all doubt as to the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, old fellow,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours most truly, &amp;c., &amp;c.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes too late,&rdquo; sighed Caleb, heavily; and the letter fell from his
      hands. There was a long pause. &ldquo;Close the shutters,&rdquo; said the sick man, at
      last; &ldquo;I think I could sleep: and&mdash;and&mdash;pick up that letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a trembling, but eager gripe, he seized the paper, as a miser would
      seize the deeds of an estate on which he has a mortgage. He smoothed the
      folds, looked complacently at the well-known hand, smiled&mdash;a ghastly
      smile! and then placed the letter under his pillow, and sank down; they
      left him alone. He did not wake for some hours, and that good clergyman,
      poor as himself, was again at his post. The only friendships that are
      really with us in the hour of need are those which are cemented by
      equality of circumstance. In the depth of home, in the hour of
      tribulation, by the bed of death, the rich and the poor are seldom found
      side by side. Caleb was evidently much feebler; but his sense seemed
      clearer than it had been, and the instincts of his native kindness were
      the last that left him. &ldquo;There is something he wants me do for him,&rdquo; he
      muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I remember: Jones, will you send for the parish register? It is
      somewhere in the vestry-room, I think&mdash;but nothing&rsquo;s kept properly.
      Better go yourself&mdash;&lsquo;tis important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jones nodded, and sallied forth. The register was not in the vestry;
      the church-wardens knew nothing about it; the clerk&mdash;a new clerk, who
      was also the sexton, and rather a wild fellow&mdash;had gone ten miles off
      to a wedding: every place was searched; till, at last, the book was found,
      amidst a heap of old magazines and dusty papers, in the parlour of Caleb
      himself. By the time it was brought to him, the sufferer was fast
      declining; with some difficulty his dim eye discovered the place where,
      amidst the clumsy pothooks of the parishioners, the large clear hand of
      the old friend, and the trembling characters of the bride, looked forth,
      distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extract this for me, will you?&rdquo; said Caleb. Mr. Jones obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, just write above the extract:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&mdash;By Mr. Price&rsquo;s desire I send you the inclosed. He is too ill
      to write himself. But he bids me say that he has never been quite the same
      man since you left him; and that, if he should not get well again, still
      your kind letter has made him easier in his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caleb stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I have to say: sign your name, and put the address&mdash;here
      it is. Ah, the letter,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;must not lie about! If anything
      happens to me, it may get him into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Mr. Jones sealed his communication, Caleb feebly stretched his wan
      hand, held the letter which had &ldquo;come too late&rdquo; over the flame of the
      candle. As the blazing paper dropped on the carpetless floor, Mr. Jones
      prudently set thereon the broad sole of his top-boot, and the maidservant
      brushed the tinder into the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, trample it out:&mdash;hurry it amongst the ashes. The last as the
      rest,&rdquo; said Caleb, hoarsely. &ldquo;Friendship, fortune, hope, love, life&mdash;a
      little flame, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite out!&rdquo; said Mr. Jones. Caleb turned his
      face to the wall. He lingered till the next day, when he passed insensibly
      from sleep to death. As soon as the breath was out of his body, Mr. Jones
      felt that his duty was discharged, that other duties called him home. He
      promised to return to read the burial-service over the deceased, gave some
      hasty orders about the plain funeral, and was turning from the room, when
      he saw the letter he had written by Caleb&rsquo;s wish, still on the table. &ldquo;I
      pass the post-office&mdash;I&rsquo;ll put it in,&rdquo; said he to the weeping
      servant; &ldquo;and just give me that scrap of paper.&rdquo; So he wrote on the scrap,
      &ldquo;P. S. He died this morning at half-past twelve, without pain.&mdash;M.
      J.;&rdquo; and not taking the trouble to break the seal, thrust the final
      bulletin into the folds of the letter, which he then carefully placed in
      his vest pocket, and safely transferred to the post. And that was all that
      the jovial and happy man, to whom the letter was addressed, ever heard of
      the last days of his college friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The living, vacant by the death of Caleb Price, was not so valuable as to
      plague the patron with many applications. It continued vacant nearly the
      whole of the six months prescribed by law. And the desolate parsonage was
      committed to the charge of one of the villagers, who had occasionally
      assisted Caleb in the care of his little garden. The villager, his wife,
      and half-a-dozen noisy, ragged children, took possession of the quiet
      bachelor&rsquo;s abode. The furniture had been sold to pay the expenses of the
      funeral, and a few trifling bills; and, save the kitchen and the two
      attics, the empty house, uninhabited, was surrendered to the sportive
      mischief of the idle urchins, who prowled about the silent chambers in
      fear of the silence, and in ecstasy at the space. The bedroom in which
      Caleb had died was, indeed, long held sacred by infantine superstition.
      But one day the eldest boy having ventured across the threshold, two
      cupboards, the doors standing ajar, attracted the child&rsquo;s curiosity. He
      opened one, and his exclamation soon brought the rest of the children
      round him. Have you ever, reader, when a boy, suddenly stumbled on that El
      Dorado, called by the grown-up folks a lumber room? Lumber, indeed! what
      Virtu double-locks in cabinets is the real lumber to the boy! Lumber,
      reader! to thee it was a treasury! Now this cupboard had been the
      lumber-room in Caleb&rsquo;s household. In an instant the whole troop had thrown
      themselves on the motley contents. Stray joints of clumsy fishing-rods;
      artificial baits; a pair of worn-out top-boots, in which one of the
      urchins, whooping and shouting, buried himself up to the middle;
      moth-eaten, stained, and ragged, the collegian&rsquo;s gown&mdash;relic of the
      dead man&rsquo;s palmy time; a bag of carpenter&rsquo;s tools, chiefly broken; a
      cricket-bat; an odd boxing-glove; a fencing-foil, snapped in the middle;
      and, more than all, some half-finished attempts at rude toys: a boat, a
      cart, a doll&rsquo;s house, in which the good-natured Caleb had busied himself
      for the younger ones of that family in which he had found the fatal ideal
      of his trite life. One by one were these lugged forth from their dusty
      slumber-profane hands struggling for the first right of appropriation. And
      now, revealed against the wall, glared upon the startled violators of the
      sanctuary, with glassy eyes and horrent visage, a grim monster. They
      huddled back one upon the other, pale and breathless, till the eldest,
      seeing that the creature moved not, took heart, approached on
      tip-toe-twice receded, and twice again advanced, and finally drew out,
      daubed, painted, and tricked forth in the semblance of a griffin, a
      gigantic kite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children, alas! were not old and wise enough to knew all the dormant
      value of that imprisoned aeronaut, which had cost Caleb many a dull
      evening&rsquo;s labour&mdash;the intended gift to the false one&rsquo;s favourite
      brother. But they guessed that it was a thing or spirit appertaining of
      right to them; and they resolved, after mature consultation, to impart the
      secret of their discovery to an old wooden-legged villager, who had served
      in the army, who was the idol of all the children of the place, and who,
      they firmly believed, knew everything under the sun, except the mystical
      arts of reading and writing. Accordingly, having seen that the coast was
      clear&mdash;for they considered their parents (as the children of the
      hard-working often do) the natural foes to amusement&mdash;they carried
      the monster into an old outhouse, and ran to the veteran to beg him to
      come up slyly and inspect its properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months after this memorable event, arrived the new pastor&mdash;a
      slim, prim, orderly, and starch young man, framed by nature and trained by
      practice to bear a great deal of solitude and starving. Two loving couples
      had waited to be married till his Reverence should arrive. The ceremony
      performed, where was the registry-book? The vestry was searched&mdash;the
      church-wardens interrogated; the gay clerk, who, on the demise of his deaf
      predecessor, had come into office a little before Caleb&rsquo;s last illness,
      had a dim recollection of having taken the registry up to Mr. Price at the
      time the vestry-room was whitewashed. The house was searched&mdash;the
      cupboard, the mysterious cupboard, was explored. &ldquo;Here it is, sir!&rdquo; cried
      the clerk; and he pounced upon a pale parchment volume. The thin clergyman
      opened it, and recoiled in dismay&mdash;more than three-fourths of the
      leaves had been torn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the moths, sir,&rdquo; said the gardener&rsquo;s wife, who had not yet removed
      from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman looked round; one of the children was trembling. &ldquo;What have
      you done to this book, little one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That book?&mdash;the&mdash;hi!&mdash;hi!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak the truth, and you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know it was any harm&mdash;hi!&mdash;hi!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And old Ben helped us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;hi!&mdash;hi!&mdash;The tail of the kite,
      sir!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the kite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! the kite and its tail were long ago gone to that undiscovered limbo
      where all things lost, broken, vanished, and destroyed; things that lose
      themselves&mdash;for servants are too honest to steal; things that break
      themselves&mdash;for servants are too careful to break; find an
      everlasting and impenetrable refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not signify a pin&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; said the clerk; &ldquo;the parish must find
      a new &lsquo;un!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no fault of mine,&rdquo; said the Pastor. &ldquo;Are my chops ready?&rdquo;

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than you ever will, I fear, unless&mdash;&rdquo; and here there was a
      certain hesitation in the mother&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;unless your father consents to
      your going to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should like to go to Eton! That&rsquo;s the only school for a
      gentleman. I&rsquo;ve heard my father say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip, you are too proud.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Proud! you often call me proud; but,
      then, you kiss me when you do so. Kiss me now, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady drew her son to her breast, put aside the clustering hair from
      his forehead, and kissed him; but the kiss was sad, and the moment after
      she pushed him away gently and muttered, unconscious that she was
      overheard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, after all, my devotion to the father should wrong the children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy started, and a cloud passed over his brow; but he said nothing. A
      light step entered the room through the French casements that opened on
      the lawn, and the mother turned to her youngest-born, and her eye
      brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma! mamma! here is a letter for you. I snatched it from John: it is
      papa&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady uttered a joyous exclamation, and seized the letter. The younger
      child nestled himself on a stool at her feet, looking up while she read
      it; the elder stood apart, leaning on his gun, and with something of
      thought, even of gloom, upon his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a strong contrast in the two boys. The elder, who was about
      fifteen, seemed older than he was, not only from his height, but from the
      darkness of his complexion, and a certain proud, nay, imperious,
      expression upon features that, without having the soft and fluent graces
      of childhood, were yet regular and striking. His dark-green
      shooting-dress, with the belt and pouch, the cap, with its gold tassel set
      upon his luxuriant curls, which had the purple gloss of the raven&rsquo;s plume,
      blended perhaps something prematurely manly in his own tastes, with the
      love of the fantastic and the picturesque which bespeaks the presiding
      genius of the proud mother. The younger son had scarcely told his ninth
      year; and the soft, auburn ringlets, descending half-way down the
      shoulders; the rich and delicate bloom that exhibits at once the hardy
      health and the gentle fostering; the large deep-blue eyes; the flexile and
      almost effeminate contour of the harmonious features; altogether made such
      an ideal of childlike beauty as Lawrence had loved to paint or Chantrey
      model. And the daintiest cares of a mother, who, as yet, has her darling
      all to herself&mdash;her toy, her plaything&mdash;were visible in the
      large falling collar of finest cambric, and the blue velvet dress with its
      filigree buttons and embroidered sash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the boys had about them the air of those whom Fate ushers blandly
      into life; the air of wealth, and birth, and luxury, spoiled and pampered
      as if earth had no thorn for their feet, and heaven not a wind to visit
      their young cheeks too roughly. The mother had been extremely handsome;
      and though the first bloom of youth was now gone, she had still the beauty
      that might captivate new love&mdash;an easier task than to retain the old.
      Both her sons, though differing from each other, resembled her; she had
      the features of the younger; and probably any one who had seen her in her
      own earlier youth would have recognized in that child&rsquo;s gay yet gentle
      countenance the mirror of the mother when a girl. Now, however, especially
      when silent or thoughtful, the expression of her face was rather that of
      the elder boy;&mdash;the cheek, once so rosy was now pale, though clear,
      with something which time had given, of pride and thought, in the curved
      lip and the high forehead. One who could have looked on her in her more
      lonely hours, might have seen that the pride had known shame, and the
      thought was the shadow of the passions of fear and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now as she read those hasty, brief, but well-remembered characters&mdash;read
      as one whose heart was in her eyes&mdash;joy and triumph alone were
      visible in that eloquent countenance. Her eyes flashed, her breast heaved;
      and at length, clasping the letter to her lips, she kissed it again and
      again with passionate transport. Then, as her eyes met the dark,
      inquiring, earnest gaze of her eldest born, she flung her arms round him,
      and wept vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, mamma, dear mamma?&rdquo; said the youngest, pushing
      himself between Philip and his mother. &ldquo;Your father is coming back, this
      day&mdash;this very hour;&mdash;and you&mdash;you&mdash;child&mdash;you,
      Philip&mdash;&rdquo; Here sobs broke in upon her words, and left her speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter that had produced this effect ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      TO MRS MORTON, Fernside Cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAREST KATE,&mdash;My last letter prepared you for the news I have now
      to relate&mdash;my poor uncle is no more. Though I had seen little of him,
      especially of late years, his death sensibly affected me; but I have at
      least the consolation of thinking that there is nothing now to prevent my
      doing justice to you. I am the sole heir to his fortune&mdash;I have it in
      my power, dearest Kate, to offer you a tardy recompense for all you have
      put up with for my sake;&mdash;a sacred testimony to your long
      forbearance, your unreproachful love, your wrongs, and your devotion. Our
      children, too&mdash;my noble Philip!&mdash;kiss them, Kate&mdash;kiss them
      for me a thousand times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I write in great haste&mdash;the burial is just over, and my letter will
      only serve to announce my return. My darling Catherine, I shall be with
      you almost as soon as these lines meet your eyes&mdash;those clear eyes,
      that, for all the tears they have shed for my faults and follies, have
      never looked the less kind. Yours, ever as ever, &ldquo;PHILIP BEAUFORT.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter has told its tale, and little remains to explain. Philip
      Beaufort was one of those men of whom there are many in his peculiar class
      of society&mdash;easy, thoughtless, good-humoured, generous, with feelings
      infinitely better than his principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inheriting himself but a moderate fortune, which was three parts in the
      hands of the Jews before he was twenty-five, he had the most brilliant
      expectations from his uncle; an old bachelor, who, from a courtier, had
      turned a misanthrope&mdash;cold&mdash;shrewd&mdash;penetrating&mdash;worldly&mdash;sarcastic&mdash;and
      imperious; and from this relation he received, meanwhile, a handsome and,
      indeed, munificent allowance. About sixteen years before the date at which
      this narrative opens, Philip Beaufort had &ldquo;run off,&rdquo; as the saying is,
      with Catherine Morton, then little more than a child,&mdash;a motherless
      child&mdash;educated at a boarding-school to notions and desires far
      beyond her station; for she was the daughter of a provincial tradesman.
      And Philip Beaufort, in the prime of life, was possessed of most of the
      qualities that dazzle the eyes and many of the arts that betray the
      affections. It was suspected by some that they were privately married: if
      so, the secret had been closely kept, and baffled all the inquiries of the
      stern old uncle. Still there was much, not only in the manner, at once
      modest and dignified, but in the character of Catherine, which was proud
      and high-spirited, to give colour to the suspicion. Beaufort, a man
      naturally careless of forms, paid her a marked and punctilious respect;
      and his attachment was evidently one not only of passion, but of
      confidence and esteem. Time developed in her mental qualities far superior
      to those of Beaufort, and for these she had ample leisure of cultivation.
      To the influence derived from her mind and person she added that of a
      frank, affectionate, and winning disposition; their children cemented the
      bond between them. Mr. Beaufort was passionately attached to field sports.
      He lived the greater part of the year with Catherine, at the beautiful
      cottage to which he had built hunting stables that were the admiration of
      the county; and though the cottage was near London, the pleasures of the
      metropolis seldom allured him for more than a few days&mdash;generally but
      a few hours&mdash;at a time; and he&mdash;always hurried back with renewed
      relish to what he considered his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the connection between Catherine and himself (and of the true
      nature of that connection, the Introductory Chapter has made the reader
      more enlightened than the world), her influence had, at least, weaned from
      all excesses, and many follies, a man who, before he knew her, had seemed
      likely, from the extreme joviality and carelessness of his nature, and a
      very imperfect education, to contract whatever vices were most in fashion
      as preservatives against ennui. And if their union had been openly
      hallowed by the Church, Philip Beaufort had been universally esteemed the
      model of a tender husband and a fond father. Ever, as he became more and
      more acquainted with Catherine&rsquo;s natural good qualities, and more and more
      attached to his home, had Mr. Beaufort, with the generosity of true
      affection, desired to remove from her the pain of an equivocal condition
      by a public marriage. But Mr. Beaufort, though generous, was not free from
      the worldliness which had met him everywhere, amidst the society in which
      his youth had been spent. His uncle, the head of one of those families
      which yearly vanish from the commonalty into the peerage, but which once
      formed a distinguished peculiarity in the aristocracy of England&mdash;families
      of ancient birth, immense possessions, at once noble and untitled&mdash;held
      his estates by no other tenure than his own caprice. Though he professed
      to like Philip, yet he saw but little of him. When the news of the illicit
      connection his nephew was reported to have formed reached him, he at first
      resolved to break it off; but observing that Philip no longer gambled, nor
      ran in debt, and had retired from the turf to the safer and more
      economical pastimes of the field, he contented himself with inquiries
      which satisfied him that Philip was not married; and perhaps he thought
      it, on the whole, more prudent to wink at an error that was not attended
      by the bills which had here-to-fore characterised the human infirmities of
      his reckless nephew. He took care, however, incidentally, and in reference
      to some scandal of the day, to pronounce his opinion, not upon the fault,
      but upon the only mode of repairing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever,&rdquo; said he, and he looked grimly at Philip while he spoke, &ldquo;a
      gentleman were to disgrace his ancestry by introducing into his family one
      whom his own sister could not receive at her house, why, he ought to sink
      to her level, and wealth would but make his disgrace the more notorious.
      If I had an only son, and that son were booby enough to do anything so
      discreditable as to marry beneath him, I would rather have my footman for
      my successor. You understand, Phil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did understand, and looked round at the noble house and the stately
      park, and his generosity was not equal to the trial. Catherine&mdash;so
      great was her power over him&mdash;might, perhaps, have easily triumphed
      over his more selfish calculations; but her love was too delicate ever to
      breathe, of itself, the hope that lay deepest at her heart. And her
      children!&mdash;ah! for them she pined, but for them she also hoped.
      Before them was a long future, and she had all confidence in Philip. Of
      late, there had been considerable doubts how far the elder Beaufort would
      realise the expectations in which his nephew had been reared. Philip&rsquo;s
      younger brother had been much with the old gentleman, and appeared to be
      in high favour: this brother was a man in every respect the opposite to
      Philip&mdash;sober, supple, decorous, ambitious, with a face of smiles and
      a heart of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old gentleman was taken dangerously ill, and Philip was summoned
      to his bed of death. Robert, the younger brother, was there also, with his
      wife (who he had married prudently) and his children (he had two, a son
      and a daughter). Not a word did the uncle say as to the disposition of his
      property till an hour before he died. And then, turning in his bed, he
      looked first at one nephew, then at the other, and faltered out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip, you are a scapegrace, but a gentleman! Robert, you are a careful,
      sober, plausible man; and it is a great pity you were not in business; you
      would have made a fortune!&mdash;you won&rsquo;t inherit one, though you think
      it: I have marked you, sir. Philip, beware of your brother. Now let me see
      the parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man died; the will was read; and Philip succeeded to a rental of
      L20,000. a-year; Robert, to a diamond ring, a gold repeater, L5,000. and a
      curious collection of bottled snakes.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>

   Let him within his pleasant garden walk;
   Give him her arm&mdash;of blessings let them talk.&rdquo;&mdash;CRABBE.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Robert, there! now you can see the new stables. By Jove, they are
      the completest thing in the three kingdoms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a pile! But is that the house? You lodge your horses more
      magnificently than yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it not a beautiful cottage?&mdash;to be sure, it owes everything
      to Catherine&rsquo;s taste. Dear Catherine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Beaufort, for this colloquy took place between the brothers, as
      their britska rapidly descended the hill, at the foot of which lay
      Fernside Cottage and its miniature demesnes&mdash;Mr. Robert Beaufort
      pulled his travelling cap over his brows, and his countenance fell,
      whether at the name of Catherine, or the tone in which the name was
      uttered; and there was a pause, broken by a third occupant of the britska,
      a youth of about seventeen, who sat opposite the brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who are those boys on the lawn, uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are those boys?&rdquo; It was a simple question, but it grated on the ear
      of Mr. Robert Beaufort&mdash;it struck discord at his heart. &ldquo;Who were
      those boys?&rdquo; as they ran across the sward, eager to welcome their father
      home; the westering sun shining full on their joyous faces&mdash;their
      young forms so lithe and so graceful&mdash;their merry laughter ringing in
      the still air. &ldquo;Those boys,&rdquo; thought Mr. Robert Beaufort, &ldquo;the sons of
      shame, rob mine of his inheritance.&rdquo; The elder brother turned round at his
      nephew&rsquo;s question, and saw the expression on Robert&rsquo;s face. He bit his
      lip, and answered, gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur, they are my children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know you were married,&rdquo; replied Arthur, bending forward to take
      a better view of his cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Beaufort smiled bitterly, and Philip&rsquo;s brow grew crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped at the little lodge. Philip opened the door, and
      jumped to the ground; the brother and his son followed. A moment more, and
      Philip was locked in Catherine&rsquo;s arms, her tears falling fast upon his
      breast; his children plucking at his coat; and the younger one crying in
      his shrill, impatient treble, &ldquo;Papa! papa! you don&rsquo;t see Sidney, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Beaufort placed his hand on his son&rsquo;s shoulder, and arrested
      his steps, as they contemplated the group before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arthur,&rdquo; said he, in a hollow whisper, &ldquo;those children are our disgrace
      and your supplanters; they are bastards! bastards! and they are to be his
      heirs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur made no answer, but the smile with which he had hitherto gazed on
      his new relations vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, as he turned from Mrs. Morton, and lifted his
      youngest-born in his arms, &ldquo;this is my brother and his son: they are
      welcome, are they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert bowed low, and extended his hand, with stiff affability, to
      Mrs. Morton, muttering something equally complimentary and inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party proceeded towards the house. Philip and Arthur brought up the
      rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you shoot?&rdquo; asked Arthur, observing the gun in his cousin&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I hope this season to bag as many head as my father: he is a famous
      shot. But this is only a single barrel, and an old-fashioned sort of
      detonator. My father must get me one of the new gulls: I can&rsquo;t afford it
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Arthur, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as to that,&rdquo; resumed Philip, quickly, and with a heightened colour,
      &ldquo;I could have managed it very well if I had not given thirty guineas for a
      brace of pointers the other day: they are the best dogs you ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty guineas!&rdquo; echoed Arthur, looking with native surprise at the
      speaker; &ldquo;why, how old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just fifteen last birthday. Holla, John! John Green!&rdquo; cried the young
      gentleman in an imperious voice, to one of the gardeners, who was crossing
      the lawn, &ldquo;see that the nets are taken down to the lake to-morrow, and
      that my tent is pitched properly, by the lime-trees, by nine o&rsquo;clock. I
      hope you will understand me this time: Heaven knows you take a deal of
      telling before you understand anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Philip,&rdquo; said the man, bowing obsequiously; and then muttered,
      as he went off, &ldquo;Drat the nat&rsquo;rel! He speaks to a poor man as if he warn&rsquo;t
      flesh and blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your father keep hunters?&rdquo; asked Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps one reason may be, that he is not rich enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s a pity. Never mind, we&rsquo;ll mount you, whenever you like to pay
      us a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Arthur drew himself up, and his air, naturally frank and gentle,
      became haughty and reserved. Philip gazed on him, and felt offended; he
      scarce knew why, but from that moment he conceived a dislike to his
      cousin.

   &ldquo;For a man is helpless and vain, of a condition so exposed to

    <p>
      The two brothers sat at their wine after dinner. Robert sipped claret, the
      sturdy Philip quaffed his more generous port. Catherine and the boys might
      be seen at a little distance, and by the light of a soft August moon,
      among the shrubs and bosquets of the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip Beaufort was about five-and-forty, tall, robust, nay, of great
      strength of frame and limb; with a countenance extremely winning, not only
      from the comeliness of its features, but its frankness, manliness, and
      good nature. His was the bronzed, rich complexion, the inclination towards
      embonpoint, the athletic girth of chest, which denote redundant health,
      and mirthful temper, and sanguine blood. Robert, who had lived the life of
      cities, was a year younger than his brother; nearly as tall, but pale,
      meagre, stooping, and with a careworn, anxious, hungry look, which made
      the smile that hung upon his lips seem hollow and artificial. His dress,
      though plain, was neat and studied; his manner, bland and plausible; his
      voice, sweet and low: there was that about him which, if it did not win
      liking, tended to excite respect&mdash;a certain decorum, a nameless
      propriety of appearance and bearing, that approached a little to
      formality: his every movement, slow and measured, was that of one who
      paced in the circle that fences round the habits and usages of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;I had always decided to take this step, whenever my
      poor uncle&rsquo;s death should allow me to do so. You have seen Catherine, but
      you do not know half her good qualities: she would grace any station; and,
      besides, she nursed me so carefully last year, when I broke my collar-bone
      in that cursed steeple-chase. Egad, I am getting too heavy and growing too
      old for such schoolboy pranks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s excellence, and I honour your motives;
      still, when you talk of her gracing any station, you must not forget, my
      dear brother, that she will be no more received as Mrs. Beaufort than she
      is now as Mrs. Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you, Robert, that I am really married to her already; that she
      would never have left her home but on that condition; that we were married
      the very day we met after her flight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert&rsquo;s thin lips broke into a slight sneer of incredulity. &ldquo;My dear
      brother, you do right to say this&mdash;any man in your situation would
      say the same. But I know that my uncle took every pains to ascertain if
      the report of a private marriage were true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you helped him in the search. Eh, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob slightly blushed. Philip went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! to be sure you did; you knew that such a discovery would have
      done for me in the old gentleman&rsquo;s good opinion. But I blinded you both,
      ha, ha! The fact is, that we were married with the greatest privacy; that
      even now, I own, it would be difficult for Catherine herself to establish
      the fact, unless I wished it. I am ashamed to think that I have never even
      told her where I keep the main proof of the marriage. I induced one
      witness to leave the country, the other must be long since dead: my poor
      friend, too, who officiated, is no more. Even the register, Bob, the
      register itself, has been destroyed: and yet, notwithstanding, I will
      prove the ceremony and clear up poor Catherine&rsquo;s fame; for I have the
      attested copy of the register safe and sound. Catherine not married! why,
      look at her, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Beaufort glanced at the window for a moment, but his
      countenance was still that of one unconvinced. &ldquo;Well, brother,&rdquo; said he,
      dipping his fingers in the water-glass, &ldquo;it is not for me to contradict
      you. It is a very curious tale&mdash;parson dead&mdash;witnesses missing.
      But still, as I said before, if you are resolved on a public marriage, you
      are wise to insist that there has been a previous private one. Yet,
      believe me, Philip,&rdquo; continued Robert, with solemn earnestness, &ldquo;the world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the world! What do I care for the world! We don&rsquo;t want to go to
      routs and balls, and give dinners to fine people. I shall live much the
      same as I have always done; only, I shall now keep the hounds&mdash;they
      are very indifferently kept at present&mdash;and have a yacht; and engage
      the best masters for the boys. Phil wants to go to Eton, but I know what
      Eton is: poor fellow! his feelings might be hurt there, if others are as
      sceptical as yourself. I suppose my old friends will not be less civil now
      I have L20,000. a year. And as for the society of women, between you and
      me, I don&rsquo;t care a rush for any woman but Catherine: poor Katty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are the best judge of your own affairs: you don&rsquo;t misinterpret
      my motives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Bob, no. I am quite sensible how kind it is in you&mdash;a man of
      your starch habits and strict views, coming here to pay a mark of respect
      to Kate (Mr. Robert turned uneasily in his chair)&mdash;even before you
      knew of the private marriage, and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t blame you for never
      having done it before. You did quite right to try your chance with my
      uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert turned in his chair again, still more uneasily, and cleared his
      voice as if to speak. But Philip tossed off his wine, and proceeded,
      without heeding his brother,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And though the poor old man does not seem to have liked you the better
      for consulting his scruples, yet we must make up for the partiality of his
      will. Let me see&mdash;what with your wife&rsquo;s fortune, you muster L2000. a
      year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only L1500., Philip, and Arthur&rsquo;s education is growing expensive. Next
      year he goes to college. He is certainly very clever, and I have great
      hopes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he will do Honour to us all&mdash;so have I. He is a noble young
      fellow: and I think my Philip may find a great deal to learn from him,&mdash;Phil
      is a sad idle dog; but with a devil of a spirit, and sharp as a needle. I
      wish you could see him ride. Well, to return to Arthur. Don&rsquo;t trouble
      yourself about his education&mdash;that shall be my care. He shall go to
      Christ Church&mdash;a gentleman-commoner, of course&mdash;and when he is
      of age we&rsquo;ll get him into parliament. Now for yourself, Bob. I shall sell
      the town-house in Berkeley Square, and whatever it brings you shall have.
      Besides that, I&rsquo;ll add L1500. a year to your L1000.&mdash;so that&rsquo;s said
      and done. Pshaw! brothers should be brothers.&mdash;Let&rsquo;s come out and
      play with the boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two Beauforts stepped through the open casement into the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look pale, Bob&mdash;all you London fellows do. As for me, I feel as
      strong as a horse: much better than when I was one of your gay dogs
      straying loose about the town. &lsquo;Gad, I have never had a moment&rsquo;s ill
      health, except from a fall now and then. I feel as if I should live for
      ever, and that&rsquo;s the reason why I could never make a will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never, then, made your will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never as yet. Faith, till now, I had little enough to leave. But now that
      all this great Beaufort property is at my own disposal, I must think of
      Kate&rsquo;s jointure. By Jove! now I speak of it, I will ride to&mdash;&mdash;to-morrow,
      and consult the lawyer there both about the will and the marriage. You
      will stay for the wedding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I must go into &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shire to-morrow evening, to
      place Arthur with his tutor. But I&rsquo;ll return for the wedding, if you
      particularly wish it: only Mrs. Beaufort is a woman of very strict&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;do particularly wish it,&rdquo; interrupted Philip, gravely; &ldquo;for I
      desire, for Catherine&rsquo;s sake, that you, my sole surviving relation, may
      not seem to withhold your countenance from an act of justice to her. And
      as for your wife, I fancy L1500. a year would reconcile her to my marrying
      out of the Penitentiary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert bowed his head, coughed huskily, and said, &ldquo;I appreciate your
      generous affection, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, while the elder parties were still over the
      breakfast-table, the younger people were in the grounds; it was a lovely
      day, one of the last of the luxuriant August&mdash;and Arthur, as he
      looked round, thought he had never seen a more beautiful place. It was,
      indeed, just the spot to captivate a youthful and susceptible fancy. The
      village of Fernside, though in one of the counties adjoining Middlesex,
      and as near to London as the owner&rsquo;s passionate pursuits of the field
      would permit, was yet as rural and sequestered as if a hundred miles
      distant from the smoke of the huge city. Though the dwelling was called a
      cottage, Philip had enlarged the original modest building into a villa of
      some pretensions. On either side a graceful and well-proportioned portico
      stretched verandahs, covered with roses and clematis; to the right
      extended a range of costly conservatories, terminating in vistas of
      trellis-work which formed those elegant alleys called roseries, and served
      to screen the more useful gardens from view. The lawn, smooth and even,
      was studded with American plants and shrubs in flower, and bounded on one
      side by a small lake, on the opposite bank of which limes and cedars threw
      their shadows over the clear waves. On the other side a light fence
      separated the grounds from a large paddock, in which three or four hunters
      grazed in indolent enjoyment. It was one of those cottages which bespeak
      the ease and luxury not often found in more ostentatious mansions&mdash;an
      abode which, at sixteen, the visitor contemplates with vague notions of
      poetry and love&mdash;which, at forty, he might think dull and d&mdash;-d
      expensive&mdash;which, at sixty, he would pronounce to be damp in winter,
      and full of earwigs in the summer. Master Philip was leaning on his gun;
      Master Sidney was chasing a peacock butterfly; Arthur was silently gazing
      on the shining lake and the still foliage that drooped over its surface.
      In the countenance of this young man there was something that excited a
      certain interest. He was less handsome than Philip, but the expression of
      his face was more prepossessing. There was something of pride in the
      forehead; but of good nature, not unmixed with irresolution and weakness,
      in the curves of the mouth. He was more delicate of frame than Philip; and
      the colour of his complexion was not that of a robust constitution. His
      movements were graceful and self-possessed, and he had his father&rsquo;s
      sweetness of voice. &ldquo;This is really beautiful!&mdash;I envy you, cousin
      Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has not your father got a country-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: we live either in London or at some hot, crowded watering-place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; this is very nice during the shooting and hunting season. But my old
      nurse says we shall have a much finer place now. I liked this very well
      till I saw Lord Belville&rsquo;s place. But it is very unpleasant not to have
      the finest house in the county: <i>aut Caesar aut nullus</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      my motto. Ah! do you see that swallow? I&rsquo;ll bet you a guinea I hit it.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;No, poor thing! don&rsquo;t hurt it.&rdquo; But ere the remonstrance was uttered, the
      bird lay quivering on the ground. &ldquo;It is just September, and one must keep
      one&rsquo;s hand in,&rdquo; said Philip, as he reloaded his gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Arthur this action seemed a wanton cruelty; it was rather the wanton
      recklessness which belongs to a wild boy accustomed to gratify the impulse
      of the moment&mdash;the recklessness which is not cruelty in the boy, but
      which prosperity may pamper into cruelty in the man. And scarce had he
      reloaded his gun before the neigh of a young colt came from the
      neighbouring paddock, and Philip bounded to the fence. &ldquo;He calls me, poor
      fellow; you shall see him feed from my hand. Run in for a piece of bread&mdash;a
      large piece, Sidney.&rdquo; The boy and the animal seemed to understand each
      other. &ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t like horses,&rdquo; he said to Arthur. &ldquo;As for me, I
      love dogs, horses&mdash;every dumb creature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except swallows.&rdquo; said Arthur, with a half smile, and a little surprised
      at the inconsistency of the boast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is short,&mdash;all fair: it is not to hurt the swallow&mdash;it
      is to obtain skill,&rdquo; said Philip, colouring; and then, as if not quite
      easy with his own definition, he turned away abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is dull work&mdash;suppose we fish. By Jove!&rdquo; (he had caught his
      father&rsquo;s expletive) &ldquo;that blockhead has put the tent on the wrong side of
      the lake, after all. Holla, you, sir!&rdquo; and the unhappy gardener looked up
      from his flower-beds; &ldquo;what ails you? I have a great mind to tell my
      father of you&mdash;you grow stupider every day. I told you to put the
      tent under the lime-trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could not manage it, sir; the boughs were in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you not cut the boughs, blockhead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not dare do so, sir, without master&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; said the man
      doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My orders are sufficient, I should think; so none of your impertinence,&rdquo;
       cried Philip, with a raised colour; and lifting his hand, in which he held
      his ramrod, he shook it menacingly over the gardener&rsquo;s head,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
      great mind to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Philip?&rdquo; cried the good-humoured voice of his father.
      &ldquo;Fie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fellow does not mind what I say, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not like to cut the boughs of the lime-trees without your orders,
      sir,&rdquo; said the gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it would be a pity to cut them. You should consult me there, Master
      Philip;&rdquo; and the father shook him by the collar with a good-natured, and
      affectionate, but rough sort of caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, father!&rdquo; said the boy, petulantly and proudly; &ldquo;or,&rdquo; he added,
      in a lower voice, but one which showed emotion, &ldquo;my cousin may think you
      mean less kindly than you always do, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father was touched: &ldquo;Go and cut the lime-boughs, John; and always do
      as Mr. Philip tells you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother was behind, and she sighed audibly. &ldquo;Ah! dearest, I fear you
      will spoil him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not your son? and do we not owe him the more respect for having
      hitherto allowed others to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and the mother could say no more. And thus it was, that this
      boy of powerful character and strong passions had, from motives the most
      amiable, been pampered from the darling into the despot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Kate, I will, as I told you last night, ride over to &mdash;&mdash;
      and fix the earliest day for our public marriage: I will ask the lawyer to
      dine here, to talk about the proper steps for proving the private one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will that be difficult&rdquo; asked Catherine, with natural anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&mdash;for if you remember, I had the precaution to get an examined
      copy of the register; otherwise, I own to you, I should have been alarmed.
      I don&rsquo;t know what has become of Smith. I heard some time since from his
      father that he had left the colony; and (I never told you before&mdash;it
      would have made you uneasy) once, a few years ago, when my uncle again got
      it into his head that we might be married, I was afraid poor Caleb&rsquo;s
      successor might, by chance, betray us. So I went over to A&mdash;&mdash;
      myself, being near it when I was staying with Lord C&mdash;&mdash;, in
      order to see how far it might be necessary to secure the parson; and, only
      think! I found an accident had happened to the register&mdash;so, as the
      clergyman could know nothing, I kept my own counsel. How lucky I have the
      copy! No doubt the lawyer will set all to rights; and, while I am making
      the settlements, I may as well make my will. I have plenty for both boys,
      but the dark one must be the heir. Does he not look born to be an eldest
      son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! one don&rsquo;t die the sooner for making a will. Have I the air of a
      man in a consumption?&rdquo;&mdash;and the sturdy sportsman glanced complacently
      at the strength and symmetry of his manly limbs. &ldquo;Come, Phil, let&rsquo;s go to
      the stables. Now, Robert, I will show you what is better worth seeing than
      those miserable flower-beds.&rdquo; So saying, Mr. Beaufort led the way to the
      courtyard at the back of the cottage. Catherine and Sidney remained on the
      lawn; the rest followed the host. The grooms, of whom Beaufort was the
      idol, hastened to show how well the horses had thriven in his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do see how Brown Bess has come on, sir! but, to be sure, Master Philip
      keeps her in exercise. Ah, sir, he will be as good a rider as your honour,
      one of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be a better, Tom; for I think he&rsquo;ll never have my weight to
      carry. Well, saddle Brown Bess for Mr. Philip. What horse shall I take?
      Ah! here&rsquo;s my old friend, Puppet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come to Puppet, sir; he&rsquo;s off his feed, and turned
      sulky. I tried him over the bar yesterday; but he was quite restive like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil he was! So, so, old boy, you shall go over the six-barred gate
      to-day, or we&rsquo;ll know why.&rdquo; And Mr. Beaufort patted the sleek neck of his
      favourite hunter. &ldquo;Put the saddle on him, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your honour. I sometimes think he is hurt in the loins somehow&mdash;he
      don&rsquo;t take to his leaps kindly, and he always tries to bite when we
      bridles him. Be quiet, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only his airs,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I did not know this, or I would have taken
      him over the gate. Why did not you tell me, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord love you, sir! because you have such a spurret; and if anything had
      come to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right: you are not weight enough for Puppet, my boy; and he never
      did like any one to back him but myself. What say you, brother, will you
      ride with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must go to &mdash;&mdash; to-day with Arthur. I have engaged the
      post-horses at two o&rsquo;clock; but I shall be with you to-morrow or the day
      after. You see his tutor expects him; and as he is backward in his
      mathematics, he has no time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, good-bye, nephew!&rdquo; and Beaufort slipped a pocket-book into
      the boy&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Tush! whenever you want money, don&rsquo;t trouble your father&mdash;write
      to me&mdash;we shall be always glad to see you; and you must teach Philip
      to like his book a little better&mdash;eh, Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, father; I shall be rich enough to do without books,&rdquo; said Philip,
      rather coarsely; but then observing the heightened colour of his cousin,
      he went up to him, and with a generous impulse said, &ldquo;Arthur, you admired
      this gun; pray accept it. Nay, don&rsquo;t be shy&mdash;I can have as many as I
      like for the asking: you&rsquo;re not so well off, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intention was kind, but the manner was so patronising that Arthur felt
      offended. He put back the gun, and said, drily, &ldquo;I shall have no occasion
      for the gun, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Arthur was offended by the offer, Philip was much more offended by the
      refusal. &ldquo;As you like; I hate pride,&rdquo; said he; and he gave the gun to the
      groom as he vaulted into his saddle with the lightness of a young Mercury.
      &ldquo;Come, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort had now mounted his favourite hunter&mdash;a large, powerful
      horse well known for its prowess in the field. The rider trotted him once
      or twice through the spacious yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Tom: no more hurt in the loins than I am. Open that gate; we
      will go across the paddock, and take the gate yonder&mdash;the old six-bar&mdash;eh,
      Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&mdash;to be sure!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gate was opened&mdash;the grooms stood watchful to see the leap, and a
      kindred curiosity arrested Robert Beaufort and his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      How well they looked! those two horsemen; the ease, lightness, spirit of
      the one, with the fine-limbed and fiery steed that literally &ldquo;bounded
      beneath him as a barb&rdquo;&mdash;seemingly as gay, as ardent, and as haughty
      as the boyrider. And the manly, and almost herculean form of the elder
      Beaufort, which, from the buoyancy of its movements, and the supple grace
      that belongs to the perfect mastership of any athletic art, possessed an
      elegance and dignity, especially on horseback, which rarely accompanies
      proportions equally sturdy and robust. There was indeed something knightly
      and chivalrous in the bearing of the elder Beaufort&mdash;in his handsome
      aquiline features, the erectness of his mien, the very wave of his hand,
      as he spurred from the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine-looking fellow my uncle is!&rdquo; said Arthur, with involuntary
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, an excellent life&mdash;amazingly strong!&rdquo; returned the pale father,
      with a slight sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, as they cantered across the paddock, &ldquo;I think
      the gate is too much for you. I will just take Puppet over, and then we
      will open it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, my dear father! you don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m improved!&rdquo; And slackening
      the rein, and touching the side of his horse, the young rider darted
      forward and cleared the gate, which was of no common height, with an ease
      that extorted a loud &ldquo;bravo&rdquo; from the proud father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Puppet,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, spurring his own horse. The animal
      cantered towards the gate, and then suddenly turned round with an
      impatient and angry snort. &ldquo;For shame, Puppet!&mdash;for shame, old boy!&rdquo;
       said the sportsman, wheeling him again to the barrier. The horse shook his
      head, as if in remonstrance; but the spur vigorously applied showed him
      that his master would not listen to his mute reasonings. He bounded
      forward&mdash;made at the gate&mdash;struck his hoofs against the top bar&mdash;fell
      forward, and threw his rider head foremost on the road beyond. The horse
      rose instantly&mdash;not so the master. The son dismounted, alarmed and
      terrified. His father was speechless! and blood gushed from the mouth and
      nostrils, as the head drooped heavily on the boy&rsquo;s breast. The bystanders
      had witnessed the fall&mdash;they crowded to the spot&mdash;they took the
      fallen man from the weak arms of the son&mdash;the head groom examined him
      with the eye of one who had picked up science from his experience in such
      casualties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, brother!&mdash;where are you hurt?&rdquo; exclaimed Robert Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will never speak more!&rdquo; said the groom, bursting into tears. &ldquo;His neck
      is broken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for the nearest surgeon,&rdquo; cried Mr. Robert. &ldquo;Good God! boy! don&rsquo;t
      mount that devilish horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Arthur had already leaped on the unhappy steed, which had been the
      cause of this appalling affliction. &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Straight on to &mdash;&mdash;, only two miles&mdash;every one knows Mr.
      Powis&rsquo;s house. God bless you!&rdquo; said the groom. Arthur vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lift him carefully, and take him to the house,&rdquo; said Mr. Robert. &ldquo;My poor
      brother! my dear brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a cry, a single shrill, heartbreaking cry; and
      Philip fell senseless to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one heeded him at that hour&mdash;no one heeded the fatherless BASTARD.
      &ldquo;Gently, gently,&rdquo; said Mr. Robert, as he followed the servants and their
      load. And he then muttered to himself, and his sallow cheek grew bright,
      and his breath came short: &ldquo;He has made no will&mdash;he never made a
      will.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Constance. O boy, then where art thou?
        *  * * * What becomes of me&rdquo;&mdash;King John.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was three days after the death of Philip Beaufort&mdash;for the surgeon
      arrived only to confirm the judgment of the groom: in the drawing-room of
      the cottage, the windows closed, lay the body, in its coffin, the lid not
      yet nailed down. There, prostrate on the floor, tearless, speechless, was
      the miserable Catherine; poor Sidney, too young to comprehend all his
      loss, sobbing at her side; while Philip apart, seated beside the coffin,
      gazed abstractedly on that cold rigid face which had never known one frown
      for his boyish follies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another room, that had been appropriated to the late owner, called his
      study, sat Robert Beaufort. Everything in this room spoke of the deceased.
      Partially separated from the rest of the house, it communicated by a
      winding staircase with a chamber above, to which Philip had been wont to
      betake himself whenever he returned late, and over-exhilarated, from some
      rural feast crowning a hard day&rsquo;s hunt. Above a quaint, old-fashioned
      bureau of Dutch workmanship (which Philip had picked up at a sale in the
      earlier years of his marriage) was a portrait of Catherine taken in the
      bloom of her youth. On a peg on the door that led to the staircase, still
      hung his rough driving coat. The window commanded the view of the paddock
      in which the worn-out hunter or the unbroken colt grazed at will. Around
      the walls of the &ldquo;study&rdquo;&mdash;(a strange misnomer!)&mdash;hung prints of
      celebrated fox-hunts and renowned steeple-chases: guns, fishing-rods, and
      foxes&rsquo; brushes, ranged with a sportsman&rsquo;s neatness, supplied the place of
      books. On the mantelpiece lay a cigar-case, a well-worn volume on the
      Veterinary Art, and the last number of the Sporting Magazine. And in the
      room&mdash;thus witnessing of the hardy, masculine, rural life, that had
      passed away&mdash;sallow, stooping, town-worn, sat, I say, Robert
      Beaufort, the heir-at-law,&mdash;alone: for the very day of the death he
      had remanded his son home with the letter that announced to his wife the
      change in their fortunes, and directed her to send his lawyer post-haste
      to the house of death. The bureau, and the drawers, and the boxes which
      contained the papers of the deceased were open; their contents had been
      ransacked; no certificate of the private marriage, no hint of such an
      event; not a paper found to signify the last wishes of the rich dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had died, and made no sign. Mr. Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s countenance was still
      and composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door was heard; the lawyer entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, the undertakers are here, and Mr. Greaves has ordered the bells to
      be rung: at three o&rsquo;clock he will read the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am obliged to you., Blackwell, for taking these melancholy offices on
      yourself. My poor brother!&mdash;it is so sudden! But the funeral, you
      say, ought to take place to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weather is so warm,&rdquo; said the lawyer, wiping his forehead. As he
      spoke, the death-bell was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been a terrible shock to Mrs. Morton if she had been his
      wife,&rdquo; observed Mr. Blackwell. &ldquo;But I suppose persons of that kind have
      very little feeling. I must say that it was fortunate for the family that
      the event happened before Mr. Beaufort was wheedled into so improper a
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was fortunate, Blackwell. Have you ordered the post-horses? I shall
      start immediately after the funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to be done with the cottage, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may advertise it for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Morton and the boys?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hum! we will consider. She was a
      tradesman&rsquo;s daughter. I think I ought to provide for her suitably, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than the world could expect from you, sir; it is very
      different from a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very!&mdash;very much so, indeed! Just ring for a lighted candle, we
      will seal up these boxes. And&mdash;I think I could take a sandwich. Poor
      Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The funeral was over; the dead shovelled away. What a strange thing it
      does seem, that that very form which we prized so charily, for which we
      prayed the winds to be gentle, which we lapped from the cold in our arms,
      from whose footstep we would have removed a stone, should be suddenly
      thrust out of sight&mdash;an abomination that the earth must not look upon&mdash;a
      despicable loathsomeness, to be concealed and to be forgotten! And this
      same composition of bone and muscle that was yesterday so strong&mdash;which
      men respected, and women loved, and children clung to&mdash;to-day so
      lamentably powerless, unable to defend or protect those who lay nearest to
      its heart; its riches wrested from it, its wishes spat upon, its influence
      expiring with its last sigh! A breath from its lips making all that mighty
      difference between what it was and what it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      The post-horses were at the door as the funeral procession returned to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Beaufort bowed slightly to Mrs. Morton, and said, with his
      pocket-handkerchief still before his eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write to you in a few days, ma&rsquo;am; you will find that I shall not
      forget you. The cottage will be sold; but we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurry you. Good-bye,
      ma&rsquo;am; good-bye, my boys;&rdquo; and he patted his nephews on the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip winced aside, and scowled haughtily at his uncle, who muttered to
      himself, &ldquo;That boy will come to no good!&rdquo; Little Sidney put his hand into
      the rich man&rsquo;s, and looked up, pleadingly, into his face. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you say
      something pleasant to poor mamma, Uncle Robert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort hemmed huskily, and entered the britska&mdash;it had been his
      brother&rsquo;s: the lawyer followed, and they drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after the funeral, Philip stole from the house into the
      conservatory, to gather some fruit for his mother; she had scarcely
      touched food since Beaufort&rsquo;s death. She was worn to a shadow; her hair
      had turned grey. Now she had at last found tears, and she wept noiselessly
      but unceasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had plucked some grapes, and placed them carefully in his basket:
      he was about to select a nectarine that seemed riper than the rest, when
      his hand was roughly seized; and the gruff voice of John Green, the
      gardener, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you about, Master Philip? you must not touch them &lsquo;ere fruit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you, fellow!&rdquo; cried the young gentleman, in a tone of equal
      astonishment and, wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your airs, Master Philip! What I means is, that some great folks
      are coming too look at the place tomorrow; and I won&rsquo;t have my show of
      fruit spoiled by being pawed about by the like of you; so, that&rsquo;s plain,
      Master Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy grew very pale, but remained silent. The gardener, delighted to
      retaliate the insolence he had received, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not go for to look so spiteful, master; you are not the great
      man you thought you were; you are nobody now, and so you will find ere
      long. So, march out, if you please: I wants to lock up the glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he took the lad roughly by the arm; but Philip, the most
      irascible of mortals, was strong for his years, and fearless as a young
      lion. He caught up a watering-pot, which the gardener had deposited while
      he expostulated with his late tyrant and struck the man across the face
      with it so violently and so suddenly, that he fell back over the beds, and
      the glass crackled and shivered under him. Philip did not wait for the foe
      to recover his equilibrium; but, taking up his grapes, and possessing
      himself quietly of the disputed nectarine, quitted the spot; and the
      gardener did not think it prudent to pursue him. To boys, under ordinary
      circumstances&mdash;boys who have buffeted their way through a scolding
      nursery, a wrangling family, or a public school&mdash;there would have
      been nothing in this squabble to dwell on the memory or vibrate on the
      nerves, after the first burst of passion: but to Philip Beaufort it was an
      era in life; it was the first insult he had ever received; it was his
      initiation into that changed, rough, and terrible career, to which the
      spoiled darling of vanity and love was henceforth condemned. His pride and
      his self-esteem had incurred a fearful shock. He entered the house, and a
      sickness came over him; his limbs trembled; he sat down in the hall, and,
      placing the fruit beside him, covered his face with his hands and wept.
      Those were not the tears of a boy, drawn from a shallow source; they were
      the burning, agonising, reluctant tears, that men shed, wrung from the
      heart as if it were its blood. He had never been sent to school, lest he
      should meet with mortification. He had had various tutors, trained to
      show, rather than to exact, respect; one succeeding another, at his own
      whim and caprice. His natural quickness, and a very strong, hard,
      inquisitive turn of mind, had enabled him, however, to pick up more
      knowledge, though of a desultory and miscellaneous nature, than boys of
      his age generally possess; and his roving, independent, out-of-door
      existence had served to ripen his understanding. He had certainly, in
      spite of every precaution, arrived at some, though not very distinct,
      notion of his peculiar position; but none of its inconveniences had
      visited him till that day. He began now to turn his eyes to the future;
      and vague and dark forebodings&mdash;a consciousness of the shelter, the
      protector, the station, he had lost in his father&rsquo;s death&mdash;crept
      coldly, over him. While thus musing, a ring was heard at the bell; he
      lifted his head; it was the postman with a letter. Philip hastily rose,
      and, averting his face, on which the tears were not dried, took the
      letter; and then, snatching up his little basket of fruit, repaired to his
      mother&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shutters were half closed on the bright day&mdash;oh, what a mockery
      is there in the smile of the happy sun when it shines on the wretched!
      Mrs. Morton sat, or rather crouched, in a distant corner; her streaming
      eyes fixed on vacancy; listless, drooping; a very image of desolate woe;
      and Sidney was weaving flower-chains at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&mdash;mother!&rdquo; whispered Philip, as he threw his arms round her
      neck; &ldquo;look up! look up!&mdash;my heart breaks to see you. Do taste this
      fruit: you will die too, if you go on thus; and what will become of us&mdash;of
      Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton did look up vaguely into his face, and strove to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, too, I have brought you a letter; perhaps good news; shall I break
      the seal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton shook her head gently, and took the letter&mdash;alas! how
      different from that one which Sidney had placed in her hands not two short
      weeks since&mdash;it was Mr. Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s handwriting. She shuddered,
      and laid it down. And then there suddenly, and for the first time, flashed
      across her the sense of her strange position&mdash;the dread of the
      future. What were her sons to be henceforth?
    </p>
    <p>
      What herself? Whatever the sanctity of her marriage, the law might fail
      her. At the disposition of Mr. Robert Beaufort the fate of three lives
      might depend. She gasped for breath; again took up the letter; and hurried
      over the contents: they ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MADAM,&mdash;Knowing that you must naturally be anxious as to the
      future prospects of your children and yourself, left by my poor brother
      destitute of all provision, I take the earliest opportunity which it seems
      to me that propriety and decorum allow, to apprise you of my intentions. I
      need not say that, properly speaking, you can have no kind of claim upon
      the relations of my late brother; nor will I hurt your feelings by those
      moral reflections which at this season of sorrow cannot, I hope, fail
      involuntarily to force themselves upon you. Without more than this mere
      allusion to your peculiar connection with my brother, I may, however, be
      permitted to add that that connection tended very materially to separate
      him from the legitimate branches of his family; and in consulting with
      them as to a provision for you and your children, I find that, besides
      scruples that are to be respected, some natural degree of soreness exists
      upon their minds. Out of regard, however, to my poor brother (though I saw
      very little of him of late years), I am willing to waive those feelings
      which, as a father and a husband, you may conceive that I share with the
      rest of my family. You will probably now decide on living with some of
      your own relations; and that you may not be entirely a burden to them, I
      beg to say that I shall allow you a hundred a year; paid, if you prefer
      it, quarterly. You may also select such articles of linen and plate as you
      require for your own use. With regard to your sons, I have no objection to
      place them at a grammar-school, and, at a proper age, to apprentice them
      to any trade suitable to their future station, in the choice of which your
      own family can give you the best advice. If they conduct themselves
      properly, they may always depend on my protection. I do not wish to hurry
      your movements; but it will probably be painful to you to remain longer
      than you can help in a place crowded with unpleasant recollections; and as
      the cottage is to be sold&mdash;indeed, my brother-in-law, Lord Lilburne,
      thinks it would suit him&mdash;you will be liable to the interruption of
      strangers to see it; and your prolonged residence at Fernside, you must be
      sensible, is rather an obstacle to the sale. I beg to inclose you a draft
      for L100. to pay any present expenses; and to request, when you are
      settled, to know where the first quarter shall be paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall write to Mr. Jackson (who, I think, is the bailiff) to detail my
      instructions as to selling the crops, &amp;c., and discharging the
      servants; so that you may have no further trouble.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;I am, Madam,
           &ldquo;Your obedient Servant,
                &ldquo;ROBERT BEAUFORT.
  &ldquo;Berkeley Square, September 12th, 18&mdash;.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The letter fell from Catherine&rsquo;s hands. Her grief was changed to
      indignation and scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The insolent!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;This to me!&mdash;to
      me&mdash;the wife, the lawful wife of his brother! the wedded mother of
      his brother&rsquo;s children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that again, mother! again&mdash;again!&rdquo; cried Philip, in a loud
      voice. &ldquo;His wife&mdash;wedded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; said Catherine, solemnly. &ldquo;I kept the secret for your
      father&rsquo;s sake. Now for yours, the truth must be proclaimed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! thank God!&rdquo; murmured Philip, in a quivering voice, throwing
      his arms round his brother, &ldquo;We have no brand on our names, Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those accents, so full of suppressed joy and pride, the mother felt at
      once all that her son had suspected and concealed. She felt that beneath
      his haughty and wayward character there had lurked delicate and generous
      forbearance for her; that from his equivocal position his very faults
      might have arisen; and a pang of remorse for her long sacrifice of the
      children to the father shot through her heart. It was followed by a fear,
      an appalling fear, more painful than the remorse. The proofs that were to
      clear herself and them! The words of her husband, that last awful morning,
      rang in her ear. The minister dead; the witness absent; the register lost!
      But the copy of that register!&mdash;the copy! might not that suffice? She
      groaned, and closed her eyes as if to shut out the future: then starting
      up, she hurried from the room, and went straight to Beaufort&rsquo;s study. As
      she laid her hand on the latch of the door, she trembled and drew back.
      But care for the living was stronger at that moment than even anguish for
      the dead: she entered the apartment; she passed with a firm step to the
      bureau. It was locked; Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s seal upon the lock:&mdash;on
      every cupboard, every box, every drawer, the same seal that spoke of
      rights more valued than her own. But Catherine was not daunted: she turned
      and saw Philip by her side; she pointed to the bureau in silence; the boy
      understood the appeal. He left the room, and returned in a few moments
      with a chisel. The lock was broken: tremblingly and eagerly Catherine
      ransacked the contents; opened paper after paper, letter after letter, in
      vain: no certificate, no will, no memorial. Could the brother have
      abstracted the fatal proof? A word sufficed to explain to Philip what she
      sought for; and his search was more minute than hers. Every possible
      receptacle for papers in that room, in the whole house, was explored, and
      still the search was fruitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours afterwards they were in the same room in which Philip had
      brought Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s letter to his mother. Catherine was seated,
      tearless, but deadly pale with heart-sickness and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;may I now read the letter?&rdquo; Yes, boy; and decide
      for us all. She paused, and examined his face as he read. He felt her eye
      was upon him, and restrained his emotions as he proceeded. When he had
      done, he lifted his dark gaze upon Catherine&rsquo;s watchful countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, whether or not we obtain our rights, you will still refuse this
      man&rsquo;s charity? I am young&mdash;a boy; but I am strong and active. I will
      work for you day and night. I have it in me&mdash;I feel it; anything
      rather than eating his bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip! Philip! you are indeed my son; your father&rsquo;s son! And have you no
      reproach for your mother, who so weakly, so criminally, concealed your
      birthright, till, alas! discovery may be too late? Oh! reproach me,
      reproach me! it will be kindness. No! do not kiss me! I cannot bear it.
      Boy! boy! if as my heart tells me, we fail in proof, do you understand
      what, in the world&rsquo;s eye, I am; what you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; said Philip, firmly; and he fell on his knees at her feet.&rdquo;
       Whatever others call you, you are a mother, and I your son. You are, in
      the judgment of Heaven, my father&rsquo;s Wife, and I his Heir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Catherine bowed her head, and with a gush of tears fell into his arms.
      Sidney crept up to her, and forced his lips to her cold cheek. &ldquo;Mamma!
      what vexes you? Mamma, mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sidney! Sidney! How like his father! Look at him, Philip! Shall we do
      right to refuse him even this pittance? Must he be a beggar too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never beggar,&rdquo; said Philip, with a pride that showed what hard lessons he
      had yet to learn. &ldquo;The lawful sons of a Beaufort were not born to beg
      their bread!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The storm above, and frozen world below.

     The olive bough
     Faded and cast upon the common wind,
     And earth a doveless ark.&rdquo;&mdash;LAMAN BLANCHARD.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Beaufort was generally considered by the world a very worthy
      man. He had never committed any excess&mdash;never gambled nor incurred
      debt&mdash;nor fallen into the warm errors most common with his sex. He
      was a good husband&mdash;a careful father&mdash;an agreeable neighbour&mdash;rather
      charitable than otherwise, to the poor. He was honest and methodical in
      his dealings, and had been known to behave handsomely in different
      relations of life. Mr. Robert Beaufort, indeed, always meant to do what
      was right&mdash;in the eyes of the world! He had no other rule of action
      but that which the world supplied; his religion was decorum&mdash;his
      sense of honour was regard to opinion. His heart was a dial to which the
      world was the sun: when the great eye of the public fell on it, it
      answered every purpose that a heart could answer; but when that eye was
      invisible, the dial was mute&mdash;a piece of brass and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just to Robert Beaufort to assure the reader that he wholly
      disbelieved his brother&rsquo;s story of a private marriage. He considered that
      tale, when heard for the first time, as the mere invention (and a shallow
      one) of a man wishing to make the imprudent step he was about to take as
      respectable as he could. The careless tone of his brother when speaking
      upon the subject&mdash;his confession that of such a marriage there were
      no distinct proofs, except a copy of a register (which copy Robert had not
      found)&mdash;made his incredulity natural. He therefore deemed himself
      under no obligation of delicacy or respect, to a woman through whose means
      he had very nearly lost a noble succession&mdash;a woman who had not even
      borne his brother&rsquo;s name&mdash;a woman whom nobody knew. Had Mrs. Morton
      been Mrs. Beaufort, and the natural sons legitimate children, Robert
      Beaufort, supposing their situation of relative power and dependence to
      have been the same, would have behaved with careful and scrupulous
      generosity. The world would have said, &ldquo;Nothing can be handsomer than Mr.
      Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s conduct!&rdquo; Nay, if Mrs. Morton had been some divorced
      wife of birth and connections, he would have made very different
      dispositions in her favour: he would not have allowed the connections to
      call him shabby. But here he felt that, all circumstances considered, the
      world, if it spoke at all (which it would scarce think it worth while to
      do), would be on his side. An artful woman&mdash;low-born, and, of course,
      low-bred&mdash;who wanted to inveigle her rich and careless paramour into
      marriage; what could be expected from the man she had sought to injure&mdash;the
      rightful heir? Was it not very good in him to do anything for her, and, if
      he provided for the children suitably to the original station of the
      mother, did he not go to the very utmost of reasonable expectation? He
      certainly thought in his conscience, such as it was, that he had acted
      well&mdash;not extravagantly, not foolishly; but well. He was sure the
      world would say so if it knew all: he was not bound to do anything. He was
      not, therefore, prepared for Catherine&rsquo;s short, haughty, but temperate
      reply to his letter: a reply which conveyed a decided refusal of his
      offers&mdash;asserted positively her own marriage, and the claims of her
      children&mdash;intimated legal proceedings&mdash;and was signed in the
      name of Catherine Beaufort. Mr. Beaufort put the letter in his bureau,
      labelled, &ldquo;Impertinent answer from Mrs. Morton, Sept. 14,&rdquo; and was quite
      contented to forget the existence of the writer, until his lawyer, Mr.
      Blackwell, informed him that a suit had been instituted by Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert turned pale, but Blackwell composed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, sir! you have nothing to fear. It is but an attempt to extort
      money: the attorney is a low practitioner, accustomed to get up bad cases:
      they can make nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was true: whatever the rights of the case, poor Catherine had no
      proofs&mdash;no evidence&mdash;which could justify a respectable lawyer to
      advise her proceeding to a suit. She named two witnesses of her marriage&mdash;one
      dead, the other could not be heard of. She selected for the alleged place
      in which the ceremony was performed a very remote village, in which it
      appeared that the register had been destroyed. No attested copy thereof
      was to be found, and Catherine was stunned on hearing that, even if found,
      it was doubtful whether it could be received as evidence, unless to
      corroborate actual personal testimony. It so happened that when Philip,
      many years ago, had received a copy, he had not shown it to Catherine, nor
      mentioned Mr. Jones&rsquo;s name as the copyist. In fact, then only three years
      married to Catherine, his worldly caution had not yet been conquered by
      confident experience of her generosity. As for the mere moral evidence
      dependent on the publication of her bans in London, that amounted to no
      proof whatever; nor, on inquiry at A&mdash;&mdash;, did the Welsh
      villagers remember anything further than that, some fifteen years ago, a
      handsome gentleman had visited Mr. Price, and one or two rather thought
      that Mr. Price had married him to a lady from London; evidence quite
      inadmissible against the deadly, damning fact, that, for fifteen years,
      Catherine had openly borne another name, and lived with Mr. Beaufort
      ostensibly as his mistress. Her generosity in this destroyed her case.
      Nevertheless, she found a low practitioner, who took her money and
      neglected her cause; so her suit was heard and dismissed with contempt.
      Henceforth, then, indeed, in the eyes of the law and the public, Catherine
      was an impudent adventurer, and her sons were nameless outcasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now relieved from all fear, Mr. Robert Beaufort entered upon the full
      enjoyment of his splendid fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house in Berkeley Square was furnished anew. Great dinners and gay
      routs were given in the ensuing spring. Mr. and Mrs. Beaufort became
      persons of considerable importance. The rich man had, even when poor, been
      ambitious; his ambition now centred in his only son. Arthur had always
      been considered a boy of talents and promise; to what might he not now
      aspire? The term of his probation with the tutor was abridged, and Arthur
      Beaufort was sent at once to Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he went to the university, during a short preparatory visit to his
      father, Arthur spoke to him of the Mortons. &ldquo;What has become of them, sir?
      and what have you done for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done for them!&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, opening his eyes. &ldquo;What should I do
      for persons who have just been harassing me with the most unprincipled
      litigation? My conduct to them has been too generous: that is, all things
      considered. But when you are my age you will find there is very little
      gratitude in the world, Arthur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, sir,&rdquo; said Arthur, with the good nature that belonged to him:
      &ldquo;still, my uncle was greatly attached to them; and the boys, at least, are
      guiltless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; replied Mr. Beaufort, a little impatiently; &ldquo;I believe they
      want for nothing: I fancy they are with the mother&rsquo;s relations. Whenever
      they address me in a proper manner they shall not find me revengeful or
      hardhearted; but, since we are on this topic,&rdquo; continued the father
      smoothing his shirt-frill with a care that showed his decorum even in
      trifles, &ldquo;I hope you see the results of that kind of connection, and that
      you will take warning by your poor uncle&rsquo;s example. And now let us change
      the subject; it is not a very pleasant one, and, at your age, the less
      your thoughts turn on such matters the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Beaufort, with the careless generosity of youth, that gauges other
      men&rsquo;s conduct by its own sentiments, believed that his father, who had
      never been niggardly to himself, had really acted as his words implied;
      and, engrossed by the pursuits of the new and brilliant career opened,
      whether to his pleasures or his studies, suffered the objects of his
      inquiries to pass from his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mrs. Morton, for by that name we must still call her, and her
      children, were settled in a small lodging in a humble suburb; situated on
      the high road between Fernside and the metropolis. She saved from her
      hopeless law-suit, after the sale of her jewels and ornaments, a
      sufficient sum to enable her, with economy, to live respectably for a year
      or two at least, during which time she might arrange her plans for the
      future. She reckoned, as a sure resource, upon the assistance of her
      relations; but it was one to which she applied with natural shame and
      reluctance. She had kept up a correspondence with her father during his
      life. To him, she never revealed the secret of her marriage, though she
      did not write like a person conscious of error. Perhaps, as she always
      said to her son, she had made to her husband a solemn promise never to
      divulge or even hint that secret until he himself should authorise its
      disclosure. For neither he nor Catherine ever contemplated separation or
      death. Alas! how all of us, when happy, sleep secure in the dark shadows,
      which ought to warn us of the sorrows that are to come! Still Catherine&rsquo;s
      father, a man of coarse mind and not rigid principles, did not take much
      to heart that connection which he assumed to be illicit. She was provided
      for, that was some comfort: doubtless Mr. Beaufort would act like a
      gentleman, perhaps at last make her an honest woman and a lady. Meanwhile,
      she had a fine house, and a fine carriage, and fine servants; and so far
      from applying to him for money, was constantly sending him little
      presents. But Catherine only saw, in his permission of her correspondence,
      kind, forgiving, and trustful affection, and she loved him tenderly: when
      he died, the link that bound her to her family was broken. Her brother
      succeeded to the trade; a man of probity and honour, but somewhat hard and
      unamiable. In the only letter she had received from him&mdash;the one
      announcing her father&rsquo;s death&mdash;he told her plainly, and very
      properly, that he could not countenance the life she led; that he had
      children growing up&mdash;that all intercourse between them was at an end,
      unless she left Mr. Beaufort; when, if she sincerely repented, he would
      still prove her affectionate brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Catherine had at the time resented this letter as unfeeling&mdash;now,
      humbled and sorrow-stricken, she recognised the propriety of principle
      from which it emanated. Her brother was well off for his station&mdash;she
      would explain to him her real situation&mdash;he would believe her story.
      She would write to him, and beg him at least to give aid to her poor
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this step she did not take till a considerable portion of her pittance
      was consumed&mdash;till nearly three parts of a year since Beaufort&rsquo;s
      death had expired&mdash;and till sundry warnings, not to be lightly
      heeded, had made her forebode the probability of an early death for
      herself. From the age of sixteen, when she had been placed by Mr. Beaufort
      at the head of his household, she had been cradled, not in extravagance,
      but in an easy luxury, which had not brought with it habits of economy and
      thrift. She could grudge anything to herself, but to her children&mdash;his
      children, whose every whim had been anticipated, she had not the heart to
      be saving. She could have starved in a garret had she been alone; but she
      could not see them wanting a comfort while she possessed a guinea. Philip,
      to do him justice, evinced a consideration not to have been expected from
      his early and arrogant recklessness. But Sidney, who could expect
      consideration from such a child? What could he know of the change of
      circumstances&mdash;of the value of money? Did he seem dejected, Catherine
      would steal out and spend a week&rsquo;s income on the lapful of toys which she
      brought home. Did he seem a shade more pale&mdash;did he complain of the
      slightest ailment, a doctor must be sent for. Alas! her own ailments,
      neglected and unheeded, were growing beyond the reach of medicine. Anxious&mdash;
      fearful&mdash;gnawed by regret for the past&mdash;the thought of famine in
      the future&mdash;she daily fretted and wore herself away. She had
      cultivated her mind during her secluded residence with Mr. Beaufort, but
      she had learned none of the arts by which decayed gentlewomen keep the
      wolf from the door; no little holiday accomplishments, which, in the day
      of need turn to useful trade; no water-colour drawings, no paintings on
      velvet, no fabrications of pretty gewgaws, no embroidery and fine
      needlework. She was helpless&mdash;utterly helpless; if she had resigned
      herself to the thought of service, she would not have had the physical
      strength for a place of drudgery, and where could she have found the
      testimonials necessary for a place of trust? A great change, at this time,
      was apparent in Philip. Had he fallen, then, into kind hands, and under
      guiding eyes, his passions and energies might have ripened into rare
      qualities and great virtues. But perhaps as Goethe has somewhere said,
      &ldquo;Experience, after all, is the best teacher.&rdquo; He kept a constant guard on
      his vehement temper&mdash;his wayward will; he would not have vexed his
      mother for the world. But, strange to say (it was a great mystery in the
      woman&rsquo;s heart), in proportion as he became more amiable, it seemed that
      his mother loved him less. Perhaps she did not, in that change, recognise
      so closely the darling of the old time; perhaps the very weaknesses and
      importunities of Sidney, the hourly sacrifices the child entailed upon
      her, endeared the younger son more to her from that natural sense of
      dependence and protection which forms the great bond between mother and
      child; perhaps too, as Philip had been one to inspire as much pride as
      affection, so the pride faded away with the expectations that had fed it,
      and carried off in its decay some of the affection that was intertwined
      with it. However this be, Philip had formerly appeared the more spoiled
      and favoured of the two: and now Sidney seemed all in all. Thus, beneath
      the younger son&rsquo;s caressing gentleness, there grew up a certain regard for
      self; it was latent, it took amiable colours; it had even a certain charm
      and grace in so sweet a child, but selfishness it was not the less. In
      this he differed from his brother. Philip was self-willed: Sidney
      self-loving. A certain timidity of character, endearing perhaps to the
      anxious heart of a mother, made this fault in the younger boy more likely
      to take root. For, in bold natures, there is a lavish and uncalculating
      recklessness which scorns self unconsciously and though there is a fear
      which arises from a loving heart, and is but sympathy for others&mdash;the
      fear which belongs to a timid character is but egotism&mdash;but, when
      physical, the regard for one&rsquo;s own person: when moral, the anxiety for
      one&rsquo;s own interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in a small room in a lodging-house in the suburb of H&mdash;&mdash;
      that Mrs. Morton was seated by the window, nervously awaiting the knock of
      the postman, who was expected to bring her brother&rsquo;s reply to her letter.
      It was therefore between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;a morning in the
      merry month of June. It was hot and sultry, which is rare in an English
      June. A flytrap, red, white, and yellow, suspended from the ceiling,
      swarmed with flies; flies were on the ceiling, flies buzzed at the
      windows; the sofa and chairs of horsehair seemed stuffed with flies. There
      was an air of heated discomfort in the thick, solid moreen curtains, in
      the gaudy paper, in the bright-staring carpet, in the very looking-glass
      over the chimney-piece, where a strip of mirror lay imprisoned in an
      embrace of frame covered with yellow muslin. We may talk of the dreariness
      of winter; and winter, no doubt, is desolate: but what in the world is
      more dreary to eyes inured to the verdure and bloom of Nature&mdash;,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">"The pomp of groves and garniture of fields,"</pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;than a close room in a suburban lodging-house; the sun piercing
      every corner; nothing fresh, nothing cool, nothing fragrant to be seen,
      felt, or inhaled; all dust, glare, noise, with a chandler&rsquo;s shop, perhaps,
      next door? Sidney armed with a pair of scissors, was cutting the pictures
      out of a story-book, which his mother had bought him the day before.
      Philip, who, of late, had taken much to rambling about the streets&mdash;it
      may be, in hopes of meeting one of those benevolent, eccentric, elderly
      gentlemen, he had read of in old novels, who suddenly come to the relief
      of distressed virtue; or, more probably, from the restlessness that
      belonged to his adventurous temperament;&mdash;Philip had left the house
      since breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! how hot this nasty room is!&rdquo; exclaimed Sidney, abruptly, looking up
      from his employment. &ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we ever go into the country, again, mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at present, my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could have my pony; why can&rsquo;t I have my pony, mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&mdash;because&mdash;the pony is sold, Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sold it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very naughty man, my uncle: is he not? But can&rsquo;t I have another
      pony? It would be so nice, this fine weather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear, I wish I could afford it: but you shall have a ride this
      week! Yes,&rdquo; continued the mother, as if reasoning with herself, in excuse
      of the extravagance, &ldquo;he does not look well: poor child! he must have
      exercise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ride!&mdash;oh! that is my own kind mamma!&rdquo; exclaimed Sidney, clapping
      his hands. &ldquo;Not on a donkey, you know!&mdash;a pony. The man down the
      street, there, lets ponies. I must have the white pony with the long tail.
      But, I say, mamma, don&rsquo;t tell Philip, pray don&rsquo;t; he would be jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not jealous, my dear; why do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is always angry when I ask you for anything. It is very unkind
      in him, for I don&rsquo;t care if he has a pony, too,&mdash;only not the white
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the postman&rsquo;s knock, loud and sudden, started Mrs. Morton from her
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her hands tightly to her heart, as if to still its beating,
      and went tremulously to the door; thence to the stairs, to anticipate the
      lumbering step of the slipshod maidservent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it me, Jane; give it me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One shilling and eightpence&mdash;double charged&mdash;if you please,
      ma&rsquo;am! Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, may I tell Jane to engage the pony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, my love; sit down; be quiet: I&mdash;I am not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidney, who was affectionate and obedient, crept back peaceably to the
      window, and, after a short, impatient sigh, resumed the scissors and the
      story-book. I do not apologise to the reader for the various letters I am
      obliged to lay before him; for character often betrays itself more in
      letters than in speech. Mr. Roger Morton&rsquo;s reply was couched in these
      terms,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR CATHERINE, I have received your letter of the 14th inst., and write
      per return. I am very much grieved to hear of your afflictions; but,
      whatever you say, I cannot think the late Mr. Beaufort acted like a
      conscientious man, in forgetting to make his will, and leaving his little
      ones destitute. It is all very well to talk of his intentions; but the
      proof of the pudding is in the eating. And it is hard upon me, who have a
      large family of my own, and get my livelihood by honest industry, to have
      a rich gentleman&rsquo;s children to maintain. As for your story about the
      private marriage, it may or not be. Perhaps you were taken in by that
      worthless man, for a real marriage it could not be. And, as you say, the
      law has decided that point; therefore, the less you say on the matter the
      better. It all comes to the same thing. People are not bound to believe
      what can&rsquo;t be proved. And even if what you say is true, you are more to be
      blamed than pitied for holding your tongue so many years, and discrediting
      an honest family, as ours has always been considered. I am sure my wife
      would not have thought of such a thing for the finest gentleman that ever
      wore shoe-leather. However, I don&rsquo;t want to hurt your feelings; and I am
      sure I am ready to do whatever is right and proper. You cannot expect that
      I should ask you to my house. My wife, you know, is a very religious woman&mdash;what
      is called evangelical; but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there: I deal with all
      people, churchmen and dissenters&mdash;even Jews,&mdash;and don&rsquo;t trouble
      my head much about differences in opinion. I dare say there are many ways
      to heaven; as I said, the other day, to Mr. Thwaites, our member. But it
      is right to say my wife will not hear of your coming here; and, indeed, it
      might do harm to my business, for there are several elderly single
      gentlewomen, who buy flannel for the poor at my shop, and they are very
      particular; as they ought to be, indeed: for morals are very strict in
      this county, and particularly in this town, where we certainly do pay very
      high church-rates. Not that I grumble; for, though I am as liberal as any
      man, I am for an established church; as I ought to be, since the dean is
      my best customer. With regard to yourself I inclose you L10., and you will
      let me know when it is gone, and I will see what more I can do. You say
      you are very poorly, which I am sorry to hear; but you must pluck up your
      spirits, and take in plain work; and I really think you ought to apply to
      Mr. Robert Beaufort. He bears a high character; and notwithstanding your
      lawsuit, which I cannot approve of, I dare say he might allow you L40. or
      L50. a-year, if you apply properly, which would be the right thing in him.
      So much for you. As for the boys&mdash;poor, fatherless creatures!&mdash;it
      is very hard that they should be so punished for no fault of their own;
      and my wife, who, though strict, is a good-hearted woman, is ready and
      willing to do what I wish about them. You say the eldest is near sixteen
      and well come on in his studies. I can get him a very good thing in a
      light genteel way. My wife&rsquo;s brother, Mr. Christopher Plaskwith, is a
      bookseller and stationer with pretty practice, in R&mdash;&mdash;. He is a
      clever man, and has a newspaper, which he kindly sends me every week; and,
      though it is not my county, it has some very sensible views and is often
      noticed in the London papers, as &lsquo;our provincial contemporary.&rsquo;&mdash;Mr.
      Plaskwith owes me some money, which I advanced him when he set up the
      paper; and he has several times most honestly offered to pay me, in shares
      in the said paper. But, as the thing might break, and I don&rsquo;t like
      concerns I don&rsquo;t understand, I have not taken advantage of his very
      handsome proposals. Now, Plaskwith wrote me word, two days ago, that he
      wanted a genteel, smart lad, as assistant and &lsquo;prentice, and offered to
      take my eldest boy; but we can&rsquo;t spare him. I write to Christopher by this
      post; and if your youth will run down on the top of the coach, and inquire
      for Mr. Plaskwith&mdash;the fare is trifling&mdash;I have no doubt he will
      be engaged at once. But you will say, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the premium to consider!&rsquo; 
      No such thing; Kit will set off the premium against his debt to me; so you
      will have nothing to pay. &lsquo;Tis a very pretty business; and the lad&rsquo;s
      education will get him on; so that&rsquo;s off your mind. As to the little chap,
      I&rsquo;ll take him at once. You say he is a pretty boy; and a pretty boy is
      always a help in a linendraper&rsquo;s shop. He shall share and share with my
      own young folks; and Mrs. Morton will take care of his washing and morals.
      I conclude&mdash;(this is Mrs. M&rsquo;s. suggestion)&mdash;that he has had the
      measles, cowpock, and whooping-cough, which please let me know. If he
      behave well, which, at his age, we can easily break him into, he is
      settled for life. So now you have got rid of two mouths to feed, and have
      nobody to think of but yourself, which must be a great comfort. Don&rsquo;t
      forget to write to Mr. Beaufort; and if he don&rsquo;t do something for you he&rsquo;s
      not the gentleman I take him for; but you are my own flesh and blood, and
      sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t starve; for, though I don&rsquo;t think it right in a man in business to
      encourage what&rsquo;s wrong, yet, when a person&rsquo;s down in the world, I think an
      ounce of help is better than a pound of preaching. My wife thinks
      otherwise, and wants to send you some tracts; but every body can&rsquo;t be as
      correct as some folks. However, as I said before, that&rsquo;s neither here nor
      there. Let me know when your boy comes down, and also about the measles,
      cowpock, and whooping-cough; also if all&rsquo;s right with Mr. Plaskwith. So
      now I hope you will feel more comfortable; and remain,
    </p>

     &ldquo;Dear Catherine,
          &ldquo;Your forgiving and affectionate brother,
                &ldquo;ROGER MORTON.
  &ldquo;High Street, N&mdash;&mdash;, June 13.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Mrs. M. says that she will be a mother to your little boy, and
      that you had better mend up all his linen before you send him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Catherine finished this epistle, she lifted her eyes and beheld Philip.
      He had entered noiselessly, and he remained silent, leaning against the
      wall, and watching the face of his mother, which crimsoned with painful
      humiliation while she read. Philip was not now the trim and dainty
      stripling first introduced to the reader. He had outgrown his faded suit
      of funereal mourning; his long-neglected hair hung elf-like and matted
      down his cheeks; there was a gloomy look in his bright dark eyes. Poverty
      never betrays itself more than in the features and form of Pride. It was
      evident that his spirit endured, rather than accommodated itself to, his
      fallen state; and, notwithstanding his soiled and threadbare garments, and
      a haggardness that ill becomes the years of palmy youth, there was about
      his whole mien and person a wild and savage grandeur more impressive than
      his former ruffling arrogance of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; said he, with a strange mixture of sternness in his
      countenance and pity in his voice; &ldquo;well, mother, and what says your
      brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You decided for us once before, decide again. But I need not ask you; you
      would never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; interrupted Philip, vaguely; &ldquo;let me see what we are to
      decide on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was naturally a woman of high courage and spirit, but sickness
      and grief had worn down both; and though Philip was but sixteen, there is
      something in the very nature of woman&mdash;especially in trouble&mdash;which
      makes her seek to lean on some other will than her own. She gave Philip
      the letter, and went quietly to sit down by Sidney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother means well,&rdquo; said Philip, when he had concluded the epistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but nothing is to be done; I cannot, cannot send poor Sidney to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
       and Mrs. Morton sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, dear mother, no; it would be terrible, indeed, to part you
      and him. But this bookseller&mdash;Plaskwith&mdash;perhaps I shall be able
      to support you both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you do not think, Philip, of being an apprentice!&mdash;you, who
      have been so brought up&mdash;you, who are so proud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I would sweep the crossings for your sake! Mother, for your sake
      I would go to my uncle Beaufort with my hat in my hand, for halfpence.
      Mother, I am not proud&mdash;I would be honest, if I can&mdash;but when I
      see you pining away, and so changed, the devil comes into me, and I often
      shudder lest I should commit some crime&mdash;what, I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Philip&mdash;my own Philip&mdash;my son, my hope, my
      firstborn!&rdquo;&mdash;and the mother&rsquo;s heart gushed forth in all the fondness
      of early days. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak so terribly, you frighten me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw her arms round his neck, and kissed him soothingly. He laid his
      burning temples on her bosom, and nestled himself to her, as he had been
      wont to do, after some stormy paroxysm of his passionate and wayward
      infancy. So there they remained&mdash;their lips silent, their hearts
      speaking to each other&mdash;each from each taking strange succour and
      holy strength&mdash;till Philip rose, calm, and with a quiet smile,
      &ldquo;Good-bye, mother; I will go at once to Mr. Plaskwith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have no money for the coach-fare; here, Philip,&rdquo; and she placed
      her purse in his hand, from which he reluctantly selected a few shillings.
      &ldquo;And mind, if the man is rude and you dislike him&mdash;mind, you must not
      subject yourself to insolence and mortification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all will go well, don&rsquo;t fear,&rdquo; said Philip, cheerfully, and he left
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening he had reached his destination. The shop was of goodly
      exterior, with a private entrance; over the shop was written, &ldquo;Christopher
      Plaskwith, Bookseller and Stationer:&rdquo; on the private door a brass plate,
      inscribed with &ldquo;R&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash; Mercury Office, Mr.
      Plaskwith.&rdquo; Philip applied at the private entrance, and was shown by a
      &ldquo;neat-handed Phillis&rdquo; into a small office-room. In a few minutes the door
      opened, and the bookseller entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Christopher Plaskwith was a short, stout man, in drab-coloured
      breeches, and gaiters to match; a black coat and waistcoat; he wore a
      large watch-chain, with a prodigious bunch of seals, alternated by small
      keys and old-fashioned mourning-rings. His complexion was pale and sodden,
      and his hair short, dark, and sleek. The bookseller valued himself on a
      likeness to Buonaparte; and affected a short, brusque, peremptory manner,
      which he meant to be the indication of the vigorous and decisive character
      of his prototype.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are the young gentleman Mr. Roger Morton recommends?&rdquo; Here Mr.
      Plaskwith took out a huge pocketbook, slowly unclasped it, staring hard at
      Philip, with what he designed for a piercing and penetrative survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the letter&mdash;no! this is Sir Thomas Champerdown&rsquo;s order for
      fifty copies of the last Mercury, containing his speech at the county
      meeting. Your age, young man?&mdash;only sixteen?&mdash;look older;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      not it&mdash;that&rsquo;s not it&mdash;and this is it!&mdash;sit down. Yes, Mr.
      Roger Morton recommends you&mdash;a relation&mdash;unfortunate
      circumstances&mdash;well educated&mdash;hum! Well, young man, what have
      you to say for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you cast accounts?&mdash;know bookkeeping?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know something of algebra, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Algebra!&mdash;oh, what else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;French and Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&mdash;may be useful. Why do you wear your hair so long?&mdash;look
      at mine. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Philip Morton, you have an intelligent countenance&mdash;I go a great
      deal by countenances. You know the terms?&mdash;most favourable to you. No
      premium&mdash;I settle that with Roger. I give board and bed&mdash;find
      your own washing. Habits regular&mdash;&lsquo;prenticeship only five years; when
      over, must not set up in the same town. I will see to the indentures. When
      can you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you please, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day after to-morrow, by six o&rsquo;clock coach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;will there be no salary? something, ever so
      small, that I could send to my another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salary, at sixteen?&mdash;board and bed&mdash;no premium! Salary, what
      for? &lsquo;Prentices have no salary!&mdash;you will have every comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me less comfort, that I may give my mother more;&mdash;a little
      money, ever so little, and take it out of my board: I can do with one meal
      a day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bookseller was moved: he took a huge pinch of snuff out of his
      waistcoat pocket, and mused a moment. He then said, as he re-examined
      Philip:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, young man, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we will do. You shall come here first
      upon trial;&mdash;see if we like each other before we sign the indentures;
      allow you, meanwhile, five shillings a week. If you show talent, will see
      if I and Roger can settle about some little allowance. That do, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir, yes,&rdquo; said Philip, gratefully. &ldquo;Agreed, then. Follow me&mdash;present
      you to Mrs. P.&rdquo; Thus saying, Mr. Plaskwith returned the letter to the
      pocket-book, and the pocket-book to the pocket; and, putting his arms
      behind his coat tails, threw up his chin, and strode through the passage
      into a small parlour, that locked upon a small garden. Here, seated round
      the table, were a thin lady, with a squint (Mrs. Plaskwith), two little
      girls, the Misses Plaskwith, also with squints, and pinafores; a young man
      of three or four-and-twenty, in nankeen trousers, a little the worse for
      washing, and a black velveteen jacket and waistcoat. This young gentleman
      was very much freckled; wore his hair, which was dark and wiry, up at one
      side, down at the other; had a short thick nose; full lips; and, when
      close to him, smelt of cigars. Such was Mr. Plimmins, Mr. Plaskwith&rsquo;s
      factotum, foreman in the shop, assistant editor to the Mercury. Mr.
      Plaskwith formally went the round of the introduction; Mrs. P. nodded her
      head; the Misses P. nudged each other, and grinned; Mr. Plimmins passed
      his hand through his hair, glanced at the glass, and bowed very politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mrs. P., my second cup, and give Mr. Morton his dish of tea. Must be
      tired, sir&mdash;hot day. Jemima, ring&mdash;no, go to the stairs and call
      out &lsquo;more buttered toast.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the shorter way&mdash;promptitude is my
      rule in life, Mr. Morton. Pray-hum, hum&mdash;have you ever, by chance,
      studied the biography of the great Napoleon Buonaparte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Plimmins gulped down his tea, and kicked Philip under the table.
      Philip looked fiercely at the foreman, and replied, sullenly, &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity. Napoleon Buonaparte was a very great man,&mdash;very! You
      have seen his cast?&mdash;there it is, on the dumb waiter! Look at it! see
      a likeness, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Likeness, sir? I never saw Napoleon Buonaparte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw him! No, just look round the room. Who does that bust put you
      in mind of? who does it resemble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Plaskwith rose, and placed himself in an attitude; his hand in
      his waistcoat, and his face pensively inclined towards the tea-table. &ldquo;Now
      fancy me at St. Helena; this table is the ocean. Now, then, who is that
      cast like, Mr. Philip Morton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, sir, it is like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that it is! strikes every one! Does it not, Mrs. P., does it not? And
      when you have known me longer, you will find a moral similitude&mdash;a
      moral, sir! Straightforward&mdash;short&mdash;to the point&mdash;bold&mdash;determined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, Mr. P.!&rdquo; said Mrs. Plaskwith, very querulously, &ldquo;do make haste
      with your tea; the young gentleman, I suppose, wants to go home, and the
      coach passes in a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Kean in Richard the Third, Mr. Morton?&rdquo; asked Mr. Plimmins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen a play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never seen a play! How very odd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all odd, Mr. Plimmins,&rdquo; said the stationer. &ldquo;Mr. Morton has known
      troubles&mdash;so hand him the hot toast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silent and morose, but rather disdainful than sad, Philip listened to the
      babble round him, and observed the ungenial characters with which he was
      to associate. He cared not to please (that, alas! had never been
      especially his study); it was enough for him if he could see, stretching
      to his mind&rsquo;s eye beyond the walls of that dull room, the long vistas into
      fairer fortune. At sixteen, what sorrow can freeze the Hope, or what
      prophetic fear whisper, &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; to the Ambition? He would bear back into
      ease and prosperity, if not into affluence and station, the dear ones left
      at home. From the eminence of five shillings a week, he looked over the
      Promised Land.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, Mr. Plaskwith, pulling out his watch, said, &ldquo;Just in time to
      catch the coach; make your bow and be off&mdash;smart&rsquo;s the word!&rdquo; Philip
      rose, took up his hat, made a stiff bow that included the whole group, and
      vanished with his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Plaskwith breathed more easily when he was gone. &ldquo;I never seed a more
      odd, fierce, ill-bred-looking young man! I declare I am quite afraid of
      him. What an eye he has!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncommonly dark; what I may say gipsy-like,&rdquo; said Mr. Plimmins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! he! You always do say such good things, Plimmins. Gipsy-like, he! he!
      So he is! I wonder if he can tell fortunes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be long before he has a fortune of his own to tell. Ha! ha!&rdquo; said
      Plimmins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! he! how very good! you are so pleasant, Plimmins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While these strictures on his appearance were still going on, Philip had
      already ascended the roof of the coach; and, waving his hand, with the
      condescension of old times, to his future master, was carried away by the
      &ldquo;Express&rdquo; in a whirlwind of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very warm evening, sir,&rdquo; said a passenger seated at his right; puffing,
      while he spoke, from a short German pipe, a volume of smoke in Philip&rsquo;s
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very warm. Be so good as to smoke into the face of the gentleman on the
      other side of you,&rdquo; returned Philip, petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; replied the passenger, with a loud, powerful laugh&mdash;the
      laugh of a strong man. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t take to the pipe yet; you will by and
      by, when you have known the cares and anxieties that I have gone through.
      A pipe!&mdash;it is a great soother!&mdash;a pleasant comforter! Blue
      devils fly before its honest breath! It ripens the brain&mdash;it opens
      the heart; and the man who smokes thinks like a sage and acts like a
      Samaritan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roused from his reverie by this quaint and unexpected declamation, Philip
      turned his quick glance at his neighbour. He saw a man of great bulk and
      immense physical power&mdash;broad-shouldered&mdash;deep-chested&mdash;not
      corpulent, but taking the same girth from bone and muscle that a corpulent
      man does from flesh. He wore a blue coat&mdash;frogged, braided, and
      buttoned to the throat. A broad-brimmed straw hat, set on one side, gave a
      jaunty appearance to a countenance which, notwithstanding its jovial
      complexion and smiling mouth, had, in repose, a bold and decided
      character. It was a face well suited to the frame, inasmuch as it
      betokened a mind capable of wielding and mastering the brute physical
      force of body;&mdash;light eyes of piercing intelligence; rough, but
      resolute and striking features, and a jaw of iron. There was thought,
      there was power, there was passion in the shaggy brow, the deep-ploughed
      lines, the dilated, nostril and the restless play of the lips. Philip
      looked hard and grave, and the man returned his look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of me, young gentleman?&rdquo; asked the passenger, as he
      replaced the pipe in his mouth. &ldquo;I am a fine-looking man, am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem a strange one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange!&mdash;Ay, I puzzle you, as I have done, and shall do, many. You
      cannot read me as easily as I can read you. Come, shall I guess at your
      character and circumstances? You are a gentleman, or something like it, by
      birth;&mdash;that the tone of your voice tells me. You are poor, devilish
      poor;&mdash;that the hole in your coat assures me. You are proud, fiery,
      discontented, and unhappy;&mdash;all that I see in your face. It was
      because I saw those signs that I spoke to you. I volunteer no acquaintance
      with the happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say not; for if you know all the unhappy you must have a
      sufficiently large acquaintance,&rdquo; returned Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wit is beyond your years! What is your calling, if the question does
      not offend you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none as yet,&rdquo; said Philip, with a slight sigh, and a deep blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More&rsquo;s the pity!&rdquo; grunted the smoker, with a long emphatic nasal
      intonation. &ldquo;I should have judged that you were a raw recruit in the camp
      of the enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enemy! I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, a plant growing out of a lawyer&rsquo;s desk. I will explain.
      There is one class of spiders, industrious, hard-working octopedes, who,
      out of the sweat of their brains (I take it, by the by, that a spider must
      have a fine craniological development), make their own webs and catch
      their flies. There is another class of spiders who have no stuff in them
      wherewith to make webs; they, therefore, wander about, looking out for
      food provided by the toil of their neighbours. Whenever they come to the
      web of a smaller spider, whose larder seems well supplied, they rush upon
      his domain&mdash;pursue him to his hole&mdash;eat him up if they can&mdash;reject
      him if he is too tough for their maws, and quietly possess themselves of
      all the legs and wings they find dangling in his meshes: these spiders I
      call enemies&mdash;the world calls them lawyers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip laughed: &ldquo;And who are the first class of spiders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest creatures who openly confess that they live upon flies. Lawyers
      fall foul upon them, under pretence of delivering flies from their
      clutches. They are wonderful blood-suckers, these lawyers, in spite of all
      their hypocrisy. Ha! ha! ho! ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a loud, rough chuckle, more expressive of malignity than mirth,
      the man turned himself round, applied vigorously to his pipe, and sank
      into a silence which, as mile after mile glided past the wheels, he did
      not seem disposed to break. Neither was Philip inclined to be
      communicative. Considerations for his own state and prospects swallowed up
      the curiosity he might otherwise have felt as to his singular neighbour.
      He had not touched food since the early morning. Anxiety had made him
      insensible to hunger, till he arrived at Mr. Plaskwith&rsquo;s; and then,
      feverish, sore, and sick at heart, the sight of the luxuries gracing the
      tea-table only revolted him. He did not now feel hunger, but he was
      fatigued and faint. For several nights the sleep which youth can so ill
      dispense with had been broken and disturbed; and now, the rapid motion of
      the coach, and the free current of a fresher and more exhausting air than
      he had been accustomed to for many months, began to operate on his nerves
      like the intoxication of a narcotic. His eyes grew heavy; indistinct
      mists, through which there seemed to glare the various squints of the
      female Plaskwiths, succeeded the gliding road and the dancing trees. His
      head fell on his bosom; and thence, instinctively seeking the strongest
      support at hand, inclined towards the stout smoker, and finally nestled
      itself composedly on that gentleman&rsquo;s shoulder. The passenger, feeling
      this unwelcome and unsolicited weight, took the pipe, which he had already
      thrice refilled, from his lips, and emitted an angry and impatient snort;
      finding that this produced no effect, and that the load grew heavier as
      the boy&rsquo;s sleep grew deeper, he cried, in a loud voice, &ldquo;Holla! I did not
      pay my fare to be your bolster, young man!&rdquo; and shook himself lustily.
      Philip started, and would have fallen sidelong from the coach, if his
      neighbour had not griped him hard with a hand that could have kept a young
      oak from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rouse yourself!&mdash;you might have had an ugly tumble.&rdquo; Philip muttered
      something inaudible, between sleeping and waking, and turned his dark eyes
      towards the man; in that glance there was so much unconscious, but sad and
      deep reproach, that the passenger felt touched and ashamed. Before
      however, he could say anything in apology or conciliation, Philip had
      again fallen asleep. But this time, as if he had felt and resented the
      rebuff he had received, he inclined his head away from his neighbour,
      against the edge of a box on the roof&mdash;a dangerous pillow, from which
      any sudden jolt might transfer him to the road below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lad!&mdash;he looks pale!&rdquo; muttered the man, and he knocked the weed
      from his pipe, which he placed gently in his pocket. &ldquo;Perhaps the smoke
      was too much for him&mdash;he seems ill and thin,&rdquo; and he took the boy&rsquo;s
      long lean fingers in his own. &ldquo;His cheek is hollow!&mdash;what do I know
      but it may be with fasting? Pooh! I was a brute. Hush, coachee, hush!
      don&rsquo;t talk so loud, and be d&mdash;-d to you&mdash;he will certainly be
      off!&rdquo; and the man softly and creepingly encircled the boy&rsquo;s waist with his
      huge arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, to shift his head; so-so,&mdash;that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Philip&rsquo;s sallow
      cheek and long hair were now tenderly lapped on the soliloquist&rsquo;s bosom.
      &ldquo;Poor wretch! he smiles; perhaps he is thinking of home, and the
      butterflies he ran after when he was an urchin&mdash;they never come back,
      those days;&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never! I think the wind veers to
      the east; he may catch cold;&rdquo;&mdash;and with that, the man, sliding the
      head for a moment, and with the tenderness of a woman, from his breast to
      his shoulder, unbuttoned his coat (as he replaced the weight, no longer
      unwelcomed, in its former part), and drew the lappets closely round the
      slender frame of the sleeper, exposing his own sturdy breast&mdash;for he
      wore no waistcoat&mdash;to the sharpening air. Thus cradled on that
      stranger&rsquo;s bosom, wrapped from the present and dreaming perhaps&mdash;while
      a heart scorched by fierce and terrible struggles with life and sin made
      his pillow&mdash;of a fair and unsullied future, slept the fatherless and
      friendless boy.

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Constance. My life, my joy, my food, my all the world,
   My widow-comfort.&rdquo;&mdash;King John.
</pre>
    <p>
      Amidst the glare of lamps&mdash;the rattle of carriages&mdash;the
      lumbering of carts and waggons&mdash;the throng, the clamour, the reeking
      life and dissonant roar of London, Philip woke from his happy sleep. He
      woke uncertain and confused, and saw strange eyes bent on him kindly and
      watchfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have slept well, my lad!&rdquo; said the passenger, in the deep ringing
      voice which made itself heard above all the noises around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have suffered me to incommode you thus!&rdquo; said Philip, with more
      gratitude in his voice and look than, perhaps, he had shown to any one out
      of his own family since his birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had but little kindness shown you, my poor boy, if you think so
      much of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;all people were very kind to me once. I did not value it then.&rdquo;
       Here the coach rolled heavily down the dark arch of the inn-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of yourself, my boy! You look ill;&rdquo; and in the dark the man
      slipped a sovereign into Philip&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want money. Though I thank you heartily all the same; it would be
      a shame at my age to be a beggar. But can you think of an employment where
      I can make something?&mdash;what they offer me is so trifling. I have a
      mother and a brother&mdash;a mere child, sir&mdash;at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Employment!&rdquo; repeated the man; and as the coach now stopped at the tavern
      door, the light of the lamp fell full on his marked face. &ldquo;Ay, I know of
      employment; but you should apply to some one else to obtain it for you! As
      for me, it is not likely that we shall meet again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that!&mdash;What and who are you?&rdquo; asked Philip, with a
      rude and blunt curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; returned the passenger, with his deep laugh. &ldquo;Oh! I know some people
      who call me an honest fellow. Take the employment offered you, no matter
      how trifling the wages&mdash;keep out of harm&rsquo;s way. Good night to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he quickly descended from the roof, and, as he was directing
      the coachman where to look for his carpetbag, Philip saw three or four
      well-dressed men make up to him, shake him heartily by the hand, and
      welcome him with great seeming cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip sighed. &ldquo;He has friends,&rdquo; he muttered to himself; and, paying his
      fare, he turned from the bustling yard, and took his solitary way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after his visit to R&mdash;&mdash;, Philip was settled on his
      probation at Mr. Plaskwith&rsquo;s, and Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s health was so decidedly
      worse, that she resolved to know her fate, and consult a physician. The
      oracle was at first ambiguous in its response. But when Mrs. Morton said
      firmly, &ldquo;I have duties to perform; upon your candid answer rest my Plans
      with respect to my children&mdash;left, if I die suddenly, destitute in
      the world,&rdquo;&mdash;the doctor looked hard in her face, saw its calm
      resolution, and replied frankly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lose no time, then, in arranging your plans; life is uncertain with all&mdash;with
      you, especially; you may live some time yet, but your constitution is much
      shaken&mdash;I fear there is water on the chest. No, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;no fee. I
      will see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician turned to Sidney, who played with his watch-chain, and
      smiled up in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that child, sir?&rdquo; said the mother, wistfully, forgetting the dread
      fiat pronounced against herself,&mdash;&ldquo;he is so delicate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, ma&rsquo;am,&mdash;a very fine little fellow;&rdquo; and the doctor
      patted the boy&rsquo;s head, and abruptly vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! mamma, I wish you would ride&mdash;I wish you would take the white
      pony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! poor boy!&rdquo; muttered the mother; &ldquo;I must not be selfish.&rdquo; She
      covered her face with her hands, and began to think!
    </p>
    <p>
      Could she, thus doomed, resolve on declining her brother&rsquo;s offer? Did it
      not, at least, secure bread and shelter to her child? When she was dead,
      might not a tie, between the uncle and nephew, be snapped asunder? Would
      he be as kind to the boy as now when she could commend him with her own
      lips to his care&mdash;when she could place that precious charge into his
      hands? With these thoughts, she formed one of those resolutions which have
      all the strength of self-sacrificing love. She would put the boy from her,
      her last solace and comfort; she would die alone,&mdash;alone!

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Constance. When I shall meet him in the court of heaven, I shall
   not know him.&rdquo;&mdash;King John.
</pre>
    <p>
      One evening, the shop closed and the business done, Mr. Roger Morton and
      his family sat in that snug and comfortable retreat which generally backs
      the warerooms of an English tradesman. Happy often, and indeed happy, is
      that little sanctuary, near to, and yet remote from, the toil and care of
      the busy mart from which its homely ease and peaceful security are drawn.
      Glance down those rows of silenced shops in a town at night, and picture
      the glad and quiet groups gathered within, over that nightly and social
      meal which custom has banished from the more indolent tribes who neither
      toil nor spin. Placed between the two extremes of life, the tradesman, who
      ventures not beyond his means, and sees clear books and sure gains, with
      enough of occupation to give healthful excitement, enough of fortune to
      greet each new-born child without a sigh, might be envied alike by those
      above and those below his state&mdash;if the restless heart of men ever
      envied Content!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so the little boy is not to come?&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton as she crossed
      her knife and fork, and pushed away her plate, in token that she had done
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&mdash;Children, go to bed; there&mdash;there&mdash;that
      will do. Good night!&mdash;Catherine does not say either yes or no. She
      wants time to consider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very handsome offer on our part; some folks never know when they
      are well off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very true, my dear, and you are a very sensible person. Kate
      herself might have been an honest woman, and, what is more, a very rich
      woman, by this time. She might have married Spencer, the young brewer&mdash;an
      excellent man, and well to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spencer! I don&rsquo;t remember him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: after she went off, he retired from business, and left the place. I
      don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s become of him. He was mightily taken with her, to be
      sure. She was uncommonly handsome, my sister Catherine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handsome is as handsome does, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said the wife, who was very
      much marked with the small-pox. &ldquo;We all have our temptations and trials;
      this is a vale of tears, and without grace we are whited sepulchers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton mixed his brandy and water, and moved his chair into its
      customary corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw your brother&rsquo;s letter,&rdquo; said he, after a pause; &ldquo;he gives young
      Philip a very good character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The human heart is very deceitful,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Morton, who, by the way,
      spoke through her nose. &ldquo;Pray Heaven he may be what he seems; but what&rsquo;s
      bred in the bone comes out in the flesh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must hope the best,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, mildly; &ldquo;and&mdash;put another
      lump into the grog, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a mercy, I&rsquo;m thinking, that we didn&rsquo;t have the other little boy. I
      dare say he has never even been taught his catechism: them people don&rsquo;t
      know what it is to be a mother. And, besides, it would have been very
      awkward, Mr. M.; we could never have said who he was: and I&rsquo;ve no doubt
      Miss Pryinall would have been very curious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Pryinall be &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; Mr. Morton checked himself, took a
      large draught of the brandy and water, and added, &ldquo;Miss Pryinall wants to
      have a finger in everybody&rsquo;s pie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she buys a deal of flannel, and does great good to the town; it was
      she who found out that Mrs. Giles was no better than she should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Giles!&mdash;she came to the workhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Giles, indeed! I wonder, Mr. Morton, that you, a married man
      with a family, should say, poor Mrs. Giles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, when people who have been well off come to the workhouse, they
      may be called poor:&mdash;but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there; only, if the
      boy does come to us, we must look sharp upon Miss Pryinall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t come,&mdash;it will be very unpleasant. And when a man
      has a wife and family, the less he meddles with other folks and their
      little ones, the better. For as the Scripture says, &lsquo;A man shall cleave to
      his wife and&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a sharp, shrill ring at the bell was heard, and Mrs. Morton broke off
      into:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I declare! at this hour; who can that be? And all gone to bed! Do
      go and see, Mr. Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat reluctantly and slowly, Mr. Morton rose; and, proceeding to the
      passage, unbarred the door. A brief and muttered conversation followed, to
      the great irritability of Mrs. Morton, who stood in the passage&mdash;the
      candle in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. M.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton turned back, looking agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my hat? oh, here. My sister is come, at the inn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious me! She does not go for to say she is your sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no: here&rsquo;s her note&mdash;calls herself a lady that&rsquo;s ill. I shall be
      back soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t come here&mdash;she sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t come here, Mr. M. I&rsquo;m an honest
      woman&mdash;she can&rsquo;t come here. You understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton had naturally a stern countenance, stern to every one but his
      wife. The shrill tone to which he was so long accustomed jarred then on
      his heart as well as his ear. He frowned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! woman, you have no feeling!&rdquo; said he, and walked out of the house,
      pulling his hat over his brows. That was the only rude speech Mr. Morton
      had ever made to his better half. She treasured it up in her heart and
      memory; it was associated with the sister and the child; and she was not a
      woman who ever forgave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton walked rapidly through the still, moon-lit streets, till he
      reached the inn. A club was held that night in one of the rooms below; and
      as he crossed the threshold, the sound of &ldquo;hip-hip-hurrah!&rdquo; mingled with
      the stamping of feet and the jingling of glasses, saluted his entrance. He
      was a stiff, sober, respectable man,&mdash;a man who, except at elections&mdash;he
      was a great politician&mdash;mixed in none of the revels of his more
      boisterous townsmen. The sounds, the spot, were ungenial to him. He
      paused, and the colour of shame rose to his brow. He was ashamed to be
      there&mdash;ashamed to meet the desolate and, as he believed, erring
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty maidservant, heated and flushed with orders and compliments,
      crossed his path with a tray full of glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady come by the Telegraph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, upstairs, No. 2, Mr. Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton! He shrank at the sound of his own name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;After all, this is more unpleasant than I
      thought for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slight stairs shook under his hasty tread. He opened the door of No.
      2, and that Catherine, whom he had last seen at her age of gay sixteen,
      radiant with bloom, and, but for her air of pride, the model for a Hebe,&mdash;that
      Catherine, old ere youth was gone, pale, faded, the dark hair silvered
      over, the cheeks hollow, and the eye dim,&mdash;that Catherine fell upon
      his breast!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, brother! How kind to come! How long since we have met!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Catherine, my dear sister. You are faint&mdash;you are very
      much changed&mdash;very. I should not have known you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, I have brought my boy; it is painful to part from him&mdash;very&mdash;very
      painful: but it is right, and God&rsquo;s will be done.&rdquo; She turned, as she
      spoke, towards a little, deformed rickety dwarf of a sofa, that seemed to
      hide itself in the darkest corner of the low, gloomy room; and Morton
      followed her. With one hand she removed the shawl that she had thrown over
      the child, and placing the forefinger of the other upon her lips&mdash;lips
      that smiled then&mdash;she whispered,&mdash;&ldquo;We will not wake him, he is
      so tired. But I would not put him to bed till you had seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there slept poor Sidney, his fair cheek pillowed on his arm; the soft,
      silky ringlets thrown from the delicate and unclouded brow; the natural
      bloom increased by warmth and travel; the lovely face so innocent and
      hushed; the breathing so gentle and regular, as if never broken by a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton drew his hand across his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something very touching in the contrast between that wakeful,
      anxious, forlorn woman, and the slumber of the unconscious boy. And in
      that moment, what breast upon which the light of Christian pity&mdash;of
      natural affection, had ever dawned, would, even supposing the world&rsquo;s
      judgment were true, have recalled Catherine&rsquo;s reputed error? There is so
      divine a holiness in the love of a mother, that no matter how the tie that
      binds her to the child was formed, she becomes, as it were, consecrated
      and sacred; and the past is forgotten, and the world and its harsh
      verdicts swept away, when that love alone is visible; and the God, who
      watches over the little one, sheds His smile over the human deputy, in
      whose tenderness there breathes His own!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be kind to him&mdash;will you not?&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton; and the
      appeal was made with that trustful, almost cheerful tone which implies,
      &lsquo;Who would not be kind to a thing so fair and helpless?&rsquo; &ldquo;He is very
      sensitive and very docile; you will never have occasion to say a hard word
      to him&mdash;never! you have children of your own, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a beautiful boy&mdash;beautiful. I will be a father to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke,&mdash;the recollection of his wife&mdash;sour, querulous,
      austere&mdash;came over him, but he said to himself, &ldquo;She must take to
      such a child,&mdash;women always take to beauty.&rdquo; He bent down and gently
      pressed his lips to Sidney&rsquo;s forehead: Mrs. Morton replaced the shawl, and
      drew her brother to the other end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said, colouring as she spoke, &ldquo;I must see your wife,
      brother: there is so much to say about a child that only a woman will
      recollect. Is she very good-tempered and kind, your wife? You know I never
      saw her; you married after&mdash;after I left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a very worthy woman,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, clearing his throat, &ldquo;and
      brought me some money; she has a will of her own, as most women have; but
      that&rsquo;s neither here nor there&mdash;she is a good wife as wives go; and
      prudent and painstaking&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I should do without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, I have one favour to request&mdash;a great favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything I can do in the way of money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has nothing to do with money. I can&rsquo;t live long&mdash;don&rsquo;t shake your
      head&mdash;I can&rsquo;t live long. I have no fear for Philip, he has so much
      spirit&mdash;such strength of character&mdash;but that child! I cannot
      bear to leave him altogether; let me stay in this town&mdash;I can lodge
      anywhere; but to see him sometimes&mdash;to know I shall be in reach if he
      is ill&mdash;let me stay here&mdash;let me die here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not talk so sadly&mdash;you are young yet&mdash;younger than I
      am&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think of dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid! but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Morton, who began to fear his feelings
      would hurry him into some promise which his wife would not suffer him to
      keep; &ldquo;you shall talk to Margaret,&mdash;that is Mrs. Morton&mdash;I will
      get her to see you&mdash;yes, I think I can contrive that; and if you can
      arrange with her to stay,&mdash;but you see, as she brought the money, and
      is a very particular woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see her; thank you&mdash;thank you; she cannot refuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, brother,&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Morton, after a short pause, and speaking in
      a firm voice&mdash;&ldquo;and is it possible that you disbelieve my story?&mdash;that
      you, like all the rest, consider my children the sons of shame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an honest earnestness in Catherine&rsquo;s voice, as she spoke, that
      might have convinced many. But Mr. Morton was a man of facts, a practical
      man&mdash;a man who believed that law was always right, and that the
      improbable was never true.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down as he answered, &ldquo;I think you have been a very ill-used
      woman, Catherine, and that is all I can say on the matter; let us drop the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I was not ill-used; my husband&mdash;yes, my husband&mdash;was noble
      and generous from first to last. It was for the sake of his children&rsquo;s
      prospects&mdash;for the expectations they, through him, might derive from
      his proud uncle&mdash;that he concealed our marriage. Do not blame Philip&mdash;do
      not condemn the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to blame any one,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, rather angrily; &ldquo;I am a
      plain man&mdash;a tradesman, and can only go by what in my class seems
      fair and honest, which I can&rsquo;t think Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s conduct was, put it
      how you will; if he marries you as you think, he gets rid of a witness, he
      destroys a certificate, and he dies without a will. How ever, all that&rsquo;s
      neither here nor there. You do quite right not to take the name of
      Beaufort, since it is an uncommon name, and would always make the story
      public. Least said, soonest mended. You must always consider that your
      children will be called natural children, and have their own way to make.
      No harm in that! Warm day for your journey.&rdquo; Catherine sighed, and wiped
      her eyes; she no longer reproached the world, since the son of her own
      mother disbelieved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relations talked together for some minutes on the past&mdash;the
      present; but there was embarrassment and constraint on both sides&mdash;it
      was so difficult to avoid one subject; and after sixteen years of absence,
      there is little left in common, even between those who once played
      together round their parent&rsquo;s knees. Mr. Morton was glad at last to find
      an excuse in Catherine&rsquo;s fatigue to leave her. &ldquo;Cheer up, and take a glass
      of something warm before you go to bed. Good night!&rdquo; these were his
      parting words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long was the conference, and sleepless the couch, of Mr. and Mrs. Morton.
      At first that estimable lady positively declared she would not and could
      not visit Catherine (as to receiving her, that was out of the question).
      But she secretly resolved to give up that point in order to insist with
      greater strength upon another&mdash;viz., the impossibility of Catherine
      remaining in the town; such concession for the purpose of resistance being
      a very common and sagacious policy with married ladies. Accordingly, when
      suddenly, and with a good grace, Mrs. Morton appeared affected by her
      husband&rsquo;s eloquence, and said, &ldquo;Well, poor thing! if she is so ill, and
      you wish it so much, I will call to-morrow,&rdquo; Mr. Morton felt his heart
      softened towards the many excellent reasons which his wife urged against
      allowing Catherine to reside in the town. He was a political character&mdash;he
      had many enemies; the story of his seduced sister, now forgotten, would
      certainly be raked up; it would affect his comfort, perhaps his trade,
      certainly his eldest daughter, who was now thirteen; it would be
      impossible then to adopt the plan hitherto resolved upon&mdash;of passing
      off Sidney as the legitimate orphan of a distant relation; it would be
      made a great handle for gossip by Miss Pryinall. Added to all these
      reasons, one not less strong occurred to Mr. Morton himself&mdash;the
      uncommon and merciless rigidity of his wife would render all the other
      women in the town very glad of any topic that would humble her own sense
      of immaculate propriety. Moreover, he saw that if Catherine did remain, it
      would be a perpetual source of irritation in his own home; he was a man
      who liked an easy life, and avoided, as far as possible, all food for
      domestic worry. And thus, when at length the wedded pair turned back to
      back, and composed themselves to sleep, the conditions of peace were
      settled, and the weaker party, as usual in diplomacy, sacrificed to the
      interests of the united powers. After breakfast the next morning, Mrs.
      Morton sallied out on her husband&rsquo;s arm. Mr. Morton was rather a handsome
      man, with an air and look grave, composed, severe, that had tended much to
      raise his character in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton was short, wiry, and bony. She had won her husband by making
      desperate love to him, to say nothing of a dower that enabled him to
      extend his business, new-front, as well as new-stock his shop, and rise
      into the very first rank of tradesmen in his native town. He still
      believed that she was excessively fond of him&mdash;a common delusion of
      husbands, especially when henpecked. Mrs. Morton was, perhaps, fond of him
      in her own way; for though her heart was not warm, there may be a great
      deal of fondness with very little feeling. The worthy lady was now clothed
      in her best. She had a proper pride in showing the rewards that belong to
      female virtue. Flowers adorned her Leghorn bonnet, and her green silk gown
      boasted four flounces,&mdash;such, then, was, I am told, the fashion. She
      wore, also, a very handsome black shawl, extremely heavy, though the day
      was oppressively hot, and with a deep border; a smart sevigni brooch of
      yellow topazes glittered in her breast; a huge gilt serpent glared from
      her waistband; her hair, or more properly speaking her front, was tortured
      into very tight curls, and her feet into very tight half-laced boots, from
      which the fragrance of new leather had not yet departed. It was this last
      infliction, for <i>il faut souffrir pour etre belle</i>, which somewhat
      yet more acerbated the ordinary acid of Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s temper. The sweetest
      disposition is ruffled when the shoe pinches; and it so happened that Mrs.
      Roger Morton was one of those ladies who always have chilblains in the
      winter and corns in the summer. &ldquo;So you say your sister is a beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was a beauty, Mrs. M.,&mdash;was a beauty. People alter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bad conscience, Mr. Morton, is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, can&rsquo;t you walk faster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had my corns, Mr. Morton, you would not talk in that way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The happy pair sank into silence, only broken by sundry &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye dos?&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Good mornings!&rdquo; interchanged with their friends, till they arrived at
      the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go up quickly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      And quiet&mdash;quiet to gloom, did the inn, so noisy overnight, seem by
      morning. The shutters partially closed to keep out the sun&mdash;the
      taproom deserted&mdash;the passage smelling of stale smoke&mdash;an
      elderly dog, lazily snapping at the flies, at the foot of the staircase&mdash;not
      a soul to be seen at the bar. The husband and wife, glad to be unobserved,
      crept on tiptoe up the stairs, and entered Catherine&rsquo;s apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catherine was seated on the sofa, and Sidney-dressed, like Mrs. Roger
      Morton, to look his prettiest, nor yet aware of the change that awaited
      his destiny, but pleased at the excitement of seeing new friends, as
      handsome children sure of praise and petting usually are&mdash;stood by
      her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife&mdash;Catherine,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. Catherine rose eagerly, and
      gazed searchingly on her sister-in-law&rsquo;s hard face. She swallowed the
      convulsive rising at her heart as she gazed, and stretched out both her
      hands, not so much to welcome as to plead. Mrs. Roger Morton drew herself
      up, and then dropped a courtesy&mdash;it was an involuntary piece of good
      breeding&mdash;it was extorted by the noble countenance, the matronly mien
      of Catherine, different from what she had anticipated&mdash;she dropped
      the courtesy, and Catherine took her hand and pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my son;&rdquo; she turned away her head. Sidney advanced towards his
      protectress who was to be, and Mrs. Roger muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, my dear! A fine little boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As fine a child as ever I saw!&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, heartily, as he took
      Sidney on his lap, and stroked down his golden hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      This displeased Mrs. Roger Morton, but she sat herself down, and said it
      was &ldquo;very warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now go to that lady, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. &ldquo;Is she not a very nice
      lady?&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think you shall like her very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidney, the best-mannered child in the world, went boldly up to Mrs.
      Morton, as he was bid. Mrs. Morton was embarrassed. Some folks are so with
      other folk&rsquo;s children: a child either removes all constraint from a party,
      or it increases the constraint tenfold. Mrs. Morton, however, forced a
      smile, and said, &ldquo;I have a little boy at home about your age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; exclaimed Catherine, eagerly; and as if that confession made
      them friends at once, she drew a chair close to her sister-in-law&rsquo;s,&mdash;&ldquo;My
      brother has told you all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall stay here&mdash;in the town somewhere&mdash;and see him
      sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roger Morton glanced at her husband&mdash;her husband glanced at the
      door&mdash;and Catherine&rsquo;s quick eye turned from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morton will explain, ma&rsquo; am,&rdquo; said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;E-hem!&mdash;Catherine, my dear, I am afraid that is out of the
      question,&rdquo; began Mr. Morton, who, when fairly put to it, could be
      business-like enough. &ldquo;You see bygones are bygones, and it is no use
      raking them up. But many people in the town will recollect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one will see me&mdash;no one, but you and Sidney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be sure to creep out; won&rsquo;t it, Mrs. Morton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure. Indeed, ma&rsquo;am, it is impossible. Mr. Morton is so very
      respectable, and his neighbours pay so much attention to all he does; and
      then, if we have an election in the autumn, you see, ma&rsquo;am, he has a great
      stake in the place, and is a public character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. &ldquo;But I say, Catherine,
      can your little boy go into the other room for a moment? Margaret, suppose
      you take him and make friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delighted to throw on her husband the burden of explanation, which she had
      originally meant to have all the importance of giving herself in her most
      proper and patronising manner, Mrs. Morton twisted her fingers into the
      boy&rsquo;s hand, and, opening the door that communicated with the bedroom, left
      the brother and sister alone. And then Mr. Morton, with more tact and
      delicacy than might have been expected from him, began to soften to
      Catherine the hardship of the separation he urged. He dwelt principally on
      what was best for the child. Boys were so brutal in their intercourse with
      each other. He had even thought it better represent Philip to Mr.
      Plaskwith as a more distant relation than he was; and he begged, by the
      by, that Catherine would tell Philip to take the hint. But as for Sidney,
      sooner or later, he would go to a day-school&mdash;have companions of his
      own age&mdash;if his birth were known, he would be exposed to many
      mortifications&mdash;so much better, and so very easy, to bring him up as
      the lawful, that is the legal, offspring of some distant relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; cried poor Catherine, clasping her bands, &ldquo;when I am dead, is he
      never to know that I was his mother?&rdquo; The anguish of that question
      thrilled the heart of the listener. He was affected below all the surface
      that worldly thoughts and habits had laid, stratum by stratum, over the
      humanities within. He threw his arms round Catherine, and strained her to
      his breast:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my sister&mdash;my poor sister&mdash;he shall know it when he is old
      enough to understand, and to keep his own secret. He shall know, too, how
      we all loved and prized you once; how young you were, how flattered and
      tempted; how you were deceived, for I know that&mdash;on my soul I do&mdash;I
      know it was not your fault. He shall know, too, how fondly you loved your
      child, and how you sacrificed, for his sake, the very comfort of being
      near him. He shall know it all&mdash;all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother&mdash;my brother, I resign him&mdash;I am content. God reward
      you. I will go&mdash;go quickly. I know you will take care of him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Morton, re-settling himself, and wiping his
      eyes, &ldquo;it is best, between you and me, that Mrs. Morton should have her
      own way in this. She is a very good woman&mdash;very; but it&rsquo;s prudent not
      to vex her. You may come in now, Mrs. Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton and Sidney reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have settled it all,&rdquo; said the husband. &ldquo;When can we have him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; said Mrs. Roger Morton; &ldquo;you see, ma&rsquo;am, we must get his bed
      ready, and his sheets well aired: I am very particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly. Will he sleep alone?&mdash;pardon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall have a room to himself,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. &ldquo;Eh, my dear? Next to
      Martha&rsquo;s. Martha is our parlourmaid&mdash;very good-natured girl, and fond
      of children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton looked grave, thought a moment, and said, &ldquo;Yes, he can have
      that room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can have that room?&rdquo; asked Sidney, innocently. &ldquo;You, my dear,&rdquo;
       replied Mr. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where will mamma sleep? I must sleep near mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma is going away,&rdquo; said Catherine, in a firm voice, in which the
      despair would only have been felt by the acute ear of sympathy,&mdash;&ldquo;going
      away for a little time: but this gentleman and lady will be very&mdash;very
      kind to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will do our best, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she spoke, a sudden light broke on the boy&rsquo;s mind&mdash;he uttered
      a loud cry, broke from his aunt, rushed to his mother&rsquo;s breast, and hid
      his face there, sobbing bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he has been very much spoiled,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Roger Morton.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need stay longer&mdash;it will look suspicious. Good
      morning, ma&rsquo;am: we shall be ready to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Catherine,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton; and he added, as he kissed her,
      &ldquo;Be of good heart, I will come up by myself and spend the evening with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the night after this interview. Sidney had gone to his new home;
      they had been all kind to him&mdash;Mr. Morton, the children, Martha the
      parlour-maid. Mrs. Roger herself had given him a large slice of bread and
      jam, but had looked gloomy all the rest of the evening: because, like a
      dog in a strange place, he refused to eat. His little heart was full, and
      his eyes, swimming with tears, were turned at every moment to the door.
      But he did not show the violent grief that might have been expected. His
      very desolation, amidst the unfamiliar faces, awed and chilled him. But
      when Martha took him to bed, and undressed him, and he knelt down to say
      his prayers, and came to the words, &ldquo;Pray God bless dear mamma, and make
      me a good child,&rdquo; his heart could contain its load no longer, and he
      sobbed with a passion that alarmed the good-natured servant. She had been
      used, however, to children, and she soothed and caressed him, and told him
      of all the nice things he would do, and the nice toys he would have; and
      at last, silenced, if not convinced, his eyes closed, and, the tears yet
      wet on their lashes, he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been arranged that Catherine should return home that night by a
      late coach, which left the town at twelve. It was already past eleven.
      Mrs. Morton had retired to bed; and her husband, who had, according to his
      wont, lingered behind to smoke a cigar over his last glass of brandy and
      water, had just thrown aside the stump, and was winding up his watch, when
      he heard a low tap at his window. He stood mute and alarmed, for the
      window opened on a back lane, dark and solitary at night, and, from the
      heat of the weather, the iron-cased shutter was not yet closed; the sound
      was repeated, and he heard a faint voice. He glanced at the poker, and
      then cautiously moved to the window, and looked forth,&mdash;&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I&mdash;it is Catherine! I cannot go without seeing my boy. I must
      see him&mdash;I must, once more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister, the place is shut up&mdash;it is impossible. God bless
      me, if Mrs. Morton should hear you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have walked before this window for hours&mdash;I have waited till all
      is hushed in your house, till no one, not even a menial, need see the
      mother stealing to the bed of her child. Brother, by the memory of our own
      mother, I command you to let me look, for the last time, upon my boy&rsquo;s
      face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Catherine said this, standing in that lonely street&mdash;darkness and
      solitude below, God and the stars above&mdash;there was about her a
      majesty which awed the listener. Though she was so near, her features were
      not very clearly visible; but her attitude&mdash;her hand raised aloft&mdash;the
      outline of her wasted but still commanding form, were more impressive from
      the shadowy dimness of the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come round, Catherine,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton after a pause; &ldquo;I will admit
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shut the window, stole to the door, unbarred it gently, and admitted
      his visitor. He bade her follow him; and, shading the light with his hand,
      crept up the stairs. Catherine&rsquo;s step made no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed, unmolested, and unheard, the room in which the wife was
      drowsily reading, according to her custom before she tied her nightcap and
      got into bed, a chapter in some pious book. They ascended to the chamber
      where Sidney lay; Morton opened the door cautiously, and stood at the
      threshold, so holding the candle that its light might not wake the child,
      though it sufficed to guide Catherine to the bed. The room was small,
      perhaps close, but scrupulously clean; for cleanliness was Mrs. Roger
      Morton&rsquo;s capital virtue. The mother, with a tremulous hand, drew aside the
      white curtains, and checked her sobs as she gazed on the young quiet face
      that was turned towards her. She gazed some moments in passionate silence;
      who shall say, beneath that silence, what thoughts, what prayers moved and
      stirred!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then bending down, with pale, convulsive lips she kissed the little hands
      thrown so listlessly on the coverlet of the pillow on which the head lay.
      After this she turned her face to her brother with a mute appeal in her
      glance, took a ring from her finger&mdash;a ring that had never till then
      left it&mdash;the ring which Philip Beaufort had placed there the day
      after that child was born. &ldquo;Let him wear this round his neck,&rdquo; said she,
      and stopped, lest she should sob aloud, and disturb the boy. In that gift
      she felt as if she invoked the father&rsquo;s spirit to watch over the
      friendless orphan; and then, pressing together her own hands firmly, as we
      do in some paroxysm of great pain, she turned from the room, descended the
      stairs, gained the street, and muttered to her brother, &ldquo;I am happy now;
      peace be on these thresholds!&rdquo; Before he could answer she was gone.

    <p>
      It was that period of the year when, to those who look on the surface of
      society, London wears its most radiant smile; when shops are gayest, and
      trade most brisk; when down the thoroughfares roll and glitter the
      countless streams of indolent and voluptuous life; when the upper class
      spend, and the middle class make; when the ball-room is the Market of
      Beauty, and the club-house the School for Scandal; when the hells yawn for
      their prey, and opera-singers and fiddlers&mdash;creatures hatched from
      gold, as the dung-flies from the dung&mdash;swarm, and buzz, and fatten,
      round the hide of the gentle Public. In the cant phase, it was &ldquo;the London
      season.&rdquo; And happy, take it altogether, happy above the rest of the year,
      even for the hapless, is that period of ferment and fever. It is not the
      season for duns, and the debtor glides about with a less anxious eye; and
      the weather is warm, and the vagrant sleeps, unfrozen, under the starlit
      portico; and the beggar thrives, and the thief rejoices&mdash;for the
      rankness of the civilisation has superfluities clutched by all. And out of
      the general corruption things sordid and things miserable crawl forth to
      bask in the common sunshine&mdash;things that perish when the first autumn
      winds whistle along the melancholy city. It is the gay time for the heir
      and the beauty, and the statesman and the lawyer, and the mother with her
      young daughters, and the artist with his fresh pictures, and the poet with
      his new book. It is the gay time, too, for the starved journeyman, and the
      ragged outcast that with long stride and patient eyes follows, for pence,
      the equestrian, who bids him go and be d&mdash;-d in vain. It is a gay
      time for the painted harlot in a crimson pelisse; and a gay time for the
      old hag that loiters about the thresholds of the gin-shop, to buy back, in
      a draught, the dreams of departed youth. It is gay, in fine, as the
      fulness of a vast city is ever gay&mdash;for Vice as for Innocence, for
      Poverty as for Wealth. And the wheels of every single destiny wheel on the
      merrier, no matter whether they are bound to Heaven or to Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Beaufort, the young heir, was at his father&rsquo;s house. He was fresh
      from Oxford, where he had already discovered that learning is not better
      than house and land. Since the new prospects opened to him, Arthur
      Beaufort was greatly changed. Naturally studious and prudent, had his
      fortunes remained what they had been before his uncle&rsquo;s death, he would
      probably have become a laborious and distinguished man. But though his
      abilities were good, he had not those restless impulses which belong to
      Genius&mdash;often not only its glory, but its curse. The Golden Rod cast
      his energies asleep at once. Good-natured to a fault, and somewhat
      vacillating in character, he adopted the manner and the code of the rich
      young idlers who were his equals at College. He became, like them,
      careless, extravagant, and fond of pleasure. This change, if it
      deteriorated his mind, improved his exterior. It was a change that could
      not but please women; and of all women his mother the most. Mrs. Beaufort
      was a lady of high birth; and in marrying her, Robert had hoped much from
      the interest of her connections; but a change in the ministry had thrown
      her relations out of power; and, beyond her dowry, he obtained no worldly
      advantage with the lady of his mercenary choice. Mrs. Beaufort was a woman
      whom a word or two will describe. She was thoroughly commonplace&mdash;neither
      bad nor good, neither clever nor silly. She was what is called well-bred;
      that is, languid, silent, perfectly dressed, and insipid. Of her two
      children, Arthur was almost the exclusive favourite, especially after he
      became the heir to such brilliant fortunes. For she was so much the
      mechanical creature of the world, that even her affection was warm or cold
      in proportion as the world shone on it. Without being absolutely in love
      with her husband, she liked him&mdash;they suited each other; and (in
      spite of all the temptations that had beset her in their earlier years,
      for she had been esteemed a beauty&mdash;and lived, as worldly people must
      do, in circles where examples of unpunished gallantry are numerous and
      contagious) her conduct had ever been scrupulously correct. She had little
      or no feeling for misfortunes with which she had never come into contact;
      for those with which she had&mdash;such as the distresses of younger sons,
      or the errors of fashionable women, or the disappointments of &ldquo;a proper
      ambition&rdquo;&mdash;she had more sympathy than might have been supposed, and
      touched on them with all the tact of well-bred charity and ladylike
      forbearance. Thus, though she was regarded as a strict person in point of
      moral decorum, yet in society she was popular&mdash;as women at once
      pretty and inoffensive generally are.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do Mrs. Beaufort justice, she had not been privy to the letter her
      husband wrote to Catherine, although not wholly innocent of it. The fact
      is, that Robert had never mentioned to her the peculiar circumstances that
      made Catherine an exception from ordinary rules&mdash;the generous
      propositions of his brother to him the night before his death; and,
      whatever his incredulity as to the alleged private marriage, the perfect
      loyalty and faith that Catherine had borne to the deceased,&mdash;he had
      merely observed, &ldquo;I must do something, I suppose, for that woman; she very
      nearly entrapped my poor brother into marrying her; and he would then, for
      what I know, have cut Arthur out of the estates. Still, I must do
      something for her&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so. What was she?&mdash;very low?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tradesman&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The children should be provided for according to the rank of the mother;
      that&rsquo;s the general rule in such cases: and the mother should have about
      the same provision she might have looked for if she had married a
      tradesman and been left a widow. I dare say she was a very artful kind of
      person, and don&rsquo;t deserve anything; but it is always handsomer, in the
      eyes of the world, to go by the general rules people lay down as to money
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So spoke Mrs. Beaufort. She concluded her husband had settled the matter,
      and never again recurred to it. Indeed, she had never liked the late Mr.
      Beaufort, whom she considered mauvais ton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the breakfast-room at Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s, the mother and son were seated;
      the former at work, the latter lounging by the window: they were not
      alone. In a large elbow-chair sat a middle-aged man, listening, or
      appearing to listen, to the prattle of a beautiful little girl&mdash;Arthur
      Beaufort&rsquo;s sister. This man was not handsome, but there was a certain
      elegance in his air, and a certain intelligence in his countenance, which
      made his appearance pleasing. He had that kind of eye which is often seen
      with red hair&mdash;an eye of a reddish hazel, with very long lashes; the
      eyebrows were dark, and clearly defined; and the short hair showed to
      advantage the contour of a small well-shaped head. His features were
      irregular; the complexion had been sanguine, but was now faded, and a
      yellow tinge mingled with the red. His face was more wrinkled, especially
      round the eyes&mdash;which, when he laughed, were scarcely visible&mdash;than
      is usual even in men ten years older. But his teeth were still of a
      dazzling whiteness; nor was there any trace of decayed health in his
      countenance. He seemed one who had lived hard; but who had much yet left
      in the lamp wherewith to feed the wick. At the first glance he appeared
      slight, as he lolled listlessly in his chair&mdash;almost fragile. But, at
      a nearer examination, you perceived that, in spite of the small
      extremities and delicate bones, his frame was constitutionally strong.
      Without being broad in the shoulders, he was exceedingly deep in the chest&mdash;deeper
      than men who seemed giants by his side; and his gestures had the ease of
      one accustomed to an active life. He had, indeed, been celebrated in his
      youth for his skill in athletic exercises, but a wound, received in a duel
      many years ago, had rendered him lame for life&mdash;a misfortune which
      interfered with his former habits, and was said to have soured his temper.
      This personage, whose position and character will be described hereafter,
      was Lord Lilburne, the brother of Mrs. Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Camilla,&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne to his niece, as carelessly, not fondly,
      he stroked down her glossy ringlets, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t like Berkeley Square as
      you did Gloucester Place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! not half so much! You see I never walk out in the fields,&mdash;[Now
      the Regent&rsquo;s Park.]&mdash;nor make daisy-chains at Primrose Hill. I don&rsquo;t
      know what mamma means,&rdquo; added the child, in a whisper, &ldquo;in saying we are
      better off here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lilburne smiled, but the smile was a half sneer. &ldquo;You will know quite
      soon enough, Camilla; the understandings of young ladies grow up very
      quickly on this side of Oxford Street. Well, Arthur, and what are your
      plans to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Arthur, suppressing a yawn, &ldquo;I have promised to ride out with
      a friend of mine, to see a horse that is for sale somewhere in the
      suburbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Arthur rose, stretched himself, looked in the glass, and then
      glanced impatiently at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to be here by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He! who?&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne, &ldquo;the horse or the other animal&mdash;I mean
      the friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The friend,&rdquo; answered Arthur, smiling, but colouring while he smiled, for
      he half suspected the quiet sneer of his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your friend, Arthur?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Beaufort, looking up from her
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watson, an Oxford man. By the by, I must introduce him to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watson! what Watson? what family of Watson? Some Watsons are good and
      some are bad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Beaufort, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they are very unlike the rest of mankind,&rdquo; observed Lord Lilburne,
      drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my Watson is a very gentlemanlike person, I assure you,&rdquo; said Arthur,
      half-laughing, &ldquo;and you need not be ashamed of him.&rdquo; Then, rather desirous
      of turning the conversation, he continued, &ldquo;So my father will be back from
      Beaufort Court to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he writes in excellent spirits. He says the rents will bear raising
      at least ten per cent., and that the house will not require much repair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Arthur threw open the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Watson! how are you? How d&rsquo;ye do, Marsden? Danvers, too! that&rsquo;s
      capital! the more the merrier! I will be down in an instant. But would you
      not rather come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An agreeable inundation,&rdquo; murmured Lord Lilburne. &ldquo;Three at a time: he
      takes your house for Trinity College.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud, clear voice, however, declined the invitation; the horses were
      heard pawing without. Arthur seized his hat and whip, and glanced to his
      mother and uncle, smilingly. &ldquo;Good-bye! I shall be out till dinner. Kiss
      me, my pretty Milly!&rdquo; And as his sister, who had run to the window,
      sickening for the fresh air and exercise he was about to enjoy, now turned
      to him wistful and mournful eyes, the kind-hearted young man took her in
      his arms, and whispered while he kissed her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up early to-morrow, and we&rsquo;ll have such a nice walk together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was gone: his mother&rsquo;s gaze had followed his young and graceful
      figure to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Own that he is handsome, Lilburne. May I not say more:&mdash;has he not
      the proper air?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister, your son will be rich. As for his air, he has plenty of
      airs, but wants graces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who could polish him like yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably no one. But had I a son&mdash;which Heaven forbid!&mdash;he
      should not have me for his Mentor. Place a young man&mdash;(go and shut
      the door, Camilla!)&mdash;between two vices&mdash;women and gambling, if
      you want to polish him into the fashionable smoothness. Entre nous, the
      varnish is a little expensive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaufort sighed. Lord Lilburne smiled. He had a strange pleasure in
      hurting the feelings of others. Besides, he disliked youth: in his own
      youth he had enjoyed so much that he grew sour when he saw the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Arthur Beaufort and his friends, careless of the warmth of the
      day, were laughing merrily, and talking gaily, as they made for the suburb
      of H&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an out-of-the-way place for a horse, too,&rdquo; said Sir Harry Danvers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I assure you,&rdquo; insisted Mr. Watson, earnestly, &ldquo;that my groom, who is
      a capital judge, says it is the cleverest hack he ever mounted. It has won
      several trotting matches. It belonged to a sporting tradesman, now done
      up. The advertisement caught me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, gaily, &ldquo;at all events the ride is delightful. What
      weather! You must all dine with me at Richmond to-morrow&mdash;we will row
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a little chicken-hazard, at the M&mdash;-, afterwards,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Marsden, who was an elder, not a better, man than the rest&mdash;a
      handsome, saturnine man&mdash;who had just left Oxford, and was already
      known on the turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything you please,&rdquo; said Arthur, making his horse curvet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Mr. Robert Beaufort! Mr. Robert Beaufort! could your prudent,
      scheming, worldly heart but feel what devil&rsquo;s tricks your wealth was
      playing with a son who if poor had been the pride of the Beauforts! On one
      side of our pieces of old we see the saint trampling down the dragon.
      False emblem! Reverse it on the coin! In the real use of the gold, it is
      the dragon who tramples down the saint! But on&mdash;on! the day is bright
      and your companions merry; make the best of your green years, Arthur
      Beaufort!
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men had just entered the suburb of H&mdash;-, and were spurring
      on four abreast at a canter. At that time an old man, feeling his way
      before him with a stick,&mdash;for though not quite blind, he saw
      imperfectly,&mdash;was crossing the road. Arthur and his friends, in loud
      converse, did not observe the poor passenger. He stopped abruptly, for his
      ear caught the sound of danger&mdash;it was too late: Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s horse,
      hard-mouthed, and high-stepping, came full against him. Mr. Marsden looked
      down:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang these old men! always in the way,&rdquo; said he, plaintively, and in the
      tone of a much-injured person, and, with that, Mr. Marsden rode on. But
      the others, who were younger&mdash;who were not gamblers&mdash;who were
      not yet grinded down into stone by the world&rsquo;s wheels&mdash;the others
      halted. Arthur Beaufort leaped from his horse, and the old man was already
      in his arms; but he was severely hurt. The blood trickled from his
      forehead; he complained of pains in his side and limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lean on me, my poor fellow! Do you live far off? I will take you home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many yards. This would not have happened if I had had my dog. Never
      mind, sir, go your way. It is only an old man&mdash;what of that? I wish I
      had my dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will join you,&rdquo; said Arthur to his friends; &ldquo;my groom has the
      direction. I will just take the poor old man home, and send for a surgeon.
      I shall not be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So like you, Beaufort: the best fellow in the world!&rdquo; said Mr. Watson,
      with some emotion. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Marsden positively, dismounted, and
      looking at his horse&rsquo;s knees as if they could be hurt! Here&rsquo;s a sovereign
      for you, my man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s another,&rdquo; said Sir Harry; &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s settled. Well, you will
      join us, Beaufort? You see the yard yonder. We&rsquo;ll wait twenty minutes for
      you. Come on, Watson.&rdquo; The old man had not picked up the sovereigns thrown
      at his feet, neither had he thanked the donors. And on his countenance
      there was a sour, querulous, resentful expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must a man be a beggar because he is run over, or because he is half
      blind?&rdquo; said he, turning his dim, wandering eyes painfully towards Arthur.
      &ldquo;Well, I wish I had my dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will supply his place,&rdquo; said Arthur, soothingly. &ldquo;Come, lean on me&mdash;heavier;
      that&rsquo;s right. You are not so bad,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&mdash;the sovereigns!&mdash;it is wicked to leave them in the
      kennel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur smiled. &ldquo;Here they are, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man slid the coins into his pocket, and Arthur continued to talk,
      though he got but short answers, and those only in the way of direction,
      till at last the old man stopped at the door of a small house near the
      churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      After twice ringing the bell, the door was opened by a middle-aged woman,
      whose appearance was above that of a common menial; dressed, somewhat
      gaily for her years, in a cap seated very far back on a black touroet, and
      decorated with red ribands, an apron made out of an Indian silk
      handkerchief, a puce-coloured sarcenet gown, black silk stockings, long
      gilt earrings, and a watch at her girdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless us and save us, sir! What has happened?&rdquo; exclaimed this worthy
      personage, holding up her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish! I am faint: let me in. I don&rsquo;t want your aid any more, sir. Thank
      you. Good day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not discouraged by this farewell, the churlish tone of which fell harmless
      on the invincibly sweet temper of Arthur, the young man continued to
      assist the sufferer along the narrow passage into a little old-fashioned
      parlour; and no sooner was the owner deposited on his worm-eaten leather
      chair than he fainted away. On reaching the house, Arthur had sent his
      servant (who had followed him with the horses) for the nearest surgeon;
      and while the woman was still employed, after taking off the sufferer&rsquo;s
      cravat, in burning feathers under his nose, there was heard a sharp rap
      and a shrill ring. Arthur opened the door, and admitted a smart little man
      in nankeen breeches and gaiters. He bustled into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this&mdash;bad accident&mdash;um&mdash;um! Sad thing, very sad.
      Open the window. A glass of water&mdash;a towel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;so: I see&mdash;I see&mdash;no fracture&mdash;contusion. Help
      him off with his coat. Another chair, ma&rsquo;am; put up his poor legs. What
      age is he, ma&rsquo;am?&mdash;Sixty-eight! Too old to bleed. Thank you. How is
      it, sir? Poorly, to be sure: will be comfortable presently&mdash;faintish
      still? Soon put all to rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tray! Tray! Where&rsquo;s my dog, Mrs. Boxer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, sir, what do you want with your dog now? He is in the back-yard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what business has my dog in the back-yard?&rdquo; almost screamed the
      sufferer, in accents that denoted no diminution of vigour. &ldquo;I thought as
      soon as my back was turned my dog would be ill-used! Why did I go without
      my dog? Let in my dog directly, Mrs. Boxer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, you see, sir,&rdquo; said the apothecary, turning to Beaufort&mdash;&ldquo;no
      cause for alarm&mdash;very comforting that little passion&mdash;does him
      good&mdash;sets one&rsquo;s mind easy. How did it happen? Ah, I understand!
      knocked down&mdash;might have been worse. Your groom (sharp fellow!)
      explained in a trice, sir. Thought it was my old friend here by the
      description. Worthy man&mdash;settled here a many year&mdash;very odd&mdash;eccentric
      (this in a whisper). Came off instantly: just at dinner&mdash;cold lamb
      and salad. &lsquo;Mrs. Perkins,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;if any one calls for me, I shall be at
      No. 4, Prospect Place.&rsquo; Your servant observed the address, sir. Oh, very
      sharp fellow! See how the old gentleman takes to his dog&mdash;fine little
      dog&mdash;what a stump of a tail! Deal of practice&mdash;expect two
      accouchements every hour. Hot weather for childbirth. So says I to Mrs.
      Perkins, &lsquo;If Mrs. Plummer is taken, or Mrs. Everat, or if old Mr. Grub has
      another fit, send off at once to No. 4. Medical men should be always in
      the way&mdash;that&rsquo;s my maxim. Now, sir, where do you feel the pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my ears, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, that looks bad. How long have you felt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since you have been in the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I take. Ha! ha!&mdash;very eccentric&mdash;very!&rdquo; muttered the
      apothecary, a little disconcerted. &ldquo;Well, let him lie down, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;ll
      send him a little quieting draught to be taken directly&mdash;pill at
      night, aperient in the morning. If wanted, send for me&mdash;always to be
      found. Bless me, that&rsquo;s my boy Bob&rsquo;s ring. Please to open the door, ma&rsquo; 
      am. Know his ring&mdash;very peculiar knack of his own. Lay ten to one it
      is Mrs. Plummer, or perhaps, Mrs. Everat&mdash;her ninth child in eight
      years&mdash;in the grocery line. A woman in a thousand, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a thin boy, with very short coat-sleeves, and very large hands, burst
      into the room with his mouth open. &ldquo;Sir&mdash;Mr. Perkins&mdash;sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I know&mdash;coming. Mrs. Plummer or Mrs. Everat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; it be the poor lady at Mrs. Lacy&rsquo;s; she be taken desperate. Mrs.
      Lacy&rsquo;s girl has just been over to the shop, and made me run here to you,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Lacy&rsquo;s! oh, I know. Poor Mrs. Morton! Bad case&mdash;very bad&mdash;must
      be off. Keep him quiet, ma&rsquo;am. Good day! Look in to-morrow&mdash;nine
      o&rsquo;clock. Put a little lint with the lotion on the head, ma&rsquo;am. Mrs.
      Morton! Ah! bad job that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the apothecary had shuffled himself off to the street door, when
      Arthur laid his hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Morton! Did you say Morton, sir? What kind of a person&mdash;is she
      very ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hopeless case, sir&mdash;general break-up. Nice woman&mdash;quite the
      lady&mdash;known better days, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she any children&mdash;sons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two&mdash;both away now&mdash;fine lads&mdash;quite wrapped up in them&mdash;youngest
      especially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! it must be she&mdash;ill, and dying, and destitute,
      perhaps,&rdquo;&mdash;exclaimed Arthur, with real and deep feeling; &ldquo;I will go
      with you, sir. I fancy that I know this lady&mdash;that,&rdquo; he added
      generously, &ldquo;I am related to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&mdash;glad to hear it. Come along, then; she ought to have some
      one near her besides servants: not but what Jenny, the maid, is uncommonly
      kind. Dr. &mdash;&mdash;-, who attends her sometimes, said to me, says he,
      &lsquo;It is the mind, Mr. Perkins; I wish we could get back her boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Prenticed out, I fancy. Master Sidney&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that was his name&mdash;pretty name. D&rsquo;ye know Sir Sidney Smith?&mdash;extraordinary
      man, sir! Master Sidney was a beautiful child&mdash;quite spoiled. She
      always fancied him ailing&mdash;always sending for me. &lsquo;Mr. Perkins,&rsquo; said
      she, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s something the matter with my child; I&rsquo;m sure there is,
      though he won&rsquo;t own it. He has lost his appetite&mdash;had a headache last
      night.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nothing the matter, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;wish you&rsquo;d think more of
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These mothers are silly, anxious, poor creatures. Nater, sir, Nater&mdash;wonderful
      thing&mdash;Nater!&mdash;Here we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the apothecary knocked at the private door of a milliner and hosier&rsquo;s
      shop.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>

      &ldquo;Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourished.&rdquo;&mdash;Titus
      Andronicus.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As might be expected, the excitement and fatigue of Catherine&rsquo;s journey to
      N&mdash;&mdash; had considerably accelerated the progress of disease. And
      when she reached home, and looked round the cheerless rooms all solitary,
      all hushed&mdash;Sidney gone, gone from her for ever, she felt, indeed, as
      if the last reed on which she had leaned was broken, and her business upon
      earth was done. Catherine was not condemned to absolute poverty&mdash;the
      poverty which grinds and gnaws, the poverty of rags and famine. She had
      still left nearly half of such portion of the little capital, realised by
      the sale of her trinkets, as had escaped the clutch of the law; and her
      brother had forced into her hands a note for L20. with an assurance that
      the same sum should be paid to her half-yearly. Alas! there was little
      chance of her needing it again! She was not, then, in want of means to
      procure the common comforts of life. But now a new passion had entered
      into her breast&mdash;the passion of the miser; she wished to hoard every
      sixpence as some little provision for her children. What was the use of
      her feeding a lamp nearly extinguished, and which was fated to be soon
      broken up and cast amidst the vast lumber-house of Death? She would
      willingly have removed into a more homely lodging, but the servant of the
      house had been so fond of Sidney&mdash;so kind to him. She clung to one
      familiar face on which there seemed to live the reflection of her child&rsquo;s.
      But she relinquished the first floor for the second; and there, day by
      day, she felt her eyes grow heavier and heavier beneath the clouds of the
      last sleep. Besides the aid of Mr. Perkins, a kind enough man in his way,
      the good physician whom she had before consulted, still attended her, and
      refused his fee. Shocked at perceiving that she rejected every little
      alleviation of her condition, and wishing at least to procure for her last
      hours the society of one of her sons, he had inquired the address of the
      elder; and on the day preceding the one in which Arthur discovered her
      abode, he despatched to Philip the following letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR:&mdash;Being called in to attend your mother in a lingering illness,
      which I fear may prove fatal, I think it my duty to request you to come to
      her as soon as you receive this. Your presence cannot but be a great
      comfort to her. The nature of her illness is such that it is impossible to
      calculate exactly how long she may be spared to you; but I am sure her
      fate might be prolonged, and her remaining days more happy, if she could
      be induced to remove into a better air and a more quiet neighbourhood, to
      take more generous sustenance, and, above all, if her mind could be set
      more at ease as to your and your brother&rsquo;s prospects. You must pardon me
      if I have seemed inquisitive; but I have sought to draw from your mother
      some particulars as to her family and connections, with a wish to
      represent to them her state of mind. She is, however, very reserved on
      these points. If, however, you have relations well to do in the world, I
      think some application to them should be made. I fear the state of her
      affairs weighs much upon your poor mother&rsquo;s mind; and I must leave you to
      judge how far it can be relieved by the good feeling of any persons upon
      whom she may have legitimate claims. At all events, I repeat my wish that
      you should come to her forthwith.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  &ldquo;I am, &amp;c.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      After the physician had despatched this letter, a sudden and marked
      alteration for the worse took place in his patient&rsquo;s disorder; and in the
      visit he had paid that morning, he saw cause to fear that her hours on
      earth would be much fewer than he had before anticipated. He had left her,
      however, comparatively better; but two hours after his departure, the
      symptoms of her disease had become very alarming, and the good-natured
      servant girl, her sole nurse, and who had, moreover, the whole business of
      the other lodgers to attend to, had, as we have seen, thought it necessary
      to summon the apothecary in the interval that must elapse before she could
      reach the distant part of the metropolis in which Dr. &mdash;&mdash;
      resided.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the chamber, Arthur felt all the remorse, which of right
      belonged to his father, press heavily on his soul. What a contrast, that
      mean and solitary chamber, and its comfortless appurtenances, to the
      graceful and luxurious abode where, full of health and hope, he had last
      beheld her, the mother of Philip Beaufort&rsquo;s children! He remained silent
      till Mr. Perkins, after a few questions, retired to send his drugs. He
      then approached the bed; Catherine, though very weak and suffering much
      pain, was still sensible. She turned her dim eyes on the young man; but
      she did not recognise his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not remember me?&rdquo; said he, in a voice struggling with tears: &ldquo;I am
      Arthur&mdash;Arthur Beaufort.&rdquo; Catherine made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! Why do I see you here? I believed you with your friends&mdash;your
      children provided for&mdash;as became my father to do. He assured me that
      you were so.&rdquo; Still no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the young man, overpowered with the feelings of a sympathising
      and generous nature, forgetting for a while Catherine&rsquo;s weakness, poured
      forth a torrent of inquiries, regrets, and self-upbraidings, which
      Catherine at first little heeded. But the name of her children, repeated
      again and again, struck upon that chord which, in a woman&rsquo;s heart, is the
      last to break; and she raised herself in her bed, and looked at her
      visitor wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; she said, then&mdash;&ldquo;your father was unlike my Philip; but
      I see things differently now. For me, all bounty is too late; but my
      children&mdash;to-morrow they may have no mother. The law is with you, but
      not justice! You will be rich and powerful;&mdash;will you befriend my
      children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through life, so help me Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Arthur, falling on his knees
      beside the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then passed between them it is needless to detail; for it was little,
      save broken repetitions of the same prayer and the same response. But
      there was so much truth and earnestness in Arthur&rsquo;s voice and countenance,
      that Catherine felt as if an angel had come there to administer comfort.
      And when late in the day the physician entered, he found his patient
      leaning on the breast of her young visitor, and looking on his face with a
      happy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician gathered enough from the appearance of Arthur and the gossip
      of Mr. Perkins, to conjecture that one of the rich relations he had
      attributed to Catherine was arrived. Alas! for her it was now indeed too
      late!

      Phillip had been five weeks in his new home: in another week, he was to
      enter on his articles of apprenticeship. With a stern, unbending gloom of
      manner, he had commenced the duties of his novitiate. He submitted to all
      that was enjoined him. He seemed to have lost for ever the wild and unruly
      waywardness that had stamped his boyhood; but he was never seen to smile&mdash;he
      scarcely ever opened his lips. His very soul seemed to have quitted him
      with its faults; and he performed all the functions of his situation with
      the quiet listless regularity of a machine. Only when the work was done
      and the shop closed, instead of joining the family circle in the back
      parlour, he would stroll out in the dusk of the evening, away from the
      town, and not return till the hour at which the family retired to rest.
      Punctual in all he did, he never exceeded that hour. He had heard once a
      week from his mother; and only on the mornings in which he expected a
      letter, did he seem restless and agitated. Till the postman entered the
      shop, he was as pale as death&mdash;his hands trembling&mdash;his lips
      compressed. When he read the letter he became composed for Catherine
      sedulously concealed from her son the state of her health: she wrote
      cheerfully, besought him to content himself with the state into which he
      had fallen, and expressed her joy that in his letters he intimated that
      content; for the poor boy&rsquo;s letters were not less considerate than her
      own. On her return from her brother, she had so far silenced or concealed
      her misgivings as to express satisfaction at the home she had provided for
      Sidney; and she even held out hopes of some future when, their probation
      finished and their independence secured, she might reside with her sons
      alternately. These hopes redoubled Philip&rsquo;s assiduity, and he saved every
      shilling of his weekly stipend; and sighed as he thought that in another
      week his term of apprenticeship would commence, and the stipend cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Plaskwith could not but be pleased on the whole with the diligence of
      his assistant, but he was chafed and irritated by the sullenness of his
      manner. As for Mrs. Plaskwith, poor woman! she positively detested the
      taciturn and moody boy, who never mingled in the jokes of the circle, nor
      played with the children, nor complimented her, nor added, in short,
      anything to the sociability of the house. Mr. Plimmins, who had at first
      sought to condescend, next sought to bully; but the gaunt frame and savage
      eye of Philip awed the smirk youth, in spite of himself; and he confessed
      to Mrs. Plaskwith that he should not like to meet &ldquo;the gipsy,&rdquo; alone, on a
      dark night; to which Mrs. Plaskwith replied, as usual, &ldquo;that Mr. Plimmins
      always did say the best things in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One morning, Philip was sent a few miles into the country, to assist in
      cataloguing some books in the library of Sir Thomas Champerdown&mdash;that
      gentleman, who was a scholar, having requested that some one acquainted
      with the Greek character might be sent to him, and Philip being the only
      one in the shop who possessed such knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening before he returned. Mr. and Mrs. Plaskwith were both in the
      shop as he entered&mdash;in fact, they had been employed in talking him
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t abide him!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Plaskwith. &ldquo;If you choose to take him for
      good, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have an easy moment. I&rsquo;m sure the &lsquo;prentice that cut his
      master&rsquo;s throat at Chatham, last week, was just like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! Mrs. P.,&rdquo; said the bookseller, taking a huge pinch of snuff, as
      usual, from his waistcoat pocket. &ldquo;I myself was reserved when I was young;
      all reflective people are. I may observe, by the by, that it was the case
      with Napoleon Buonaparte: still, however, I must own he is a disagreeable
      youth, though he attends to his business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how fond of money he is!&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Plaskwith, &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t buy
      himself a new pair of shoes!&mdash;quite disgraceful! And did you see what
      a look he gave Plimmins, when he joked about his indifference to his sole?
      Plimmins always does say such good things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is shabby, certainly,&rdquo; said the bookseller; &ldquo;but the value of a book
      does not always depend on the binding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he is honest!&rdquo; observed Mrs. Plaskwith;&mdash;and here Philip
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said Mr. Plaskwith; &ldquo;you have had a long day&rsquo;s work: but I suppose
      it will take a week to finish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to go again to-morrow morning, sir: two days more will conclude the
      task.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a letter for you,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Plaskwith; &ldquo;you owes me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter!&rdquo; It was not his mother&rsquo;s hand&mdash;it was a strange writing&mdash;he
      gasped for breath as he broke the seal. It was the letter of the
      physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother, then, was ill&mdash;dying&mdash;wanting, perhaps, the
      necessaries of life. She would have concealed from him her illness and her
      poverty. His quick alarm exaggerated the last into utter want;&mdash;he
      uttered a cry that rang through the shop, and rushed to Mr. Plaskwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, sir! my mother is dying! She is poor, poor, perhaps starving;&mdash;money,
      money!&mdash;lend me money!&mdash;ten pounds!&mdash;five!&mdash;I will
      work for you all my life for nothing, but lend me the money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoity-toity!&rdquo; said Mrs. Plaskwith, nudging her husband&mdash;&ldquo;I told you
      what would come of it: it will be &lsquo;money or life&rsquo; next time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not heed or hear this address; but stood immediately before the
      bookseller, his hands clasped&mdash;wild impatience in his eyes. Mr.
      Plaskwith, somewhat stupefied, remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear me?&mdash;are you human?&rdquo; exclaimed Philip, his emotion
      revealing at once all the fire of his character. &ldquo;I tell you my mother is
      dying; I must go to her! Shall I go empty-handed? Give me money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Plaskwith was not a bad-hearted man; but he was a formal man, and an
      irritable one. The tone his shopboy (for so he considered Philip) assumed
      to him, before his own wife too (examples are very dangerous), rather
      exasperated than moved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way to speak to your master:&mdash;you forget yourself,
      young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget!&mdash;But, sir, if she has not necessaries&mdash;if she is
      starving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fudge!&rdquo; said Plaskwith. &ldquo;Mr. Morton writes me word that he has provided
      for your mother! Does he not, Hannah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More fool he, I&rsquo;m sure, with such a fine family of his own! Don&rsquo;t look at
      me in that way, young man; I won&rsquo;t take it&mdash;that I won&rsquo;t! I declare
      my blood friz to see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you advance me money?&mdash;five pounds&mdash;only five pounds, Mr.
      Plaskwith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not five shillings! Talk to me in this style!&mdash;not the man for it,
      sir!&mdash;highly improper. Come, shut up the shop, and recollect
      yourself; and, perhaps, when Sir Thomas&rsquo;s library is done, I may let you
      go to town. You can&rsquo;t go to-morrow. All a sham, perhaps; eh, Hannah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely! Consult Plimmins. Better come away now, Mr. P. He looks like
      a young tiger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Plaskwith quitted the shop for the parlour. Her husband, putting his
      hands behind his back, and throwing back his chin, was about to follow
      her. Philip, who had remained for the last moment mute and white as stone,
      turned abruptly; and his grief taking rather the tone of rage than
      supplication, he threw himself before his master, and, laying his hand on
      his shoulder, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I leave you&mdash;do not let it be with a curse. I conjure you, have
      mercy on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Plaskwith stopped; and had Philip then taken but a milder tone, all
      had been well. But, accustomed from childhood to command&mdash;all his
      fierce passions loose within him&mdash;despising the very man he thus
      implored&mdash;the boy ruined his own cause. Indignant at the silence of
      Mr. Plaskwith, and too blinded by his emotions to see that in that silence
      there was relenting, he suddenly shook the little man with a vehemence
      that almost overset him, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, who demand for five years my bones and blood&mdash;my body and soul&mdash;a
      slave to your vile trade&mdash;do you deny me bread for a mother&rsquo;s lips?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trembling with anger, and perhaps fear, Mr. Plaskwith extricated himself
      from the gripe of Philip, and, hurrying from the shop, said, as he banged
      the door:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg my pardon for this to-night, or out you go to-morrow, neck and crop!
      Zounds! a pretty pass the world&rsquo;s come to! I don&rsquo;t believe a word about
      your mother. Baugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Philip remained for some moments struggling with his wrath and
      agony. He then seized his hat, which he had thrown off on entering&mdash;pressed
      it over his brows&mdash;turned to quit the shop&mdash;when his eye fell
      upon the till. Plaskwith had left it open, and the gleam of the coin
      struck his gaze&mdash;that deadly smile of the arch tempter. Intellect,
      reason, conscience&mdash;all, in that instant, were confusion and chaos.
      He cast a hurried glance round the solitary and darkening room&mdash;plunged
      his hand into the drawer, clutched he knew not what&mdash;silver or gold,
      as it came uppermost&mdash;and burst into a loud and bitter laugh. The
      laugh itself startled him&mdash;it did not sound like his own. His face
      fell, and his knees knocked together&mdash;his hair bristled&mdash;he felt
      as if the very fiend had uttered that yell of joy over a fallen soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;no, my mother,&mdash;not even for
      thee!&rdquo; And, dashing the money to the ground, he fled, like a maniac, from
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a later hour that same evening, Mr. Robert Beaufort returned from his
      country mansion to Berkeley Square. He found his wife very uneasy and
      nervous about the non-appearance of their only son. Arthur had sent home
      his groom and horses about seven o&rsquo;clock, with a hurried scroll, written
      in pencil on a blank page torn from his pocket-book, and containing only
      these words,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait dinner for me&mdash;I may not be home for some hours. I have
      met with a melancholy adventure. You will approve what I have done when we
      meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This note a little perplexed Mr. Beaufort; but, as he was very hungry, he
      turned a deaf ear both to his wife&rsquo;s conjectures and his own surmises,
      till he had refreshed himself; and then he sent for the groom, and learned
      that, after the accident to the blind man, Mr. Arthur had been left at a
      hosier&rsquo;s in H&mdash;&mdash;. This seemed to him extremely mysterious; and,
      as hour after hour passed away, and still Arthur came not, he began to
      imbibe his wife&rsquo;s fears, which were now wound up almost to hysterics; and
      just at midnight he ordered his carriage, and taking with him the groom as
      a guide, set off to the suburban region. Mrs. Beaufort had wished to
      accompany him; but the husband observing that young men would be young
      men, and that there might possibly be a lady in the case, Mrs. Beaufort,
      after a pause of thought, passively agreed that, all things considered,
      she had better remain at home. No lady of proper decorum likes to run the
      risk of finding herself in a false position. Mr. Beaufort accordingly set
      out alone. Easy was the carriage&mdash;swift were the steeds&mdash;and
      luxuriously the wealthy man was whirled along. Not a suspicion of the true
      cause of Arthur&rsquo;s detention crossed him; but he thought of the snares of
      London&mdash;or artful females in distress; &ldquo;a melancholy adventure&rdquo;
       generally implies love for the adventure, and money for the melancholy;
      and Arthur was young&mdash;generous&mdash;with a heart and a pocket
      equally open to imposition. Such scrapes, however, do not terrify a father
      when he is a man of the world, so much as they do an anxious mother; and,
      with more curiosity than alarm, Mr. Beaufort, after a short doze, found
      himself before the shop indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, the door to the private entrance
      was ajar,&mdash;a circumstance which seemed very suspicious to Mr.
      Beaufort. He pushed it open with caution and timidity&mdash;a candle
      placed upon a chair in the narrow passage threw a sickly light over the
      flight of stairs, till swallowed up by the deep shadow from the sharp
      angle made by the ascent. Robert Beaufort stood a moment in some doubt
      whether to call, to knock, to recede, or to advance, when a step was heard
      upon the stairs above&mdash;it came nearer and nearer&mdash;a figure
      emerged from the shadow of the last landing-place, and Mr. Beaufort, to
      his great joy, recognised his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur did not, however, seem to perceive his father; and was about to
      pass him, when Mr. Beaufort laid his hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What means all this, Arthur? What place are you in? How you have alarmed
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur cast a look upon his father of sadness and reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said, in a tone that sounded stern&mdash;almost commanding&mdash;&ldquo;I
      will show you where I have been; follow me&mdash;nay, I say, follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, without another word re-ascended the stairs; and Mr. Beaufort,
      surprised and awed into mechanical obedience, did as his son desired. At
      the landing-place of the second floor, another long-wicked, neglected,
      ghastly candle emitted its cheerless ray. It gleamed through the open door
      of a small bedroom to the left, through which Beaufort perceived the forms
      of two women. One (it was the kindly maidservant) was seated on a chair,
      and weeping bitterly; the other (it was a hireling nurse, in the first and
      last day of her attendance) was unpinning her dingy shawl before she lay
      down to take a nap. She turned her vacant, listless face upon the two men,
      put on a doleful smile, and decently closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we, I say, Arthur?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Beaufort. Arthur took his
      father&rsquo;s hand-drew him into a room to the right&mdash;and taking up the
      candle, placed it on a small table beside a bell, and said, &ldquo;Here, sir&mdash;in
      the presence of Death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort cast a hurried and fearful glance on the still, wan, serene
      face beneath his eyes, and recognised in that glance the features of the
      neglected and the once adored Catherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;she, whom your brother so loved&mdash;the mother of his
      children&mdash;died in this squalid room, and far from her sons, in
      poverty, in sorrow! died of a broken heart! Was that well, father? Have
      you in this nothing to repent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conscience-stricken and appalled, the worldly man sank down on a seat
      beside the bed, and covered his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; continued Arthur, almost bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;ay, we, his nearest of kin&mdash;we,
      who have inherited his lands and gold&mdash;we have been thus heedless of
      the great legacy your brother bequeathed to us:&mdash;the things dearest
      to him&mdash;the woman he loved&mdash;the children his death cast,
      nameless and branded, on the world. Ay, weep, father: and while you weep,
      think of the future, of reparation. I have sworn to that clay to befriend
      her sons; join you, who have all the power to fulfil the promise&mdash;join
      in that vow: and may Heaven not visit on us both the woes of this bed of
      death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Mr. Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we should have known,&rdquo; interrupted Arthur, mournfully. &ldquo;Ah, my dear
      father! do not harden your heart by false excuses. The dead still speaks
      to you, and commends to your care her children. My task here is done: O
      sir! yours is to come. I leave you alone with the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the young man, whom the tragedy of the scene had worked into a
      passion and a dignity above his usual character, unwilling to trust
      himself farther to his emotions, turned abruptly from the room, fled
      rapidly down the stairs and left the house. As the carriage and liveries
      of his father met his eye, he groaned; for their evidences of comfort and
      wealth seemed a mockery to the deceased: he averted his face and walked
      on. Nor did he heed or even perceive a form that at that instant rushed by
      him&mdash;pale, haggard, breathless&mdash;towards the house which he had
      quitted, and the door of which he left open, as he had found it&mdash;open,
      as the physician had left it when hurrying, ten minutes before the arrival
      of Mr. Beaufort, from the spot where his skill was impotent. Wrapped in
      gloomy thought, alone, and on foot&mdash;at that dreary hour, and in that
      remote suburb&mdash;the heir of the Beauforts sought his splendid home.
      Anxious, fearful, hoping, the outcast orphan flew on to the death-room of
      his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort, who had but imperfectly heard Arthur&rsquo;s parting accents, lost
      and bewildered by the strangeness of his situation, did not at first
      perceive that he was left alone. Surprised, and chilled by the sudden
      silence of the chamber, he rose, withdrew his hands from his face, and
      again he saw that countenance so mute and solemn. He cast his gaze round
      the dismal room for Arthur; he called his name&mdash;no answer came; a
      superstitious tremor seized upon him; his limbs shook; he sank once more
      on his seat, and closed his eyes: muttering, for the first time, perhaps,
      since his childhood, words of penitence and prayer. He was roused from
      this bitter self-abstraction by a deep groan. It seemed to come from the
      bed. Did his ears deceive him? Had the dead found a voice? He started up
      in an agony of dread, and saw opposite to him the livid countenance of
      Philip Morton: the Son of the Corpse had replaced the Son of the Living
      Man! The dim and solitary light fell upon that countenance. There, all the
      bloom and freshness natural to youth seemed blasted! There, on those
      wasted features, played all the terrible power and glare of precocious
      passions,&mdash;rage, woe, scorn, despair. Terrible is it to see upon the
      face of a boy the storm and whirlwind that should visit only the strong
      heart of man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is dead!&mdash;dead! and in your presence!&rdquo; shouted Philip, with his
      wild eyes fixed upon the cowering uncle; &ldquo;dead with&mdash;care, perhaps
      with famine. And you have come to look upon your work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Beaufort, deprecatingly, &ldquo;I have but just arrived: I did
      not know she had been ill, or in want, upon my honour. This is all a&mdash;a&mdash;mistake:
      I&mdash;I&mdash;came in search of&mdash;of&mdash;another&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not, then, come to relieve her?&rdquo; said Philip, very calmly. &ldquo;You
      had not learned her suffering and distress, and flown hither in the hope
      that there was yet time to save her? You did not do this? Ha! ha!&mdash;why
      did I think it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any one call, gentlemen?&rdquo; said a whining voice at the door; and the
      nurse put in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;you may come in,&rdquo; said Beaufort, shaking with
      nameless and cowardly apprehension; but Philip had flown to the door, and,
      gazing on the nurse, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a stranger! see, a stranger! The son now has assumed his post.
      Begone, woman!&rdquo; And he pushed her away, and drew the bolt across the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there looked upon him, as there had looked upon his reluctant
      companion, calm and holy, the face of the peaceful corpse. He burst into
      tears, and fell on his knees so close to Beaufort that he touched him; he
      took up the heavy hand, and covered it with burning kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! mother! do not leave me! wake, smile once more on your son! I
      would have brought you money, but I could not have asked for your
      blessing, then; mother, I ask it now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had but known&mdash;if you had but written to me, my dear young
      gentleman&mdash;but my offers had been refused, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offers of a hireling&rsquo;s pittance to her; to her for whom my father would
      have coined his heart&rsquo;s blood into gold! My father&rsquo;s wife!&mdash;his wife!&mdash;offers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose suddenly, folded his arms, and facing Beaufort, with a fierce
      determined brow, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark me, you hold the wealth that I was trained from my cradle to
      consider my heritage. I have worked with these hands for bread, and never
      complained, except to my own heart and soul. I never hated, and never
      cursed you&mdash;robber as you were&mdash;yes, robber! For, even were
      there no marriage save in the sight of God, neither my father, nor Nature,
      nor Heaven, meant that you should seize all, and that there should be
      nothing due to the claims of affection and blood. He was not the less my
      father, even if the Church spoke not on my side. Despoiler of the orphan,
      and derider of human love, you are not the less a robber though the law
      fences you round, and men call you honest! But I did not hate you for
      this. Now, in the presence of my dead mother&mdash;dead, far from both her
      sons&mdash;now I abhor and curse you. You may think yourself safe when you
      quit this room&mdash;safe, and from my hatred you may be so but do not
      deceive yourself. The curse of the widow and the orphan shall pursue&mdash;it
      shall cling to you and yours&mdash;it shall gnaw your heart in the midst
      of splendour&mdash;it shall cleave to the heritage of your son! There
      shall be a deathbed yet, beside which you shall see the spectre of her,
      now so calm, rising for retribution from the grave! These words&mdash;no,
      you never shall forget them&mdash;years hence they shall ring in your
      ears, and freeze the marrow of your bones! And now begone, my father&rsquo;s
      brother&mdash;begone from my mother&rsquo;s corpse to your luxurious home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door, and pointed to the stairs. Beaufort, without a word,
      turned from the room and departed. He heard the door closed and locked as
      he descended the stairs; but he did not hear the deep groans and vehement
      sobs in which the desolate orphan gave vent to the anguish which succeeded
      to the less sacred paroxysm of revenge and wrath.

    <p>
      The time employed by Mr. Beaufort in reaching his home was haunted by
      gloomy and confused terrors. He felt inexplicably as if the denunciations
      of Philip were to visit less himself than his son. He trembled at the
      thought of Arthur meeting this strange, wild, exasperated scatterling&mdash;perhaps
      on the morrow&mdash;in the very height of his passions. And yet, after the
      scene between Arthur and himself, he saw cause to fear that he might not
      be able to exercise a sufficient authority over his son, however naturally
      facile and obedient, to prevent his return to the house of death. In this
      dilemma he resolved, as is usual with cleverer men, even when yoked to yet
      feebler helpmates, to hear if his wife had anything comforting or sensible
      to say upon the subject. Accordingly, on reaching Berkeley Square, he went
      straight to Mrs. Beaufort; and having relieved her mind as to Arthur&rsquo;s
      safety, related the scene in which he had been so unwilling an actor. With
      that more lively susceptibility which belongs to most women, however
      comparatively unfeeling, Mrs. Beaufort made greater allowance than her
      husband for the excitement Philip had betrayed. Still Beaufort&rsquo;s
      description of the dark menaces, the fierce countenance, the brigand-like
      form, of the bereaved son, gave her very considerable apprehensions for
      Arthur, should the young men meet; and she willingly coincided with her
      husband in the propriety of using all means of parental persuasion or
      command to guard against such an encounter. But, in the meanwhile, Arthur
      returned not, and new fears seized the anxious parents. He had gone forth
      alone, in a remote suburb of the metropolis, at a late hour, himself under
      strong excitement. He might have returned to the house, or have lost his
      way amidst some dark haunts of violence and crime; they knew not where to
      send, or what to suggest. Day already began to dawn, and still he came
      not. A length, towards five o&rsquo;clock, a loud rap was heard at the door, and
      Mr. Beaufort, hearing some bustle in the hall, descended. He saw his son
      borne into the hall from a hackney-coach by two strangers, pale, bleeding,
      and apparently insensible. His first thought was that he had been murdered
      by Philip. He uttered a feeble cry, and sank down beside his son.

      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be darnted, sir,&rdquo; said one of the strangers, who seemed an artisan;
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he be much hurt. You sees he was crossing the street, and
      the coach ran against him; but it did not go over his head; it be only the
      stones that makes him bleed so: and that&rsquo;s a mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A providence, sir,&rdquo; said the other man; &ldquo;but Providence watches over us
      all, night and day, sleep or wake. Hem! We were passing at the time from
      the meeting&mdash;the Odd Fellows, sir&mdash;and so we took him, and got
      him a coach; for we found his card in his pocket. He could not speak just
      then; but the rattling of the coach did him a deal of good, for he groaned&mdash;my
      eyes! how he groaned! did he not, Burrows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did one&rsquo;s heart good to hear him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run for Astley Cooper&mdash;you&mdash;go to Brodie. Good Heavens! he is
      dying. Be quick&mdash;quick!&rdquo; cried Mr. Beaufort to his servants, while
      Mrs. Beaufort, who had now gained the spot, with greater presence of mind
      had Arthur conveyed into a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a judgment upon me,&rdquo; groaned Beaufort, rooted to the stone of his
      hall, and left alone with the strangers. &ldquo;No, sir, it is not a judgment,
      it is a providence,&rdquo; said the more sanctimonious and better dressed of the
      two men &ldquo;for, put the question, if it had been a judgment, the wheel would
      have gone over him&mdash;but it didn&rsquo;t; and, whether he dies or not, I
      shall always say that if that&rsquo;s not a providence, I don&rsquo;t know what is. We
      have come a long way, sir; and Burrows is a poor man, though I&rsquo;m well to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This hint for money restored Beaufort to his recollection; he put his
      purse into the nearest hand outstretched to clutch it, and muttered forth
      something like thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, may the Lord bless you! and I hope the young gentleman will do well.
      I am sure you have cause to be thankful that he was within an inch of the
      wheel; was he not, Burrows? Well, it&rsquo;s enough to convert a heathen. But
      the ways of Providence are mysterious, and that&rsquo;s the truth of it. Good
      night, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly it did seem as if the curse of Philip was already at its work.
      An accident almost similar to that which, in the adventure of the blind
      man, had led Arthur to the clue of Catherine, within twenty-four hours
      stretched Arthur himself upon his bed. The sorrow Mr. Beaufort had not
      relieved was now at his own hearth. But there were parents and nurses, and
      great physicians, and skilful surgeons, and all the army that combine
      against Death, and there were ease, and luxury, and kind eyes, and pitying
      looks, and all that can take the sting from pain. And thus, the very night
      on which Catherine had died, broken down, and worn out, upon a strange
      breast, with a feeless doctor, and by the ray of a single candle, the heir
      to the fortunes once destined to her son wrestled also with the grim
      Tyrant, who seemed, however, scared from his prey by the arts and luxuries
      which the world of rich men raises up in defiance of the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur, was, indeed, very seriously injured; one of his ribs was broken,
      and he had received two severe contusions on the head. To insensibility
      succeeded fever, followed by delirium. He was in imminent danger for
      several days. If anything could console his parents for such an
      affliction, it was the thought that, at least, he was saved from the
      chance of meeting Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort, in the instinct of that capricious and fluctuating
      conscience which belongs to weak minds, which remains still, and drooping,
      and lifeless, as a flag on a masthead during the calm of prosperity, but
      flutters, and flaps, and tosses when the wind blows and the wave heaves,
      thought very acutely and remorsefully of the condition of the Mortons,
      during the danger of his own son. So far, indeed, from his anxiety for
      Arthur monopolising all his care, it only sharpened his charity towards
      the orphans; for many a man becomes devout and good when he fancies he has
      an Immediate interest in appeasing Providence. The morning after Arthur&rsquo;s
      accident, he sent for Mr. Blackwell. He commissioned him to see that
      Catherine&rsquo;s funeral rites were performed with all due care and attention;
      he bade him obtain an interview with Philip, and assure the youth of Mr.
      Beaufort&rsquo;s good and friendly disposition towards him, and to offer to
      forward his views in any course of education he might prefer, or any
      profession he might adopt; and he earnestly counselled the lawyer to
      employ all his tact and delicacy in conferring with one of so proud and
      fiery a temper. Mr. Blackwell, however, had no tact or delicacy to employ:
      he went to the house of mourning, forced his way to Philip, and the very
      exordium of his harangue, which was devoted to praises of the
      extraordinary generosity and benevolence of his employer, mingled with
      condescending admonitions towards gratitude from Philip, so exasperated
      the boy, that Mr. Blackwell was extremely glad to get out of the house
      with a whole skin. He, however, did not neglect the more formal part of
      his mission; but communicated immediately with a fashionable undertaker,
      and gave orders for a very genteel funeral. He thought after the funeral
      that Philip would be in a less excited state of mind, and more likely to
      hear reason; he, therefore, deferred a second interview with the orphan
      till after that event; and, in the meanwhile, despatched a letter to Mr.
      Beaufort, stating that he had attended to his instructions; that the
      orders for the funeral were given; but that at present Mr. Philip Morton&rsquo;s
      mind was a little disordered, and that he could not calmly discuss the
      plans for the future suggested by Mr. Beaufort. He did not doubt, however,
      that in another interview all would be arranged according to the wishes
      his client had so nobly conveyed to him. Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s conscience on this
      point was therefore set at rest. It was a dull, close, oppressive morning,
      upon which the remains of Catherine Morton were consigned to the grave.
      With the preparations for the funeral Philip did not interfere; he did not
      inquire by whose orders all that solemnity of mutes, and coaches, and
      black plumes, and crape bands, was appointed. If his vague and undeveloped
      conjecture ascribed this last and vain attention to Robert Beaufort, it
      neither lessened the sullen resentment he felt against his uncle, nor, on
      the other hand, did he conceive that he had a right to forbid respect to
      the dead, though he might reject service for the survivor. Since Mr.
      Blackwell&rsquo;s visit, he had remained in a sort of apathy or torpor, which
      seemed to the people of the house to partake rather of indifference than
      woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral was over, and Philip had returned to the apartments occupied
      by the deceased; and now, for the first time, he set himself to examine
      what papers, &amp;c., she had left behind. In an old escritoire, he found,
      first, various packets of letters in his father&rsquo;s handwriting, the
      characters in many of them faded by time. He opened a few; they were the
      earliest love-letters. He did not dare to read above a few lines; so much
      did their living tenderness, and breathing, frank, hearty passion,
      contrast with the fate of the adored one. In those letters, the very heart
      of the writer seemed to beat! Now both hearts alike were stilled! And
      GHOST called vainly unto GHOST!
    </p>
    <p>
      He came, at length, to a letter in his mother&rsquo;s hand, addressed to
      himself, and dated two days before her death. He went to the window and
      gasped in the mists of the sultry air for breath. Below were heard the
      noises of London; the shrill cries of itinerant vendors, the rolling
      carts, the whoop of boys returned for a while from school. Amidst all
      these rose one loud, merry peal of laughter, which drew his attention
      mechanically to the spot whence it came; it was at the threshold of a
      public-house, before which stood the hearse that had conveyed his mother&rsquo;s
      coffin, and the gay undertakers, halting there to refresh themselves. He
      closed the window with a groan, retired to the farthest corner of the
      room, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAREST PHILIP,&mdash;When you read this, I shall be no more. You and
      poor Sidney will have neither father nor mother, nor fortune, nor name.
      Heaven is more just than man, and in Heaven is my hope for you. You,
      Philip, are already past childhood; your nature is one formed, I think, to
      wrestle successfully with the world. Guard against your own passions, and
      you may bid defiance to the obstacles that will beset your path in life.
      And lately, in our reverses, Philip, you have so subdued those passions,
      so schooled the pride and impetuosity of your childhood, that I have
      contemplated your prospects with less fear than I used to do, even when
      they seemed so brilliant. Forgive me, my dear child, if I have concealed
      from you my state of health, and if my death be a sudden and unlooked-for
      shock. Do not grieve for me too long. For myself, my release is indeed
      escape from the prison-house and the chain&mdash;from bodily pain and
      mental torture, which may, I fondly hope, prove some expiation for the
      errors of a happier time. For I did err, when, even from the least selfish
      motives, I suffered my union with your father to remain concealed, and
      thus ruined the hopes of those who had rights upon me equal even to his.
      But, O Philip! beware of the first false steps into deceit; beware, too,
      of the passions, which do not betray their fruit till years and years
      after the leaves that look so green and the blossoms that seem so fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat my solemn injunction&mdash;Do not grieve for me; but strengthen
      your mind and heart to receive the charge that I now confide to you&mdash;my
      Sidney, my child, your brother! He is so soft, so gentle, he has been so
      dependent for very life upon me, and we are parted now for the first and
      last time. He is with strangers; and&mdash;and&mdash;O Philip, Philip!
      watch over him for the love you bear, not only to him, but to me! Be to
      him a father as well as a brother. Put your stout heart against the world,
      so that you may screen him, the weak child, from its malice. He has not
      your talents nor strength of character; without you he is nothing. Live,
      toil, rise for his sake not less than your own. If you knew how this heart
      beats as I write to you, if you could conceive what comfort I take for him
      from my confidence in you, you would feel a new spirit&mdash;my spirit&mdash;my
      mother-spirit of love, and forethought, and vigilance, enter into you
      while you read. See him when I am gone&mdash;comfort and soothe him.
      Happily he is too young yet to know all his loss; and do not let him think
      unkindly of me in the days to come, for he is a child now, and they may
      poison his mind against me more easily than they can yours. Think, if he
      is unhappy hereafter, he may forget how I loved him, he may curse those
      who gave him birth. Forgive me all this, Philip, my son, and heed it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, where you find this letter, you will see a key; it opens a well
      in the bureau in which I have hoarded my little savings. You will see that
      I have not died in poverty. Take what there is; young as you are, you may
      want it more now than hereafter. But hold it in trust for your brother as
      well as yourself. If he is harshly treated (and you will go and see him,
      and you will remember that he would writhe under what you might scarcely
      feel), or if they overtask him (he is so young to work), yet it may find
      him a home near you. God watch over and guard you both! You are orphans
      now. But HE has told even the orphans to call him &lsquo;Father!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had read this letter, Philip Morton fell upon his knees, and
      prayed.

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;His curse! Dost comprehend what that word means?
     Shot from a father&rsquo;s angry breath.&rdquo;
      JAMES SHIRLEY: The Brothers.

     &ldquo;This term is fatal, and affrights me.&rdquo;&mdash;Ibid.

     &ldquo;Those fond philosophers that magnify
     Our human nature......
     Conversed but little with the world-they knew not

</pre>
    <p>
      After he had recovered his self-possession, Philip opened the well of the
      bureau, and was astonished and affected to find that Catherine had saved
      more than L100. Alas! how much must she have pinched herself to have
      hoarded this little treasure! After burning his father&rsquo;s love-letters, and
      some other papers, which he deemed useless, he made up a little bundle of
      those trifling effects belonging to the deceased, which he valued as
      memorials and relies of her, quitted the apartment, and descended to the
      parlour behind the shop. On the way he met with the kind servant, and
      recalling the grief that she had manifested for his mother since he had
      been in the house, he placed two sovereigns in her hand. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said
      he, as the servant wept while he spoke, &ldquo;now I can bear to ask you what I
      have not before done. How did my poor mother die? Did she suffer much?&mdash;or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went off like a lamb, sir,&rdquo; said the girl, drying her eyes. &ldquo;You see
      the gentleman had been with her all the day, and she was much more easy
      and comfortable in her mind after he came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman! Not the gentleman I found here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no! Not the pale middle-aged gentleman nurse and I saw go down
      as the clock struck two. But the young, soft-spoken gentleman who came in
      the morning, and said as how he was a relation. He stayed with her till
      she slept; and, when she woke, she smiled in his face&mdash;I shall never
      forget that smile&mdash;for I was standing on the other side, as it might
      be here, and the doctor was by the window, pouring out the doctor&rsquo;s stuff
      in the glass; and so she looked on the young gentleman, and then looked
      round at us all, and shook her head very gently, but did not speak. And
      the gentleman asked her how she felt, and she took both his hands and
      kissed them; and then he put his arms round and raised her up to take the
      physic like, and she said then, &lsquo;You will never forget them?&rsquo; and he said,
      &lsquo;Never.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know what that meant, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well&mdash;go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her head fell back on his buzzom, and she looked so happy; and, when
      the doctor came to the bedside, she was quite gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the stranger had my post! No matter; God bless him&mdash;God bless
      him. Who was he? what was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir; he did not say. He stayed after the doctor went, and
      cried very bitterly; he took on more than you did, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other gentleman came just as he was a-going, and they did not
      seem to like each other; for I heard him through the wall, as nurse and I
      were in the next room, speak as if he was scolding; but he did not stay
      long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has never been seen since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Perhaps missus can tell you more about him. But won&rsquo;t you take
      something, sir? Do&mdash;you look so pale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip, without speaking, pushed her gently aside, and went slowly down
      the stairs. He entered the parlour, where two or three children were
      seated, playing at dominoes; he despatched one for their mother, the
      mistress of the shop, who came in, and dropped him a courtesy, with a very
      grave, sad face, as was proper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to leave your house, ma&rsquo;am; and I wish to settle any little
      arrears of rent, &amp;c.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O sir! don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said the landlady; and, as she spoke, she took
      a piece of paper from her bosom, very neatly folded, and laid it on the
      table. &ldquo;And here, sir,&rdquo; she added, taking from the same depository a card,&mdash;&ldquo;here
      is the card left by the gentleman who saw to the funeral. He called half
      an hour ago, and bade me say, with his compliments, that he would wait on
      you to-morrow at eleven o&rsquo;clock. So I hope you won&rsquo;t go yet: for I think
      he means to settle everything for you; he said as much, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip glanced over the card, and read, &ldquo;Mr. George Blackwell, Lincoln&rsquo;s
      Inn.&rdquo; His brow grew dark&mdash;he let the card fall on the ground, put his
      foot on it with a quiet scorn, and muttered to himself, &ldquo;The lawyer shall
      not bribe me out of my curse!&rdquo; He turned to the total of the bill&mdash;not
      heavy, for poor Catherine had regularly defrayed the expense of her scanty
      maintenance and humble lodging&mdash;paid the money, and, as the landlady
      wrote the receipt, he asked, &ldquo;Who was the gentleman&mdash;the younger
      gentleman&mdash;who called in the morning of the day my mother died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! I am so sorry I did not get his name. Mr. Perkins said that he
      was some relation. Very odd he has never been since. But he&rsquo;ll be sure to
      call again, sir; you had much better stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: it does not signify. All that he could do is done. But stay, give him
      this note, if he should call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip, taking the pen from the landlady&rsquo;s hand, hastily wrote (while Mrs.
      Lacy went to bring him sealing-wax and a light) these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot guess who you are: they say that you call yourself a relation;
      that must be some mistake. I knew not that my poor mother had relations so
      kind. But, whoever you be, you soothed her last hours&mdash;she died in
      your arms; and if ever&mdash;years, long years hence&mdash;we should
      chance to meet, and I can do anything to aid another, my blood, and my
      life, and my heart, and my soul, all are slaves to your will. If you be
      really of her kindred, I commend to you my brother: he is at &mdash;&mdash;,
      with Mr. Morton. If you can serve him, my mother&rsquo;s soul will watch over
      you as a guardian angel. As for me, I ask no help from any one: I go into
      the world and will carve out my own way. So much do I shrink from the
      thought of charity from others, that I do not believe I could bless you as
      I do now if your kindness to me did not close with the stone upon my
      mother&rsquo;s grave. PHILIP.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sealed this letter, and gave it to the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the by,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I had forgot; the Doctor said that if you
      would send for him, he would be most happy to call on you, and give you
      any advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what shall I say to Mr. Blackwell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he may tell his employer to remember our last interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that Philip took up his bundle and strode from the house. He went
      first to the churchyard, where his mother&rsquo;s remains had been that day
      interred. It was near at hand, a quiet, almost a rural, spot. The gate
      stood ajar, for there was a public path through the churchyard, and Philip
      entered with a noiseless tread. It was then near evening; the sun had
      broken out from the mists of the earlier day, and the wistering rays shone
      bright and holy upon the solemn place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! mother!&rdquo; sobbed the orphan, as he fell prostrate before that
      fresh green mound: &ldquo;here&mdash;here I have come to repeat my oath, to
      swear again that I will be faithful to the charge you have entrusted to
      your wretched son! And at this hour I dare ask if there be on this earth
      one more miserable and forlorn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As words to this effect struggled from his lips, a loud, shrill voice&mdash;the
      cracked, painful voice of weak age wrestling with strong passion, rose
      close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away, reprobate! thou art accursed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip started, and shuddered as if the words were addressed to himself,
      and from the grave. But, as he rose on his knee, and tossing the wild hair
      from his eyes, looked confusedly round, he saw, at a short distance, and
      in the shadow of the wall, two forms; the one, an old man with grey hair,
      who was seated on a crumbling wooden tomb, facing the setting sun; the
      other, a man apparently yet in the vigour of life, who appeared bent as in
      humble supplication. The old man&rsquo;s hands were outstretched over the head
      of the younger, as if suiting terrible action to the terrible words, and,
      after a moment&rsquo;s pause&mdash;a moment, but it seemed far longer to Philip&mdash;there
      was heard a deep, wild, ghastly howl from a dog that cowered at the old
      man&rsquo;s feet; a howl, perhaps of fear at the passion of his master, which
      the animal might associate with danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! father!&rdquo; said the suppliant reproachfully, &ldquo;your very dog rebukes
      your curse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be dumb! My dog! What hast thou left me on earth but him? Thou hast made
      me loathe the sight of friends, for thou hast made me loathe mine own
      name. Thou hast covered it with disgrace,&mdash;thou hast turned mine old
      age into a by-word,&mdash;thy crimes leave me solitary in the midst of my
      shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is many years since we met, father; we may never meet again&mdash;shall
      we part thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, aha!&rdquo; said the old man in a tone of withering sarcasm! &ldquo;I
      comprehend,&mdash;you are come for money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this taunt the son started as if stung by a serpent; raised his head to
      its full height, folded his arms, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you wrong me: for more than twenty years I have maintained myself&mdash;no
      matter how, but without taxing you;&mdash;and now, I felt remorse for
      having suffered you to discard me,&mdash;now, when you are old and
      helpless, and, I heard, blind: and you might want aid, even from your poor
      good-for-nothing son. But I have done. Forget,&mdash;not my sins, but this
      interview. Repeal your curse, father; I have enough on my head without
      yours; and so&mdash;let the son at least bless the father who curses him.
      Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker turned as he thus said, with a voice that trembled at the
      close, and brushed rapidly by Philip, whom he did not, however, appear to
      perceive; but Philip, by the last red beam of the sun, saw again that
      marked storm-beaten face which it was difficult, once seen, to forget, and
      recognised the stranger on whose breast he had slept the night of his
      fatal visit to R&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s imperfect vision did not detect the departure of his son,
      but his face changed and softened as the latter strode silently through
      the rank grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William!&rdquo; he said at last, gently; &ldquo;William!&rdquo; and the tears rolled down
      his furrowed cheeks; &ldquo;my son!&rdquo; but that son was gone&mdash;the old man
      listened for reply&mdash;none came. &ldquo;He has left me&mdash;poor William!&mdash;we
      shall never meet again;&rdquo; and he sank once more on the old tombstone, dumb,
      rigid, motionless&mdash;an image of Time himself in his own domain of
      Graves. The dog crept closer to his master, and licked his hand. Philip
      stood for a moment in thoughtful silence: his exclamation of despair had
      been answered as by his better angel. There was a being more miserable
      than himself; and the Accursed would have envied the Bereaved!
    </p>
    <p>
      The twilight had closed in; the earliest star&mdash;the star of Memory and
      Love, the Hesperus hymned by every poet since the world began&mdash;was
      fair in the arch of heaven, as Philip quitted the spot, with a spirit more
      reconciled to the future, more softened, chastened, attuned to gentle and
      pious thoughts than perhaps ever yet had made his soul dominant over the
      deep and dark tide of his gloomy passions. He went thence to a
      neighbouring sculptor, and paid beforehand for a plain tablet to be placed
      above the grave he had left. He had just quitted that shop, in the same
      street, not many doors removed from the house in which his mother had
      breathed her last. He was pausing by a crossing, irresolute whether to
      repair at once to the home assigned to Sidney, or to seek some shelter in
      town for that night, when three men who were on the opposite side of the
      way suddenly caught sight of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is&mdash;there he is! Stop, sir!&mdash;stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip heard these words, looked up, and recognised the voice and the
      person of Mr. Plaskwith; the bookseller was accompanied by Mr. Plimmins,
      and a sturdy, ill-favoured stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nameless feeling of fear, rage, and disgust seized the unhappy boy, and
      at the same moment a ragged vagabond whispered to him, &ldquo;Stump it, my cove;
      that&rsquo;s a Bow Street runner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there shot through Philip&rsquo;s mind the recollection of the money he had
      seized, though but to dash away; was he now&mdash;he, still to his own
      conviction, the heir of an ancient and spotless name&mdash;to be hunted as
      a thief; or, at the best, what right over his person and his liberty had
      he given to his taskmaster? Ignorant of the law&mdash;the law only seemed
      to him, as it ever does to the ignorant and the friendless&mdash;a Foe.
      Quicker than lightning these thoughts, which it takes so many words to
      describe, flashed through the storm and darkness of his breast; and at the
      very instant that Mr. Plimmins had laid hands on his shoulder his
      resolution was formed. The instinct of self beat loud at his heart. With a
      bound&mdash;a spring that sent Mr. Plimmins sprawling in the kennel, he
      darted across the road, and fled down an opposite lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop him! stop!&rdquo; cried the bookseller, and the officer rushed after him
      with almost equal speed. Lane after lane, alley after alley, fled Philip;
      dodging, winding, breathless, panting; and lane after lane, and alley
      after alley, thickened at his heels the crowd that pursued. The idle and
      the curious, and the officious,&mdash;ragged boys, ragged men, from stall
      and from cellar, from corner and from crossing, joined in that delicious
      chase, which runs down young Error till it sinks, too often, at the door
      of the gaol or the foot of the gallows. But Philip slackened not his pace;
      he began to distance his pursuers. He was now in a street which they had
      not yet entered&mdash;a quiet street, with few, if any, shops. Before the
      threshold of a better kind of public-house, or rather tavern, to judge by
      its appearance, lounged two men; and while Philip flew on, the cry of
      &ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; had changed as the shout passed to new voices, into &ldquo;Stop the
      thief!&rdquo;&mdash;that cry yet howled in the distance. One of the loungers
      seized him: Philip, desperate and ferocious, struck at him with all his
      force; but the blow was scarcely felt by that Herculean frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; said the man, scornfully; &ldquo;I am no spy; if you run from justice, I
      would help you to a sign-post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Struck by the voice, Philip looked hard at the speaker. It was the voice
      of the Accursed Son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me! you remember me?&rdquo; said the orphan, faintly. &ldquo;Ah! I think I do;
      poor lad! Follow me&mdash;this way!&rdquo; The stranger turned within the
      tavern, passed the hall through a sort of corridor that led into a back
      yard which opened upon a nest of courts or passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are safe for the present; I will take you where you can tell me all
      at your ease&mdash;See!&rdquo; As he spoke they emerged into an open street, and
      the guide pointed to a row of hackney coaches. &ldquo;Be quick&mdash;get in.
      Coachman, drive fast to &mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not hear the rest of the direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our story returns to Sidney.

   [&ldquo;We, replied the Iron Pot, will shield you: should any hard

   from the shock.
 ......... The Earthen Pot was the sufferer!]
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIDNEY, come here, sir! What have you been at? you have torn your frill
      into tatters! How did you do this? Come sir, no lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, ma&rsquo;am, it was not my fault. I just put my head out of the window
      to see the coach go by, and a nail caught me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you little plague! you have scratched yourself&mdash;you are always
      in mischief. What business had you to look after the coach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sidney, hanging his head ruefully. &ldquo;La, mother!&rdquo;
       cried the youngest of the cousins, a square-built, ruddy, coarse-featured
      urchin, about Sidney&rsquo;s age, &ldquo;La, mother, he never see a coach in the
      street when we are at play but he runs arter it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After, not arter,&rdquo; said Mr. Roger Morton, taking the pipe from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you go after the coaches, Sidney?&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton; &ldquo;it is very
      naughty; you will be run over some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Sidney, who during the whole colloquy had been
      trembling from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; and &lsquo;no, ma&rsquo;am:&rsquo; you have no more manners than a cobbler&rsquo;s
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease the child, my dear; he is crying,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, more
      authoritatively than usual. &ldquo;Come here, my man!&rdquo; and the worthy uncle took
      him in his lap and held his glass of brandy-and-water to his lips; Sidney,
      too frightened to refuse, sipped hurriedly, keeping his large eyes fixed
      on his aunt, as children do when they fear a cuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoil the boy more than do your own flesh and blood,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Morton, greatly displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Tom, the youngest-born before described, put his mouth to his
      mother&rsquo;s ear, and whispered loud enough to be heard by all: &ldquo;He runs arter
      the coach &lsquo;cause he thinks his ma may be in it. Who&rsquo;s home-sick, I should
      like to know? Ba! Baa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy pointed his finger over his mother&rsquo;s shoulder, and the other
      children burst into a loud giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave the room, all of you,&mdash;leave the room!&rdquo; said Mr. Morton,
      rising angrily and stamping his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children, who were in great awe of their father, huddled and hustled
      each other to the door; but Tom, who went last, bold in his mother&rsquo;s
      favour, popped his head through the doorway, and cried, &ldquo;Good-bye, little
      home-sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden slap in the face from his father changed his chuckle into a very
      different kind of music, and a loud indignant sob was heard without for
      some moments after the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way you behave to your children, Mr. Morton, I vow you
      sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have any more if I can help it. Don&rsquo;t come near me&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      touch me!&rdquo; and Mrs. Morton assumed the resentful air of offended beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; growled the spouse, and he reseated himself and resumed his pipe.
      There was a dead silence. Sidney crouched near his uncle, looking very
      pale. Mrs. Morton, who was knitting, knitted away with the excited energy
      of nervous irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring the bell, Sidney,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton. The boy obeyed&mdash;the
      parlour-maid entered. &ldquo;Take Master Sidney to his room; keep the boys away
      from him, and give him a large slice of bread and jam, Martha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jam, indeed!&mdash;treacle,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jam, Martha,&rdquo; repeated the uncle, authoritatively. &ldquo;Treacle!&rdquo; reiterated
      the aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jam, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treacle, you hear: and for that matter, Martha has no jam to give!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband had nothing more to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Sidney; there&rsquo;s a good boy, go and kiss your aunt and make
      your bow; and I say, my lad, don&rsquo;t mind those plagues. I&rsquo;ll talk to them
      to-morrow, that I will; no one shall be unkind to you in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidney muttered something, and went timidly up to Mrs. Morton. His look so
      gentle and subdued; his eyes full of tears; his pretty mouth which, though
      silent, pleaded so eloquently; his willingness to forgive, and his wish to
      be forgiven, might have melted many a heart harder, perhaps, than Mrs.
      Morton&rsquo;s. But there reigned what are worse than hardness,&mdash;prejudice
      and wounded vanity&mdash;maternal vanity. His contrast to her own rough,
      coarse children grated on her, and set the teeth of her mind on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, child, don&rsquo;t tread on my gown: you are so awkward: say your
      prayers, and don&rsquo;t throw off the counterpane! I don&rsquo;t like slovenly boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidney put his finger in his mouth, drooped, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mrs. M.,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, abruptly, and knocking out the ashes of
      his pipe; &ldquo;now Mrs. M., one word for all: I have told you that I promised
      poor Catherine to be a father to that child, and it goes to my heart to
      see him so snubbed. Why you dislike him I can&rsquo;t guess for the life of me.
      I never saw a sweeter-tempered child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, sir, go on: make your personal reflections on your own lawful
      wife. They don&rsquo;t hurt me&mdash;oh no, not at all! Sweet-tempered, indeed;
      I suppose your own children are not sweet-tempered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s neither here nor there,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton: &ldquo;my own children are
      such as God made them, and I am very well satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you may be proud of such a family; and to think of the pains I
      have taken with them, and how I have saved you in nurses, and the bad
      times I have had; and now, to find their noses put out of joint by that
      little mischief-making interloper&mdash;it is too bad of you, Mr. Morton;
      you will break my heart&mdash;that you will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton put her handkerchief to her eyes and sobbed. The husband was
      moved: he got up and attempted to take her hand. &ldquo;Indeed, Margaret, I did
      not mean to vex you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I who have been such a fa&mdash;fai&mdash;faithful wi&mdash;wi&mdash;wife,
      and brought you such a deal of mon&mdash;mon&mdash;money, and always stud&mdash;stud&mdash;studied
      your interests; many&rsquo;s the time when you have been fast asleep that I have
      sat up half the night&mdash;men&mdash;men&mdash;mending the house linen;
      and you have not been the same man, Roger, since that boy came!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well&rdquo; said the good man, quite overcome, and fairly taking her
      round the waist and kissing her; &ldquo;no words between us; it makes life quite
      unpleasant. If it pains you to have Sidney here, I will put him to some
      school in the town, where they&rsquo;ll be kind to him. Only, if you would,
      Margaret, for my sake&mdash;old girl! come, now! there&rsquo;s a darling!&mdash;just
      be more tender with him. You see he frets so after his mother. Think how
      little Tom would fret if he was away from you! Poor little Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La! Mr. Morton, you are such a man!&mdash;there&rsquo;s no resisting your ways!
      You know how to come over me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Morton smiled benignly, as she escaped from his conjugal arms and
      smoothed her cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace thus restored, Mr. Morton refilled his pipe, and the good lady,
      after a pause, resumed, in a very mild, conciliatory tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Roger, that vexes me with that there child. He
      is so deceitful, and he does tell such fibs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fibs! that is a very bad fault,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, gravely. &ldquo;That must be
      corrected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was but the other day that I saw him break a pane of glass in the
      shop; and when I taxed him with it, he denied it;&mdash;and with such a
      face! I can&rsquo;t abide storytelling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me know the next story he tells; I&rsquo;ll cure him,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton,
      sternly. &ldquo;You now how I broke Tom of it. Spare the rod, and spoil the
      child. And where I promised to be kind to the boy, of course I did not
      mean that I was not to take care of his morals, and see that he grew up an
      honest man. Tell truth and shame the devil&mdash;that&rsquo;s my motto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoke like yourself, Roger,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton, with great animation. &ldquo;But
      you see he has not had the advantage of such a father as you. I wonder
      your sister don&rsquo;t write to you. Some people make a great fuss about their
      feelings; but out of sight out of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she is not ill. Poor Catherine! she looked in a very bad way when
      she was here,&rdquo; said Morton; and he turned uneasily to the fireplace and
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the servant entered with the supper-tray, and the conversation fell
      upon other topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roger Morton&rsquo;s charge against Sidney was, alas! too true. He had
      acquired, under that roof, a terrible habit of telling stories. He had
      never incurred that vice with his mother, because then and there he had
      nothing to fear; now, he had everything to fear;&mdash;the grim aunt&mdash;even
      the quiet, kind, cold, austere uncle&mdash;the apprentices&mdash;the
      strange servants&mdash;and, oh! more than all, those hardeyed,
      loud-laughing tormentors, the boys of his own age! Naturally timid,
      severity made him actually a coward; and when the nerves tremble, a lie
      sounds as surely as, when I vibrate that wire, the bell at the end of it
      will ring. Beware of the man who has been roughly treated as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the conference just narrated, Mr. Morton, who was subject to
      erysipelas, had taken a little cooling medicine. He breakfasted,
      therefore, later than usual&mdash;after the rest of the family; and at
      this meal pour lui soulager he ordered the luxury of a muffin. Now it so
      chanced that he had only finished half the muffin, and drunk one cup of
      tea, when he was called into the shop by a customer of great importance&mdash;a
      prosy old lady, who always gave her orders with remarkable precision, and
      who valued herself on a character for affability, which she maintained by
      never buying a penny riband without asking the shopman how all his family
      were, and talking news about every other family in the place. At the time
      Mr. Morton left the parlour, Sidney and Master Tom were therein, seated on
      two stools, and casting up division sums on their respective slates&mdash;a
      point of education to which Mr. Morton attended with great care. As soon
      as his father&rsquo;s back was turned, Master Tom&rsquo;s eyes wandered from the slate
      to the muffin, as it leered at him from the slop-basin. Never did Pythian
      sibyl, seated above the bubbling spring, utter more oracular eloquence to
      her priest, than did that muffin&mdash;at least the parts of it yet extant&mdash;utter
      to the fascinated senses of Master Tom. First he sighed; then he moved
      round on his stool; then he got up; then he peered at the muffin from a
      respectful distance; then he gradually approached, and walked round, and
      round, and round it&mdash;his eyes getting bigger and bigger; then he
      peeped through the glass-door into the shop, and saw his father busily
      engaged with the old lady; then he began to calculate and philosophise,
      perhaps his father had done breakfast; perhaps he would not come back at
      all; if he came back, he would not miss one corner of the muffin; and if
      he did miss it, why should Tom be supposed to have taken it? As he thus
      communed with himself, he drew nearer into the fatal vortex, and at last
      with a desperate plunge, he seized the triangular temptation,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And ere a man had power to say &lsquo;Behold!&rsquo; 
     The jaws of Thomas had devoured it up.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Sidney, disturbed from his studies by the agitation of his companion,
      witnessed this proceeding with great and conscientious alarm. &ldquo;O Tom!&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;what will your papa say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; said Tom, putting his fist under Sidney&rsquo;s reluctant nose.
      &ldquo;If father misses it, you&rsquo;ll say the cat took it. If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;my
      eye, what a wapping I&rsquo;ll give you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Morton&rsquo;s voice was heard wishing the lady &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; and
      Master Tom, thinking it better to leave the credit of the invention solely
      to Sidney, whispered, &ldquo;Say I&rsquo;m gone up stairs for my pocket-hanker,&rdquo; and
      hastily absconded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton, already in a very bad humour, partly at the effects of the
      cooling medicine, partly at the suspension of his breakfast, stalked into
      the parlour. His tea-the second cup already poured out, was cold. He
      turned towards the muffin, and missed the lost piece at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has been at my muffin?&rdquo; said he, in a voice that seemed to Sidney
      like the voice he had always supposed an ogre to possess. &ldquo;Have you,
      Master Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;n&mdash;no, sir; indeed, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Tom has. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone up stairs for his handkerchief, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he take my muffin? Speak the truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; it was the&mdash;it was the&mdash;the cat, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O you wicked, wicked boy!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Morton, who had followed her
      husband into the parlour; &ldquo;the cat kittened last night, and is locked up
      in the coal-cellar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Master Sidney! No! first go down, Margaret, and see if the cat
      is in the cellar: it might have got out, Mrs. M.,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, just
      even in his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton went, and there was a dead silence, except indeed in Sidney&rsquo;s
      heart, which beat louder than a clock ticks. Mr. Morton, meanwhile, went
      to a little cupboard;&mdash;while still there, Mrs. Morton returned: the
      cat was in the cellar&mdash;the key turned on her&mdash;in no mood to eat
      muffins, poor thing!&mdash;she would not even lap her milk! like her
      mistress, she had had a very bad time!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now come here, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, withdrawing himself from the
      cupboard, with a small horsewhip in his hand, &ldquo;I will teach you how to
      speak the truth in future! Confess that you have told a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, it was a lie! Pray&mdash;pray forgive me: but Tom made me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! when poor Tom is up-stairs? worse and worse!&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton,
      lifting up her hands and eyes. &ldquo;What a viper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, boy,&mdash;for shame! Take that&mdash;and that&mdash;and that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Writhing&mdash;shrinking, still more terrified than hurt, the poor child
      cowered beneath the lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma! mamma!&rdquo; he cried at last, &ldquo;Oh, why&mdash;why did you leave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Mr. Morton stayed his hand, the whip fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet it is all for the boy&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;There, child, I hope
      this is the last time. There, you are not much hurt. Zounds, don&rsquo;t cry
      so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will alarm the whole street,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton; &ldquo;I never see such a
      child! Here, take this parcel to Mrs. Birnie&rsquo;s&mdash;you know the house&mdash;only
      next street, and dry your eyes before you get there. Don&rsquo;t go through the
      shop; this way out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed the child, still sobbing with a vehemence that she could not
      comprehend, through the private passage into the street, and returned to
      her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are convinced now, Mr. M.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! ma&rsquo;am; don&rsquo;t talk. But, to be sure, that&rsquo;s how I cured Tom of
      fibbing.&mdash;The tea&rsquo;s as cold as a stone!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Le bien nous le faisons: le mal c&rsquo;est la Fortune.
   On a toujours raison, le Destin toujours tort.&rdquo;&mdash;LA FONTAINE.

   [The Good, we effect ourselves; the Evil is the handiwork of
   Fortune. Mortals are always in the right, Destiny always in the
   wrong.]
</pre>
    <p>
      Upon the early morning of the day commemorated by the historical events of
      our last chapter, two men were deposited by a branch coach at the inn of a
      hamlet about ten miles distant from the town in which Mr. Roger Morton
      resided. Though the hamlet was small, the inn was large, for it was placed
      close by a huge finger-post that pointed to three great roads: one led to
      the town before mentioned; another to the heart of a manufacturing
      district; and a third to a populous seaport. The weather was fine, and the
      two travellers ordered breakfast to be taken into an arbour in the garden,
      as well as the basins and towels necessary for ablution. The elder of the
      travellers appeared to be unequivocally foreign; you would have guessed
      him at once for a German. He wore, what was then very uncommon in this
      country, a loose, brown linen blouse, buttoned to the chin, with a
      leathern belt, into which were stuck a German meerschaum and a
      tobacco-pouch. He had very long flaxen hair, false or real, that streamed
      half-way down his back, large light mustaches, and a rough, sunburnt
      complexion, which made the fairness of the hair more remarkable. He wore
      an enormous pair of green spectacles, and complained much in broken
      English of the weakness of his eyes. All about him, even to the smallest
      minutiae, indicated the German; not only the large muscular frame, the
      broad feet, and vast though well-shaped hands, but the brooch&mdash;evidently
      purchased of a Jew in some great fair&mdash;stuck ostentatiously and
      superfluously into his stock; the quaint, droll-looking carpet-bag, which
      he refused to trust to the boots; and the great, massive, dingy ring which
      he wore on his forefinger. The other was a slender, remarkably upright and
      sinewy youth, in a blue frock, over which was thrown a large cloak, a
      travelling cap, with a shade that concealed all of the upper part of his
      face, except a dark quick eye of uncommon fire; and a shawl handkerchief,
      which was equally useful in concealing the lower part of the countenance.
      On descending from the coach, the German with some difficulty made the
      ostler understand that he wanted a post-chaise in a quarter of an hour;
      and then, without entering the house, he and his friend strolled to the
      arbour. While the maid-servant was covering the table with bread, butter,
      tea, eggs, and a huge round of beef, the German was busy in washing his
      hands, and talking in his national tongue to the young man, who returned
      no answer. But as soon as the servant had completed her operations the
      foreigner turned round, and observing her eyes fixed on his brooch with
      much female admiration, he made one stride to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Der Teufel, my goot Madchen&mdash;but you are von var pretty&mdash;vat
      you call it?&rdquo; and he gave her, as he spoke, so hearty a smack that the
      girl was more flustered than flattered by the courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep yourself to yourself, sir!&rdquo; said she, very tartly, for chambermaids
      never like to be kissed by a middle-aged gentleman when a younger one is
      by: whereupon the German replied by a pinch,&mdash;it is immaterial to
      state the exact spot to which that delicate caress was directed. But this
      last offence was so inexpiable, that the &ldquo;Madchen&rdquo; bounced off with a face
      of scarlet, and a &ldquo;Sir, you are no gentleman&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you arn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
       The German thrust his head out of the arbour, and followed her with a loud
      laugh; then drawing himself in again, he said in quite another accent, and
      in excellent English, &ldquo;There, Master Philip, we have got rid of the girl
      for the rest of the morning, and that&rsquo;s exactly what I wanted to do&mdash;women&rsquo;s
      wits are confoundedly sharp. Well, did I not tell you right, we have
      baffled all the bloodhounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here, then, Gawtrey, we are to part,&rdquo; said Philip, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would think better of it, my boy,&rdquo; returned Mr. Gawtrey,
      breaking an egg; &ldquo;how can you shift for yourself&mdash;no kith nor kin,
      not even that important machine for giving advice called a friend&mdash;no,
      not a friend, when I am gone? I foresee how it must end. [D&mdash;- it,
      salt butter, by Jove!]&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were alone in the world, as I have told you again and again, perhaps
      I might pin my fate to yours. But my brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is, always wrong when we act from our feelings. My whole life,
      which some day or other I will tell you, proves that. Your brother&mdash;bah!
      is he not very well off with his own uncle and aunt?&mdash;plenty to eat
      and drink, I dare say. Come, man, you must be as hungry as a hawk&mdash;a
      slice of the beef? Let well alone, and shift for yourself. What good can
      you do your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I must see him; I have sworn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go and see him, and then strike across the country to me. I will
      wait a day for you,&mdash;there now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me first,&rdquo; said Philip, very earnestly, and fixing his dark eyes
      on his companion,&mdash;&ldquo;tell me&mdash;yes, I must speak frankly&mdash;tell
      me, you who would link my fortunes with your own,&mdash;tell me, what and
      who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you suppose?&rdquo; said he, dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear to suppose anything, lest I wrong you; but the strange place to
      which you took me the evening on which you saved me from pursuit, the
      persons I met there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well-dressed, and very civil to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! but with a certain wild looseness in their talk that&mdash;But I
      have no right to judge others by mere appearance. Nor is it this that has
      made me anxious, and, if you will, suspicious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dress&mdash;your disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disguised yourself!&mdash;ha! ha! Behold the world&rsquo;s charity! You fly
      from some danger, some pursuit, disguised&mdash;you, who hold yourself
      guiltless&mdash;I do the same, and you hold me criminal&mdash;a robber,
      perhaps&mdash;a murderer it may be! I will tell you what I am: I am a son
      of Fortune, an adventurer; I live by my wits&mdash;so do poets and
      lawyers, and all the charlatans of the world; I am a charlatan&mdash;a
      chameleon. &lsquo;Each man in his time plays many parts:&rsquo; I play any part in
      which Money, the Arch-Manager, promises me a livelihood. Are you
      satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered the boy, sadly, &ldquo;when I know more of the world, I
      shall understand you better. Strange&mdash;strange, that you, out of all
      men, should have been kind to me in distress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all strange. Ask the beggar whom he gets the most pence from&mdash;the
      fine lady in her carriage&mdash;the beau smelling of eau de Cologne? Pish!
      the people nearest to being beggars themselves keep the beggar alive. You
      were friendless, and the man who has all earth for a foe befriends you. It
      is the way of the world, sir,&mdash;the way of the world. Come, eat while
      you can; this time next year you may have no beef to your bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus masticating and moralising at the same time, Mr. Gawtrey at last
      finished a breakfast that would have astonished the whole Corporation of
      London; and then taking out a large old watch, with an enamelled back&mdash;doubtless
      more German than its master&mdash;he said, as he lifted up his carpet-bag,
      &ldquo;I must be off&mdash;tempos fugit, and I must arrive just in time to nick
      the vessels. Shall get to Ostend, or Rotterdam, safe and snug; thence to
      Paris. How my pretty Fan will have grown! Ah, you don&rsquo;t know Fan&mdash;make
      you a nice little wife one of these days! Cheer up, man, we shall meet
      again. Be sure of it; and hark ye, that strange place, as you call it,
      where I took you,&mdash;you can find it again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, then, is the address. Whenever you want me, go there, ask to see
      Mr. Gregg&mdash;old fellow with one eye, you recollect&mdash;shake him by
      the hand just so&mdash;you catch the trick&mdash;practise it again. No,
      the forefinger thus, that&rsquo;s right. Say &lsquo;blater,&rsquo; no more&mdash;&lsquo;blater;&rsquo;&mdash;stay,
      I will write it down for you; and then ask for William Gawtrey&rsquo;s
      direction. He will give it you at once, without questions&mdash;these
      signs understood; and if you want money for your passage, he will give you
      that also, with advice into the bargain. Always a warm welcome with me.
      And so take care of yourself, and good-bye. I see my chaise is at the
      door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Gawtrey shook the young man&rsquo;s hand with cordial vigour, and
      strode off to his chaise, muttering, &ldquo;Money well laid out&mdash;fee money;
      I shall have him, and, Gad, I like him,&mdash;poor devil!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;He is a cunning coachman that can turn well in a narrow room.&rdquo;
    Old Play: from Lamb&rsquo;s Specimens.

   &ldquo;Here are two pilgrims,
   And neither knows one footstep of the way.&rdquo;

</pre>
    <p>
      The chaise had scarce driven from the inn-door when a coach stopped to
      change horses on its last stage to the town to which Philip was, bound.
      The name of the destination, in gilt letters on the coach-door, caught his
      eye, as he walked from the arbour towards the road, and in a few moments
      he was seated as the fourth passenger in the &ldquo;Nelson Slow and Sure.&rdquo; From
      under the shade of his cap, he darted that quick, quiet glance, which a
      man who hunts, or is hunted,&mdash;in other words, who observes, or shuns,&mdash;soon
      acquires. At his left hand sat a young woman in a cloak lined with yellow;
      she had taken off her bonnet and pinned it to the roof of the coach, and
      looked fresh and pretty in a silk handkerchief, which she had tied round
      her head, probably to serve as a nightcap during the drowsy length of the
      journey. Opposite to her was a middle-aged man of pale complexion, and a
      grave, pensive, studious expression of face; and vis-a-vis to Philip sat
      an overdressed, showy, very good-looking man of about two or three and
      forty. This gentleman wore auburn whiskers, which met at the chin; a
      foraging cap, with a gold tassel; a velvet waistcoat, across which, in
      various folds, hung a golden chain, at the end of which dangled an
      eye-glass, that from time to time he screwed, as it were, into his right
      eye; he wore, also, a blue silk stock, with a frill much crumpled, dirty
      kid gloves, and over his lap lay a cloak lined with red silk. As Philip
      glanced towards this personage, the latter fixed his glass also at him,
      with a scrutinising stare, which drew fire from Philip&rsquo;s dark eyes. The
      man dropped his glass, and said in a half provincial, half haw-haw tone,
      like the stage exquisite of a minor theatre, &ldquo;Pawdon me, and split legs!&rdquo;
       therewith stretching himself between Philip&rsquo;s limbs in the approved
      fashion of inside passengers. A young man in a white great-coat now came
      to the door with a glass of warm sherry and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take this&mdash;you must now; it will keep the cold out,&rdquo; (the
      day was broiling,) said he to the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious me!&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but I never drink wine of a morning,
      James; it will get into my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To oblige me!&rdquo; said the young man, sentimentally; whereupon the young
      lady took the glass, and looking very kindly at her Ganymede, said, &ldquo;Your
      health!&rdquo; and sipped, and made a wry face&mdash;then she looked at the
      passengers, tittered, and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear wine!&rdquo; and so, very slowly
      and daintily, sipped up the rest. A silent and expressive squeeze of the
      hand, on returning the glass, rewarded the young man, and proved the
      salutary effect of his prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cried the coachman: the ostler twitched the cloths from the
      leaders, and away went the &ldquo;Nelson Slow and Sure,&rdquo; with as much pretension
      as if it had meant to do the ten miles in an hour. The pale gentleman took
      from his waistcoat pocket a little box containing gum-arabic, and having
      inserted a couple of morsels between his lips, he next drew forth a little
      thin volume, which from the manner the lines were printed was evidently
      devoted to poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smart gentleman, who since the episode of the sherry and water had
      kept his glass fixed upon the young lady, now said, with a genteel smirk:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young gentleman seems very auttentive, miss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very good young man, sir, and takes great care of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your brother, miss,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La, sir&mdash;why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No faumily likeness&mdash;noice-looking fellow enough! But your oiyes and
      mouth&mdash;ah, miss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss turned away her head, and uttered with pert vivacity: &ldquo;I never likes
      compliments, sir! But the young man is not my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sweetheart,&mdash;eh? Oh fie, miss! Haw! haw!&rdquo; and the auburn-whiskered
      Adonis poked Philip in the knee with one hand, and the pale gentleman in
      the ribs with the other. The latter looked up, and reproachfully; the
      former drew in his legs, and uttered an angry ejaculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, there is no harm in a sweetheart, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None in the least, ma&rsquo;am; I advoise you to double the dose. We often hear
      of two strings to a bow. Daun&rsquo;t you think it would be noicer to have two
      beaux to your string?&rdquo; As he thus wittily expressed himself, the gentleman
      took off his cap, and thrust his fingers through a very curling and comely
      head of hair; the young lady looked at him with evident coquetry, and
      said, &ldquo;How you do run on, you gentlemen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may well run on, miss, as long as I run aufter you,&rdquo; was the gallant
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the pale gentleman, evidently annoyed by being talked across, shut
      his book up, and looked round. His eye rested on Philip, who, whether from
      the heat of the day or from the forgetfulness of thought, had pushed his
      cap from his brows; and the gentleman, after staring at him for a few
      moments with great earnestness, sighed so heavily that it attracted the
      notice of all the passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you unwell, sir?&rdquo; asked the young lady, compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little pain in my side, nothing more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chaunge places with me, sir,&rdquo; cried the Lothario, officiously. &ldquo;Now do!&rdquo;
       The pale gentleman, after a short hesitation, and a bashful excuse,
      accepted the proposal. In a few moments the young lady and the beau were
      in deep and whispered conversation, their heads turned towards the window.
      The pale gentleman continued to gaze at Philip, till the latter,
      perceiving the notice he excited, coloured, and replaced his cap over his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to N&mdash;&mdash;? asked the gentleman, in a gentle, timid
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it the first time you have ever been there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; returned Philip, in a voice that spoke surprise and distaste at his
      neighbour&rsquo;s curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said the gentleman, shrinking back; &ldquo;but you remind me of-of&mdash;a
      family I once knew in the town. Do you know&mdash;the&mdash;the Mortons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One in Philip&rsquo;s situation, with, as he supposed, the officers of justice
      in his track (for Gawtrey, for reasons of his own, rather encouraged than
      allayed his fears), might well be suspicious. He replied therefore
      shortly, &ldquo;I am quite a stranger to the town,&rdquo; and ensconced himself in the
      corner, as if to take a nap. Alas! that answer was one of the many
      obstacles he was doomed to build up between himself and a fairer fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman sighed again, and never spoke more to the end of the
      journey. When the coach halted at the inn,&mdash;the same inn which had
      before given its shelter to poor Catherine,&mdash;the young man in the
      white coat opened the door, and offered his arm to the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you make any stay here, sir?&rdquo; said she to the beau, as she unpinned
      her bonnet from the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so; I am waiting for my phe-a-ton, which my faellow is to bring
      down,&mdash;tauking a little tour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be very happy to see you, sir!&rdquo; said the young lady, on whom the
      phe-a-ton completed the effect produced by the gentleman&rsquo;s previous
      gallantries; and with that she dropped into his hand a very neat card, on
      which was printed, &ldquo;Wavers and Snow, Staymakers, High Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beau put the card gracefully into his pocket&mdash;leaped from the
      coach&mdash;nudged aside his rival of the white coat, and offered his arm
      to the lady, who leaned on it affectionately as she descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman has been so perlite to me, James,&rdquo; said she. James touched
      his hat; the beau clapped him on the shoulder,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! you are not a
      hauppy man,&mdash;are you? Oh no, not at all a hauppy man!&mdash;Good day
      to you! Guard, that hat-box is mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Philip was paying the coachman, the beau passed, and whispered him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recollect old Gregg&mdash;anything on the lay here&mdash;don&rsquo;t spoil my
      sport if we meet!&rdquo; and bustled off into the inn, whistling &ldquo;God save the
      king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip started, then tried to bring to mind the faces which he had seen at
      the &ldquo;strange place,&rdquo; and thought he recalled the features of his
      fellow-traveller. However, he did not seek to renew the acquaintance, but
      inquired the way to Mr. Morton&rsquo;s house, and thither he now proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was directed, as a short cut, down one of those narrow passages at the
      entrance of which posts are placed as an indication that they are
      appropriated solely to foot-passengers. A dead white wall, which screened
      the garden of the physician of the place, ran on one side; a high fence to
      a nursery-ground was on the other; the passage was lonely, for it was now
      the hour when few persons walk either for business or pleasure in a
      provincial town, and no sound was heard save the fall of his own step on
      the broad flagstones. At the end of the passage in the main street to
      which it led, he saw already the large, smart, showy shop, with the hot
      sum shining full on the gilt letters that conveyed to the eyes of the
      customer the respectable name of &ldquo;Morton,&rdquo;&mdash;when suddenly the silence
      was broken by choked and painful sobs. He turned, and beneath a compo
      portico, jutting from the wall, which adorned the physician&rsquo;s door, he saw
      a child seated on the stone steps weeping bitterly&mdash;a thrill shot
      through Philip&rsquo;s heart! Did he recognise, disguised as it was by pain and
      sorrow, that voice? He paused, and laid his hand on the child&rsquo;s shoulder:
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t&mdash;I am going, I am indeed:&rdquo;
       cried the child, quailing, and still keeping his hands clasped before his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney!&rdquo; said Philip. The boy started to his feet, uttered a cry of
      rapturous joy, and fell upon his brother&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Philip!&mdash;dear, dear Philip! you are come to take me away back to
      my own&mdash;own mamma; I will be so good, I will never tease her again,&mdash;never,
      never! I have been so wretched!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, and tell me what they have done to you,&rdquo; said Philip, checking
      the rising heart that heaved at his mother&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, there they sat, on the cold stone under the stranger&rsquo;s porch, these
      two orphans: Philip&rsquo;s arms round his brother&rsquo;s waist, Sidney leaning on
      his shoulder, and imparting to him&mdash;perhaps with pardonable
      exaggeration, all the sufferings he had gone through; and, when he came to
      that morning&rsquo;s chastisement, and showed the wale across the little hands
      which he had vainly held up in supplication, Philip&rsquo;s passion shook him
      from limb to limb. His impulse was to march straight into Mr. Morton&rsquo;s
      shop and gripe him by the throat; and the indignation he betrayed
      encouraged Sidney to colour yet more highly the tale of his wrongs and
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had done, and clinging tightly to his brother&rsquo;s broad chest, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But never mind, Philip; now we will go home to mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, my dear brother. We cannot go back to our mother. I will
      tell you why, later. We are alone in the world&mdash;we two! If you will
      come with me&mdash;God help you!&mdash;for you will have many hardships:
      we shall have to work and drudge, and you may be cold and hungry, and
      tired, very often, Sidney,&mdash;very, very often! But you know that, long
      ago, when I was so passionate, I never was wilfully unkind to you; and I
      declare now, that I would bite out my tongue rather than it should say a
      harsh word to you. That is all I can promise. Think well. Will you never
      miss all the comforts you have now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comforts!&rdquo; repeated Sidney, ruefully, and looking at the wale over his
      hands. &ldquo;Oh! let&mdash;let&mdash;let me go with you, I shall die if I stay
      here. I shall indeed&mdash;indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Philip; for at that moment a step was heard, and the pale
      gentleman walked slowly down the passage, and started, and turned his head
      wistfully as he looked at the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone. Philip rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is settled, then,&rdquo; said he, firmly. &ldquo;Come with me at once. You shall
      return to their roof no more. Come, quick: we shall have many miles to go
      to-night.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;He comes&mdash;
     Yet careless what he brings; his one concern
     Is to conduct it to the destined inn;
     And having dropp&rsquo;d the expected bag, pass on&mdash;
     To him indifferent whether grief or joy.&rdquo;
              COWPER: Description of the Postman.
</pre>
    <p>
      The pale gentleman entered Mr. Morton&rsquo;s shop; and, looking round him,
      spied the worthy trader showing shawls to a young lady just married. He
      seated himself on a stool, and said to the bowing foreman&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait till Mr. Morton is disengaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady having closely examined seven shawls, and declared they
      were beautiful, said, &ldquo;she would think of it,&rdquo; and walked away. Mr. Morton
      now approached the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said the pale gentleman; &ldquo;you are very little altered. You
      do not recollect me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, Mr. Spencer! is it really you? Well, what a time since we met!
      I am very glad to see you. And what brings you to N&mdash;&mdash;?
      Business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, business. Let us go within?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton led the way to the parlour, where Master Tom, reperched on the
      stool, was rapidly digesting the plundered muffin. Mr. Morton dismissed
      him to play, and the pale gentleman took a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morton,&rdquo; said he, glancing over his dress, &ldquo;you see I am in mourning.
      It is for your sister. I never got the better of that early attachment&mdash;never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister! Good Heavens!&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, turning very pale; &ldquo;is she
      dead? Poor Catherine!&mdash;and I not know of it! When did she die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many days since; and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, greatly
      affected, &ldquo;I fear in want. I had been abroad for some months: on my return
      last week, looking over the newspapers (for I always order them to be
      filed), I read the short account of her lawsuit against Mr. Beaufort, some
      time back. I resolved to find her out. I did so through the solicitor she
      employed: it was too late; I arrived at her lodgings two days after her&mdash;her
      burial. I then determined to visit poor Catherine&rsquo;s brother, and learn if
      anything could be done for the children she had left behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She left but two. Philip, the elder, is very comfortably placed at R&mdash;&mdash;;
      the younger has his home with me; and Mrs. Morton is a moth&mdash;that is
      to say, she takes great pains with him. Ehem! And my poor&mdash;poor
      sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he like his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much, when she was young&mdash;poor dear Catherine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What age is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About ten, perhaps; I don&rsquo;t know exactly; much younger than the other.
      And so she&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morton, I am an old bachelor&rdquo; (here a sickly smile crossed Mr.
      Spencer&rsquo;s face); &ldquo;a small portion of my fortune is settled, it is true, on
      my relations; but the rest is mine, and I live within my income. The elder
      of these boys is probably old enough to begin to take care of himself.
      But, the younger&mdash;perhaps you have a family of your own, and can
      spare him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton hesitated, and twitched up his trousers. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this
      is very kind in you. I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see. The boy is out now;
      come and dine with us at two&mdash;pot-luck. Well, so she is no more!
      Heigho! Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll talk it over with Mrs. M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be with you,&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Mr. Morton, &ldquo;if Catherine had but married you she would have
      been a happy woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have tried to make her so,&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, as he turned away
      his face and took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two o&rsquo;clock came; but no Sidney. They had sent to the place whither he had
      been despatched; he had never arrived there. Mr. Morton grew alarmed; and,
      when Mr. Spencer came to dinner, his host was gone in search of the
      truant. He did not return till three. Doomed that day to be belated both
      at breakfast and dinner, this decided him to part with Sidney whenever he
      should be found. Mrs. Morton was persuaded that the child only sulked, and
      would come back fast enough when he was hungry. Mr. Spencer tried to
      believe her, and ate his mutton, which was burnt to a cinder; but when
      five, six, seven o&rsquo;clock came, and the boy was still missing,&mdash;even
      Mrs. Morton agreed that it was high time to institute a regular search.
      The whole family set off different ways. It was ten o&rsquo;clock before they
      were reunited; and then all the news picked up was, that a boy, answering
      Sidney&rsquo;s description, had been seen with a young man in three several
      parts of the town; the last time at the outskirts, on the high road
      towards the manufacturing districts. These tidings so far relieved Mr.
      Morton&rsquo;s mind that he dismissed the chilling fear that had crept there,&mdash;that
      Sidney might have drowned himself. Boys will drown themselves sometimes!
      The description of the young man coincided so remarkably with the
      fellow-passenger of Mr. Spencer, that he did not doubt it was the same;
      the more so when he recollected having seen him with a fair-haired child
      under the portico; and yet more, when he recalled the likeness to
      Catherine that had struck him in the coach, and caused the inquiry that
      had roused Philip&rsquo;s suspicion. The mystery was thus made clear&mdash;Sidney
      had fled with his brother. Nothing more, however, could be done that
      night. The next morning, active measures should be devised; and when the
      morning came, the mail brought to Mr. Morton the two following letters.
      The first was from Arthur Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR,&mdash;I have been prevented by severe illness from writing to you
      before. I can now scarcely hold a pen; but the instant my health is
      recovered I shall be with you at N &mdash;&mdash;, on her deathbed, the
      mother of the boy under your charge, Sidney Morton, committed him solemnly
      to me. I make his fortunes my care, and shall hasten to claim him at your
      kindly hands. But the elder son,&mdash;this poor Philip, who has suffered
      so unjustly,&mdash;for our lawyer has seen Mr. Plaskwith, and heard the
      whole story&mdash;what has become of him? All our inquiries have failed to
      track him. Alas, I was too ill to institute them myself while it was yet
      time. Perhaps he may have sought shelter, with you, his uncle; if so,
      assure him that he is in no danger from the pursuit of the law,&mdash;that
      his innocence is fully recognised; and that my father and myself implore
      him to accept our affection. I can write no more now; but in a few days I
      shall hope to see you.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;I am, sir, &amp;c.,
            &ldquo;ARTHUR BEAUFORT.
   &ldquo;Berkely Square.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The second letter was from Mr. Plaskwith, and ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MORTON,&mdash;Something very awkward has happened,&mdash;not my
      fault, and very unpleasant for me. Your relation, Philip, as I wrote you
      word, was a painstaking lad, though odd and bad mannered,&mdash;for want,
      perhaps, poor boy! of being taught better, and Mrs. P. is, you know, a
      very genteel woman&mdash;women go too much by manners&mdash;so she never
      took much to him. However, to the point, as the French emperor used to
      say: one evening he asked me for money for his mother, who, he said, was
      ill, in a very insolent way: I may say threatening. It was in my own shop,
      and before Plimmins and Mrs. P.; I was forced to answer with dignified
      rebuke, and left the shop. When I returned, he was gone, and some
      shillings-fourteen, I think, and three sovereigns&mdash;evidently from the
      till, scattered on the floor. Mrs. P. and Mr. Plimmins were very much
      frightened; thought it was clear I was robbed, and that we were to be
      murdered. Plimmins slept below that night, and we borrowed butcher
      Johnson&rsquo;s dog. Nothing happened. I did not think I was robbed; because the
      money, when we came to calculate, was all right. I know human nature. He
      had thought to take it, but repented&mdash;quite clear. However, I was
      naturally very angry, thought he&rsquo;d comeback again&mdash;meant to reprove
      him properly&mdash;waited several days&mdash;heard nothing of him&mdash;grew
      uneasy&mdash;would not attend longer to Mrs. P.; for, as Napoleon
      Buonaparte observed, &lsquo;women are well in their way, not in ours.&rsquo; Made
      Plimmins go with me to town&mdash;hired a Bow Street runner to track him
      out&mdash;cost me L1. 1s, and two glasses of brandy and water. Poor Mrs.
      Morton was just buried&mdash;quite shocked! Suddenly saw the boy in the
      streets. Plimmins rushed forward in the kindest way&mdash;was knocked down&mdash;hurt
      his arm&mdash;paid 2s. 6d. for lotion. Philip ran off, we ran after him&mdash;could
      not find him. Forced to return home. Next day, a lawyer from a Mr.
      Beaufort&mdash;Mr. George Blackwell, a gentlemanlike man called. Mr.
      Beaufort will do anything for him in reason. Is there anything more I can
      do? I really am very uneasy about the lad, and Mrs. P. and I have a tiff
      about it: but that&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;thought I had best write to you for
      instructions.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;Yours truly,
          &ldquo;C. PLASHWITH.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;Just open my letter to say, Bow Street officer just been here&mdash;has
      found out that the boy has been seen with a very suspicious character:
      they think he has left London. Bow Street officer wants to go after him&mdash;very
      expensive: so now you can decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spencer scarcely listened to Mr. Plaskwith&rsquo;s letter, but of Arthur&rsquo;s
      he felt jealous. He would fain have been the only protector to Catherine&rsquo;s
      children; but he was the last man fitted to head the search, now so
      necessary to prosecute with equal tact and energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft-hearted, soft-headed man, a confirmed valtudinarian, a day-dreamer,
      who had wasted away his life in dawdling and maundering over Simple
      Poetry, and sighing over his unhappy attachment; no child, no babe, was
      more thoroughly helpless than Mr. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of investigation devolved, therefore, on Mr. Morton, and he went
      about it in a regular, plain, straightforward way. Hand-bills were
      circulated, constables employed, and a lawyer, accompanied by Mr. Spencer,
      despatched to the manufacturing districts: towards which the orphans had
      been seen to direct their path.

      Meanwhile the brothers were far away, and He who feeds the young ravens
      made their paths pleasant to their feet. Philip had broken to Sidney the
      sad news of their mother&rsquo;s death, and Sidney had wept with bitter passion.
      But children,&mdash;what can they know of death? Their tears over graves
      dry sooner than the dews. It is melancholy to compare the depth, the
      endurance, the far-sighted, anxious, prayerful love of a parent, with the
      inconsiderate, frail, and evanescent affection of the infant, whose eyes
      the hues of the butterfly yet dazzle with delight. It was the night of
      their flight, and in the open air, when Philip (his arms round Sidney&rsquo;s
      waist) told his brother-orphan that they were motherless. And the air was
      balmy, the skies filled with the effulgent presence of the August moon;
      the cornfields stretched round them wide and far, and not a leaf trembled
      on the beech-tree beneath which they had sought shelter. It seemed as if
      Nature herself smiled pityingly on their young sorrow, and said to them,
      &ldquo;Grieve not for the dead: I, who live for ever, I will be your mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crept, as the night deepened, into the warmer sleeping-place afforded
      by stacks of hay, mown that summer and still fragrant. And the next
      morning the birds woke them betimes, to feel that Liberty, at least, was
      with them, and to wander with her at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who in his boyhood has not felt the delight of freedom and adventure? to
      have the world of woods and sward before him&mdash;to escape restriction&mdash;to
      lean, for the first time, on his own resources&mdash;to rejoice in the
      wild but manly luxury of independence&mdash;to act the Crusoe&mdash;and to
      fancy a Friday in every footprint&mdash;an island of his own in every
      field? Yes, in spite of their desolation, their loss, of the melancholy
      past, of the friendless future, the orphans were happy&mdash;happy in
      their youth&mdash;their freedom&mdash;their love&mdash;their wanderings in
      the delicious air of the glorious August. Sometimes they came upon knots
      of reapers lingering in the shade of the hedge-rows over their noonday
      meal; and, grown sociable by travel, and bold by safety, they joined and
      partook of the rude fare with the zest of fatigue and youth. Sometimes,
      too, at night, they saw, gleam afar and red by the woodside, the fires of
      gipsy tents. But these, with the superstition derived from old
      nursery-tales, they scrupulously shunned, eying them with a mysterious
      awe! What heavenly twilights belong to that golden month!&mdash;the air so
      lucidly serene, as the purple of the clouds fades gradually away, and up
      soars, broad, round, intense, and luminous, the full moon which belongs to
      the joyous season! The fields then are greener than in the heats of July
      and June,&mdash;they have got back the luxury of a second spring. And
      still, beside the paths of the travellers, lingered on the hedges the
      clustering honeysuckle&mdash;the convolvulus glittered in the tangles of
      the brake&mdash;the hardy heathflower smiled on the green waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      And ever, at evening, they came, field after field, upon those circles
      which recall to children so many charmed legends, and are fresh and
      frequent in that month&mdash;the Fairy Rings! They thought, poor boys!
      that it was a good omen, and half fancied that the Fairies protected them,
      as in the old time they had often protected the desolate and outcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      They avoided the main roads, and all towns, with suspicious care. But
      sometimes they paused, for food and rest, at the obscure hostel of some
      scattered hamlet: though, more often, they loved to spread the simple food
      they purchased by the way under some thick tree, or beside a stream
      through whose limpid waters they could watch the trout glide and play. And
      they often preferred the chance shelter of a haystack, or a shed, to the
      less romantic repose offered by the small inns they alone dared to enter.
      They went in this much by the face and voice of the host or hostess. Once
      only Philip had entered a town, on the second day of their flight, and
      that solely for the purchase of ruder clothes, and a change of linen for
      Sidney, with some articles and implements of use necessary in their
      present course of shift and welcome hardship. A wise precaution; for, thus
      clad, they escaped suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      So journeying, they consumed several days; and, having taken a direction
      quite opposite to that which led to the manufacturing districts, whither
      pursuit had been directed, they were now in the centre of another county&mdash;in
      the neighbourhood of one of the most considerable towns of England; and
      here Philip began to think their wanderings ought to cease, and it was
      time to settle on some definite course of life. He had carefully hoarded
      about his person, and most thriftily managed, the little fortune
      bequeathed by his mother. But Philip looked on this capital as a deposit
      sacred to Sidney; it was not to be spent, but kept and augmented&mdash;the
      nucleus for future wealth. Within the last few weeks his character was
      greatly ripened, and his powers of thought enlarged. He was no more a boy,&mdash;he
      was a man: he had another life to take care of. He resolved, then, to
      enter the town they were approaching, and to seek for some situation by
      which he might maintain both. Sidney was very loath to abandon their
      present roving life; but he allowed that the warm weather could not always
      last, and that in winter the fields would be less pleasant. He, therefore,
      with a sigh, yielded to his brother&rsquo;s reasonings.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the fair and busy town of one day at noon; and, after finding
      a small lodging, at which he deposited Sidney, who was fatigued with their
      day&rsquo;s walk, Philip sallied forth alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his long rambling, Philip was pleased and struck with the broad
      bustling streets, the gay shops&mdash;the evidences of opulence and trade.
      He thought it hard if he could not find there a market for the health and
      heart of sixteen. He strolled slowly and alone along the streets, till his
      attention was caught by a small corner shop, in the window of which was
      placed a board, bearing this inscription:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OFFICE FOR EMPLOYMENT.&mdash;RECIPROCAL ADVANTAGE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. John Clump&rsquo;s bureau open every day, from ten till four. Clerks,
      servants, labourers, &amp;c., provided with suitable situations. Terms
      moderate. N.B.&mdash;The oldest established office in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted, a good cook. An under gardener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he sought was here! Philip entered, and saw a short fat man with
      spectacles, seated before a desk, poring upon the well-filled leaves of a
      long register.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;I wish for a situation. I don&rsquo;t care what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-a-crown for entry, if you please. That&rsquo;s right. Now for particulars.
      Hum!&mdash;you don&rsquo;t look like a servant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I wish for any place where my education can be of use. I can read and
      write; I know Latin and French; I can draw; I know arithmetic and
      summing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; very genteel young man&mdash;prepossessing appearance (that&rsquo;s
      a fudge!), highly educated; usher in a school, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;References?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&mdash;none?&rdquo; and Mr. Clump fixed his spectacles full upon Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was prepared for the question, and had the sense to perceive that a
      frank reply was his best policy. &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said he boldly, &ldquo;I was
      well brought up; my father died; I was to be bound apprentice to a trade I
      disliked; I left it, and have now no friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can help you, I will,&rdquo; said Mr. Clump, coldly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t promise much.
      If you were a labourer, character might not matter; but educated young men
      must have a character. Hands always more useful than head. Education no
      avail nowadays; common, quite common. Call again on Monday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat disappointed and chilled, Philip turned from the bureau; but he
      had a strong confidence in his own resources, and recovered his spirits as
      he mingled with the throng. He passed, at length, by a livery-stable, and
      paused, from old associations, as he saw a groom in the mews attempting to
      manage a young, hot horse, evidently unbroken. The master of the stables,
      in a green short jacket and top-boots, with a long whip in his hand, was
      standing by, with one or two men who looked like horsedealers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come off, clumsy! you can&rsquo;t manage that I &lsquo;ere fine hanimal,&rdquo; cried the
      liveryman. &ldquo;Ah! he&rsquo;s a lamb, sir, if he were backed properly. But I has
      not a man in the yard as can ride since Will died. Come off, I say,
      lubber!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to come off, without being thrown off, was more easily said than done.
      The horse was now plunging as if Juno had sent her gadfly to him; and
      Philip, interested and excited, came nearer and nearer, till he stood by
      the side of the horse-dealers. The other ostlers ran to the help of their
      comrade, who at last, with white lips and shaking knees, found himself on
      terra firma; while the horse, snorting hard, and rubbing his head against
      the breast and arms of the ostler, who held him tightly by the rein,
      seemed to ask, in his own way, &ldquo;Are there any more of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A suspicion that the horse was an old acquaintance crossed Philip&rsquo;s mind;
      he went up to him, and a white spot over the left eye confirmed his
      doubts. It had been a foal reserved and reared for his own riding! one
      that, in his prosperous days, had ate bread from his hand, and followed
      him round the paddock like a dog; one that he had mounted in sport,
      without saddle, when his father&rsquo;s back was turned; a friend, in short, of
      the happy Lang syne;&mdash;nay, the very friend to whom he had boasted his
      affection, when, standing with Arthur Beaufort under the summer sky, the
      whole world seemed to him full of friends. He put his hand on the horse&rsquo;s
      neck, and whispered, &ldquo;Soho! So, Billy!&rdquo; and the horse turned sharp round
      with a quick joyous neigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said Philip, appealing to the liveryman, &ldquo;I will
      undertake to ride this horse, and take him over yon leaping-bar. Just let
      me try him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fine-spirited lad for you!&rdquo; said the liveryman, much pleased at
      the offer. &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, did I not tell you that &lsquo;ere hanimal had no
      vice if he was properly managed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse-dealers shook their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I give him some bread first?&rdquo; asked Philip; and the ostler was
      despatched to the house. Meanwhile the animal evinced various signs of
      pleasure and recognition, as Philip stroked and talked to him; and,
      finally, when he ate the bread from the young man&rsquo;s hand, the whole yard
      seemed in as much delight and surprise as if they had witnessed one of
      Monsieur Van Amburgh&rsquo;s exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Philip, still caressing the horse, slowly and cautiously mounted;
      the animal made one bound half-across the yard&mdash;a bound which sent
      all the horse-dealers into a corner&mdash;and then went through his paces,
      one after the other, with as much ease and calm as if he had been broken
      in at Mr. Fozard&rsquo;s to carry a young lady. And when he crowned all by going
      thrice over the leaping-bar, and Philip, dismounting, threw the reins to
      the ostler, and turned triumphantly to the horse-dealer, that gentleman
      slapped him on the back, and said, emphatically, &ldquo;Sir, you are a man! and
      I am proud to see you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the horse-dealers gathered round the animal; looked at his
      hoofs, felt his legs, examined his windpipe, and concluded the bargain,
      which, but for Philip, would have been very abruptly broken off. When the
      horse was led out of the yard, the liveryman, Mr. Stubmore, turned to
      Philip, who, leaning against the wall, followed the poor animal with
      mournful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good sir, you have sold that horse for me&mdash;that you have!
      Anything as I can do for you? One good turn de serves another. Here&rsquo;s a
      brace of shiners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir! I want no money, but I do want some employment. I can be
      of use to you, perhaps, in your establishment. I have been brought up
      among horses all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw it, sir! that&rsquo;s very clear. I say, that &lsquo;ere horse knows you!&rdquo; and
      the dealer put his finger to his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right to be mum! He was bred by an old customer of mine&mdash;famous
      rider!&mdash;Mr. Beaufort. Aha! that&rsquo;s where you knew him, I s&rsquo;pose. Were
      you in his stables?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem&mdash;I knew Mr. Beaufort well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? You could not know a better man. Well, I shall be very glad to
      engage you, though you seem by your hands to be a bit of a gentleman&mdash;eh?
      Never mind; don&rsquo;t want you to groom!&mdash;but superintend things. D&rsquo;ye
      know accounts, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip repeated to Mr. Stubmore the story he had imparted to Mr. Clump.
      Somehow or other, men who live much with horses are always more lax in
      their notions than the rest of mankind. Mr. Stubmore did not seem to grow
      more distant at Philip&rsquo;s narration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand you perfectly, my man. Brought up with them &lsquo;ere fine creturs,
      how could you nail your nose to a desk? I&rsquo;ll take you without more
      palaver. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to-morrow, and we&rsquo;ll settle about wages. Sleep here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have a brother whom I must lodge with, and for whose sake I wish to
      work. I should not like him to be at the stables&mdash;he is too young.
      But I can come early every day, and go home late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just as you like, my man. Good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus, not from any mental accomplishment&mdash;not from the result of
      his intellectual education, but from the mere physical capacity and brute
      habit of sticking fast on his saddle, did Philip Morton, in this great,
      intelligent, gifted, civilised, enlightened community of Great Britain,
      find the means of earning his bread without stealing it.

    <p>
      Phillip&rsquo;s situation was agreeable to his habits. His great courage and
      skill in horsemanship were not the only qualifications useful to Mr.
      Stubmore: his education answered a useful purpose in accounts, and his
      manners and appearance were highly to the credit of the yard. The
      customers and loungers soon grew to like Gentleman Philips, as he was
      styled in the establishment. Mr. Stubmore conceived a real affection for
      him. So passed several weeks; and Philip, in this humble capacity, might
      have worked out his destinies in peace and comfort, but for a new cause of
      vexation that arose in Sidney. This boy was all in all to his brother. For
      him he had resisted the hearty and joyous invitations of Gawtrey (whose
      gay manner and high spirits had, it must be owned, captivated his fancy,
      despite the equivocal mystery of the man&rsquo;s avocations and condition); for
      him he now worked and toiled, cheerful and contented; and him he sought to
      save from all to which he subjected himself. He could not bear that that
      soft and delicate child should ever be exposed to the low and menial
      associations that now made up his own life&mdash;to the obscene slang of
      grooms and ostlers&mdash;to their coarse manners and rough contact. He
      kept him, therefore, apart and aloof in their little lodging, and hoped in
      time to lay by, so that Sidney might ultimately be restored, if not to his
      bright original sphere, at least to a higher grade than that to which
      Philip was himself condemned. But poor Sidney could not bear to be thus
      left alone&mdash;to lose sight of his brother from daybreak till bed-time&mdash;to
      have no one to amuse him; he fretted and pined away: all the little
      inconsiderate selfishness, uneradicated from his breast by his sufferings,
      broke out the more, the more he felt that he was the first object on earth
      to Philip. Philip, thinking he might be more cheerful at a day-school,
      tried the experiment of placing him at one where the boys were much of his
      own age. But Sidney, on the third day, came back with a black eye, and he
      would return no more. Philip several times thought of changing their
      lodging for one where there were young people. But Sidney had taken a
      fancy to the kind old widow who was their landlady, and cried at the
      thought of removal. Unfortunately, the old woman was deaf and rheumatic;
      and though she bore teasing ad libitum, she could not entertain the child
      long on a stretch. Too young to be reasonable, Sidney could not, or would
      not, comprehend why his brother was so long away from him; and once he
      said, peevishly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had thought I was to be moped up so, I would not have left Mrs.
      Morton. Tom was a bad boy, but still it was somebody to play with. I wish
      I had not gone away with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech cut Philip to the heart. What, then, he had taken from the
      child a respectable and safe shelter&mdash;the sure provision of a life&mdash;and
      the child now reproached him! When this was said to him, the tears gushed
      from his eyes. &ldquo;God forgive me, Sidney,&rdquo; said he, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then Sidney, who had the most endearing ways with him, seeing his
      brother so vexed, ran up and kissed him, and scolded himself for being
      naughty. Still the words were spoken, and their meaning rankled deep.
      Philip himself, too, was morbid in his excessive tenderness for this boy.
      There is a certain age, before the love for the sex commences, when the
      feeling of friendship is almost a passion. You see it constantly in girls
      and boys at school. It is the first vague craving of the heart after the
      master food of human life&mdash;Love. It has its jealousies, and humours,
      and caprices, like love itself. Philip was painfully acute to Sidney&rsquo;s
      affection, was jealous of every particle of it. He dreaded lest his
      brother should ever be torn from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would start from his sleep at night, and go to Sidney&rsquo;s bed to see that
      he was there. He left him in the morning with forebodings&mdash;he
      returned in the dark with fear. Meanwhile the character of this young man,
      so sweet and tender to Sidney, was gradually becoming more hard and stern
      to others. He had now climbed to the post of command in that rude
      establishment; and premature command in any sphere tends to make men
      unsocial and imperious.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Mr. Stubmore called him into his own countinghouse, where stood a
      gentleman, with one hand in his coatpocket, the other tapping his whip
      against his boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philips, show this gentleman the brown mare. She is a beauty in harness,
      is she not? This gentleman wants a match for his pheaton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must step very hoigh,&rdquo; said the gentleman, turning round: and Philip
      recognised the beau in the stage-coach. The recognition was simultaneous.
      The beau nodded, then whistled, and winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my man, I am at your service,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, with many misgivings, followed him across the yard. The gentleman
      then beckoned him to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, sir,&mdash;moind, I never peach&mdash;setting up here in the honest
      line? Dull work, honesty,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I really don&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daun&rsquo;t you recollect old Greggs, the evening you came there with jolly
      Bill Gawtrey? Recollect that, eh?&rdquo; Philip was mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was among the gentlemen in the back parlour who shook you by the hand.
      Bill&rsquo;s off to France, then. I am tauking the provinces. I want a good
      horse&mdash;the best in the yard, moind! Cutting such a swell here! My
      name is Captain de Burgh Smith&mdash;never moind yours, my fine faellow.
      Now, then, out with your rattlers, and keep your tongue in your mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip mechanically ordered out the brown mare, which Captain Smith did
      not seem much to approve of; and, after glancing round the stables with
      great disdain of the collection, he sauntered out of the yard without
      saying more to Philip, though he stopped and spoke a few sentences to Mr.
      Stubmore. Philip hoped he had no design of purchasing, and that he was
      rid, for the present, of so awkward a customer. Mr. Stubmore approached
      Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive over the greys to Sir John,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My lady wants a pair to job.
      A very pleasant man, that Captain Smith. I did not know you had been in a
      yard before&mdash;says you were the pet at Elmore&rsquo;s in London. Served him
      many a day. Pleasant, gentlemanlike man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-e-s!&rdquo; said Philip, hardly knowing what he said, and hurrying back into
      the stables to order out the greys. The place to which he was bound was
      some miles distant, and it was sunset when he returned. As he drove into
      the main street, two men observed him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is he! I am almost sure it is,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Oh! then it&rsquo;s all smooth
      sailing,&rdquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, bless my eyes! you must be mistaken! See whom he&rsquo;s talking to now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Captain de Burgh Smith, mounted on the brown mare, stopped
      Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, I&rsquo;ve bought her,&mdash;hope she&rsquo;ll turn out well. What do
      you really think she&rsquo;s worth? Not to buy, but to sell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sixty guineas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a good day&rsquo;s work; and I owe it to you. The old faellow
      would not have trusted me if you had not served me at Elmore&rsquo;s&mdash;ha!
      ha! If he gets scent and looks shy at you, my lad, come to me. I&rsquo;m at the
      Star Hotel for the next few days. I want a tight faellow like you, and you
      shall have a fair percentage. I&rsquo;m none of your stingy ones. I say, I hope
      this devil is quiet? She cocks up her ears dawmnably!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you, sir!&rdquo; said Philip, very gravely, and rising up in his break; &ldquo;I
      know very little of you, and that little is not much to your credit. I
      give you fair warning that I shall caution my employer against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, my fine faellow? then take care of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, and if you dare utter a word against me,&rdquo; said Philip, with that
      frown to which his swarthy complexion and flashing eyes gave an expression
      of fierce power beyond his years, &ldquo;you will find that, as I am the last to
      care for a threat, so I am the first to resent an injury!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, he drove on. Captain Smith affected a cough, and put his
      brown mare into a canter. The two men followed Philip as he drove into the
      yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know against the person he spoke to?&rdquo; said one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely that he is one of the cunningest swells on this side the Bay,&rdquo;
       returned the other. &ldquo;It looks bad for your young friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first speaker shook his head and made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      On gaining the yard, Philip found that Mr. Stubmore had gone out, and was
      not expected home till the next day. He had some relations who were
      farmers, whom he often visited; to them he was probably gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, therefore, deferring his intended caution against the gay captain
      till the morrow, and musing how the caution might be most discreetly
      given, walked homeward. He had just entered the lane that led to his
      lodgings, when he saw the two men I have spoken of on the other side of
      the street. The taller and better-dressed of the two left his comrade; and
      crossing over to Philip, bowed, and thus accosted him,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine evening, Mr. Philip Morton. I am rejoiced to see you at last. You
      remember me&mdash;Mr. Blackwell, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your business?&rdquo; said Philip, halting, and speaking short and
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be in a passion, my dear sir,&mdash;now don&rsquo;t. I am here on
      behalf of my clients, Messrs. Beaufort, sen. and jun. I have had such work
      to find you! Dear, dear! but you are a sly one! Ha! ha! Well, you see we
      have settled that little affair of Plaskwith&rsquo;s for you (might have been
      ugly), and now I hope you will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your business, sir! What do you want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now, don&rsquo;t be so quick! &lsquo;Tis not the way to do business. Suppose you
      step to my hotel. A glass of wine now, Mr. Philip! We shall soon
      understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of my path, or speak plainly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus put to it, the lawyer, casting a glance at his stout companion, who
      appeared to be contemplating the sunset on the other side of the way, came
      at once to the marrow of his subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&mdash;well, my say is soon said. Mr. Arthur Beaufort takes a
      most lively interest in you; it is he who has directed this inquiry. He
      bids me say that he shall be most happy&mdash;yes, most happy&mdash;to
      serve you in anything; and if you will but see him, he is in the town, I
      am sure you will be charmed with him&mdash;most amiable young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you, sir,&rdquo; said Philip, drawing himself up &ldquo;neither from father, nor
      from son, nor from one of that family, on whose heads rest the mother&rsquo;s
      death and the orphans&rsquo; curse, will I ever accept boon or benefit&mdash;with
      them, voluntarily, I will hold no communion; if they force themselves in
      my path, let them beware! I am earning my bread in the way I desire&mdash;I
      am independent&mdash;I want them not. Begone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, Philip pushed aside the lawyer and strode on rapidly. Mr.
      Blackwell, abashed and perplexed, returned to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip regained his home, and found Sidney stationed at the window alone,
      and with wistful eyes noting the flight of the grey moths as they darted
      to and fro, across the dull shrubs that, variegated with lines for
      washing, adorned the plot of ground which the landlady called a garden.
      The elder brother had returned at an earlier hour than usual, and Sidney
      did not at first perceive him enter. When he did he clapped his hands, and
      ran to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is so good in you, Philip. I have been so dull; you will come and
      play now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart&mdash;where shall we play?&rdquo; said Philip, with a
      cheerful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in the garden!&mdash;it&rsquo;s such a nice time for hide and seek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it not chill and damp for you?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now; you are always making excuses. I see you don&rsquo;t like it. I have
      no heart to play now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidney seated himself and pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Sidney! you must be dull without me. Yes, let us play; but put on
      this handkerchief;&rdquo; and Philip took off his own cravat and tied it round
      his brother&rsquo;s neck, and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidney, whose anger seldom lasted long, was reconciled; and they went into
      the garden to play. It was a little spot, screened by an old moss-grown
      paling, from the neighbouring garden on the one side and a lane on the
      other. They played with great glee till the night grew darker and the dews
      heavier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be the last time,&rdquo; cried Philip. &ldquo;It is my turn to hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! Now, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip secreted himself behind a poplar; and as Sidney searched for him,
      and Philip stole round and round the tree, the latter, happening to look
      across the paling, saw the dim outline of a man&rsquo;s figure in the lane, who
      appeared watching them. A thrill shot across his breast. These Beauforts,
      associated in his thoughts with every evil omen and augury, had they set a
      spy upon his movements? He remained erect and gazing at the form, when
      Sidney discovered, and ran up to him, with his noisy laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the child clung to him, shouting with gladness, Philip, unheeding his
      playmate, called aloud and imperiously to the stranger&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you gaping at? Why do you stand watching us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man muttered something, moved on, and disappeared. &ldquo;I hope there are
      no thieves here! I am so much afraid of thieves,&rdquo; said Sidney,
      tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear grated on Philip&rsquo;s heart. Had he not himself, perhaps, been
      judged and treated as a thief? He said nothing, but drew his brother
      within; and there, in their little room, by the one poor candle, it was
      touching and beautiful to see these boys&mdash;the tender patience of the
      elder lending itself to every whim of the younger&mdash;now building
      houses with cards&mdash;now telling stories of fairy and knight-errant&mdash;the
      sprightliest he could remember or invent. At length, as all was over, and
      Sidney was undressing for the night, Philip, standing apart, said to him,
      in a mournful voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sad now, Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! not when you are with me&mdash;but that is so seldom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you read none of the story-books I bought for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes! but one can&rsquo;t read all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Sidney, if ever we should part, perhaps you will love me no longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; said Sidney. &ldquo;But we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t part, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip sighed, and turned away as his brother leaped into bed. Something
      whispered to him that danger was near; and as it was, could Sidney grow
      up, neglected and uneducated; was it thus that he was to fulfil his trust?

      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;But oh, what storm was in that mind!&rdquo;&mdash;CRABBE. Ruth
</pre>
    <p>
      While Philip mused, and his brother fell into the happy sleep of
      childhood, in a room in the principal hotel of the town sat three persons,
      Arthur Beaufort, Mr. Spencer, and Mr. Blackwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said the first, &ldquo;he rejected every overture from the Beauforts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a scorn I cannot convey to you!&rdquo; replied the lawyer. &ldquo;But the fact
      is, that he is evidently a lad of low habits; to think of his being a sort
      of helper to a horse dealer! I suppose, sir, he was always in the stables
      in his father&rsquo;s time. Bad company depraves the taste very soon; but that
      is not the worst. Sharp declares that the man he was talking with, as I
      told you, is a common swindler. Depend on it, Mr. Arthur, he is
      incorrigible; all we can do is to save the brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too dreadful to contemplate!&rdquo; said Arthur, who, still ill and
      languid, reclined on a sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer; &ldquo;I am sure I should not know what to do
      with such a character; but the other poor child, it would be a mercy to
      get hold of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Sharp?&rdquo; asked Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;he has followed Philip at a distance to find out
      his lodgings, and learn if his brother is with him. Oh! here he is!&rdquo; and
      Blackwell&rsquo;s companion in the earlier part of the evening entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found him out, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, wiping his forehead. &ldquo;What a
      fierce &lsquo;un he is! I thought he would have had a stone at my head; but we
      officers are used to it; we does our duty, and Providence makes our heads
      unkimmon hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the child with him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, quiet, subdued boy?&rdquo; asked the melancholy inhabitant of the
      Lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet! Lord love you! never heard a noisier little urchin! There they
      were, romping and romping in the garden, like a couple of gaol birds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; groaned Mr. Spencer, &ldquo;he will make that poor child as bad as
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall us do, Mr. Blackwell?&rdquo; asked Sharp, who longed for his brandy
      and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I was thinking you might go to the horse-dealer the first thing in
      the morning; find out whether Philip is really thick with the swindler;
      and, perhaps, Mr. Stubmore may have some influence with him, if, without
      saying who he is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Arthur, &ldquo;do not expose his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could still hint that he ought to be induced to listen to his friends
      and go with them. Mr. Stubmore may be a respectable man, and&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Sharp; &ldquo;I have no doubt as how I can settle it. We
      learns to know human natur in our profession;&mdash;&lsquo;cause why? we gets at
      its blind side. Good night, gentlemen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem very pale, Mr. Arthur; you had better go to bed; you promised
      your father, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am not well; I will go to bed;&rdquo; and Arthur rose, lighted his
      candle, and sought his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see Philip to-morrow,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;he will listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conduct of Arthur Beaufort in executing the charge he had undertaken
      had brought into full light all the most amiable and generous part of his
      character. As soon as he was sufficiently recovered, he had expressed so
      much anxiety as to the fate of the orphans, that to quiet him his father
      was forced to send for Mr. Blackwell. The lawyer had ascertained, through
      Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, the name of Philip&rsquo;s employer at R&mdash;&mdash;. At
      Arthur&rsquo;s request he went down to Mr. Plaskwith; and arriving there the day
      after the return of the bookseller, learned those particulars with which
      Mr. Plaskwith&rsquo;s letter to Roger Morton has already made the reader
      acquainted. The lawyer then sent for Mr. Sharp, the officer before
      employed, and commissioned him to track the young man&rsquo;s whereabout. That
      shrewd functionary soon reported that a youth every way answering to
      Philip&rsquo;s description had been introduced the night of the escape by a man
      celebrated, not indeed for robberies, or larcenies, or crimes of the
      coarser kind, but for address in all that more large and complex character
      which comes under the denomination of living upon one&rsquo;s wits, to a polite
      rendezvous frequented by persons of a similar profession. Since then,
      however, all clue of Philip was lost. But though Mr. Blackwell, in the way
      of his profession, was thus publicly benevolent towards the fugitive, he
      did not the less privately represent to his patrons, senior and junior,
      the very equivocal character that Philip must be allowed to bear. Like
      most lawyers, hard upon all who wander from the formal tracks, he
      unaffectedly regarded Philip&rsquo;s flight and absence as proofs of a reprobate
      disposition; and this conduct was greatly aggravated in his eyes by Mr.
      Sharp&rsquo;s report, by which it appeared that after his escape Philip had so
      suddenly, and, as it were, so naturally, taken to such equivocal
      companionship. Mr. Robert Beaufort, already prejudiced against Philip,
      viewed matters in the same light as the lawyer; and the story of his
      supposed predilections reached Arthur&rsquo;s ears in so distorted a shape, that
      even he was staggered and revolted:&mdash;still Philip was so young&mdash;Arthur&rsquo;s
      oath to the orphans&rsquo; mother so recent&mdash;and if thus early inclined to
      wrong courses, should not every effort be made to lure him back to the
      straight path? With these views and reasonings, as soon as he was able,
      Arthur himself visited Mrs. Lacy, and the note from Philip, which the good
      lady put into his hands, affected him deeply, and confirmed all his
      previous resolutions. Mrs. Lacy was very anxious to get at his name; but
      Arthur, having heard that Philip had refused all aid from his father and
      Mr. Blackwell, thought that the young man&rsquo;s pride might work equally
      against himself, and therefore evaded the landlady&rsquo;s curiosity. He wrote
      the next day the letter we have seen, to Mr. Roger Morton, whose address
      Catherine had given to him; and by return of post came a letter from the
      linendraper narrating the flight of Sidney, as it was supposed with his
      brother. This news so excited Arthur that he insisted on going down to N&mdash;&mdash;
      at once, and joining in the search. His father, alarmed for his health,
      positively refused; and the consequence was an increase of fever, a
      consultation with the doctors, and a declaration that Mr. Arthur was in
      that state that it would be dangerous not to let him have his own way, Mr.
      Beaufort was forced to yield, and with Blackwell and Mr. Sharp accompanied
      his son to N&mdash;&mdash;. The inquiries, hitherto fruitless, then
      assumed a more regular and business-like character. By little and little
      they came, through the aid of Mr. Sharp, upon the right clue, up to a
      certain point. But here there was a double scent: two youths answering the
      description, had been seen at a small village; then there came those who
      asserted that they had seen the same youths at a seaport in one direction;
      others, who deposed to their having taken the road to an inland town in
      the other. This had induced Arthur and his father to part company. Mr.
      Beaufort, accompanied by Roger Morton, went to the seaport; and Arthur,
      with Mr. Spencer and Mr. Sharp, more fortunate, tracked the fugitives to
      their retreat. As for Mr. Beaufort, senior, now that his mind was more at
      ease about his son, he was thoroughly sick of the whole thing; greatly
      bored by the society of Mr. Morton; very much ashamed that he, so
      respectable and great a man, should be employed on such an errand; more
      afraid of, than pleased with, any chance of discovering the fierce Philip;
      and secretly resolved upon slinking back to London at the first reasonable
      excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Mr. Sharp entered betimes Mr. Stubmore&rsquo;s counting-house.
      In the yard he caught a glimpse of Philip, and managed to keep himself
      unseen by that young gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stubmore, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharp shut the glass door mysteriously, and lifting up the corner of a
      green curtain that covered the panes, beckoned to the startled Stubmore to
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that &lsquo;ere young man in the velveteen jacket? you employs him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, sir; he&rsquo;s my right hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, don&rsquo;t be frightened, but his friends are arter him. He has got
      into bad ways, and we want you to give him a little good advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! I know he has run away, like a fine-spirited lad as he is; and as
      long as he likes to stay with me, they as comes after him may get a
      ducking in the horse-trough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be you a father? a father of a family, Mr. Stubmore?&rdquo; said Sharp,
      thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets, swelling out his stomach,
      and pursing up his lips with great solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! no gammon with me! Take your chaff to the goslings. I tells you
      I can&rsquo;t do without that &lsquo;ere lad. Every man to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; thought Sharp, &ldquo;I must change the tack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Stubmore,&rdquo; said he, taking a stool, &ldquo;you speaks like a sensible man.
      No one can reasonably go for to ask a gentleman to go for to inconvenience
      hisself. But what do you know of that &lsquo;ere youngster. Had you a carakter
      with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s more to yourself, Mr. Stubmore; he is but a lad, and if he goes
      back to his friends they may take care of him, but he got into a bad set
      afore he come here. Do you know a good-looking chap with whiskers, who
      talks of his pheaton, and was riding last night on a brown mare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s!&rdquo; said Mr. Stubmore, growing rather pale, &ldquo;and I knows
      the mare, too. Why, sir, I sold him that mare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he pay you for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to be sure, he gave me a cheque on Coutts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you took it! My eyes! what a flat!&rdquo; Here Mr. Sharp closed the orbs he
      had invoked, and whistled with that self-hugging delight which men
      invariably feel when another man is taken in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stubmore became evidently nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what now;&mdash;you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m done? I did not let him have the
      mare till I went to the hotel,&mdash;found he was cutting a great dash
      there, a groom, a pheaton, and a fine horse, and as extravagant as the
      devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord!&mdash;O Lord! what a world this is! What does he call his-self?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s the cheque&mdash;George Frederick de&mdash;de Burgh Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put it in your pipe, my man,&mdash;put it in your pipe&mdash;not worth a
      d&mdash;-!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who the deuce are you, sir?&rdquo; bawled out Mr. Stubmore, in an equal
      rage both with himself and his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, sir,&rdquo; said the visitor, rising with great dignity,&mdash;&ldquo;I, sir, am
      of the great Bow Street Office, and my name is John Sharp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stubmore nearly fell off his stool, his eyes rolled in his head, and
      his teeth chattered. Mr. Sharp perceived the advantage he had gained, and
      continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; and I could have much to say against that chap, who is nothing
      more or less than Dashing Jerry, as has ruined more girls and more
      tradesmen than any lord in the land. And so I called to give you a bit of
      caution; for, says I to myself, &lsquo;Mr. Stubmore is a respectable man.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am, sir,&rdquo; said the crestfallen horse-dealer; &ldquo;that was always my
      character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the father of a family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three boys and a babe at the buzzom,&rdquo; said Mr. Stubmore pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be taken in if I can help it! That &lsquo;ere young man as I am
      arter, you see, knows Captain Smith&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;smell a rat now&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Smith said he knew him&mdash;the wiper&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what made
      me so green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must not be hard on the youngster: &lsquo;cause why? he has friends as
      is gemmen. But you tell him to go back to his poor dear relations, and all
      shall be forgiven; and say as how you won&rsquo;t keep him; and if he don&rsquo;t go
      back, he&rsquo;ll have to get his livelihood without a carakter; and use your
      influence with him like a man and a Christian, and what&rsquo;s more, like the
      father of a family&mdash;Mr. Stubmore&mdash;with three boys and a babe at
      the buzzom. You won&rsquo;t keep him now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep him! I have had a precious escape. I&rsquo;d better go and see after the
      mare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if you&rsquo;ll find her: the Captain caught a sight of me this
      morning. Why, he lodges at our hotel. He&rsquo;s off by this time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why the devil did you let him go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause I had no writ agin him!&rdquo; said the Bow Street officer; and he
      walked straight out of the counting-office, satisfied that he had &ldquo;done
      the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To snatch his hat&mdash;to run to the hotel&mdash;to find that Captain
      Smith had indeed gone off in his phaeton, bag and baggage, the same as he
      came, except that he had now two horses to the phaeton instead of one&mdash;having
      left with the landlord the amount of his bill in another cheque upon
      Coutts&mdash;was the work of five minutes with Mr. Stubmore. He returned
      home, panting and purple with indignation and wounded feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that chap, whom I took into my yard like a son, should have
      connived at this! &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the money&mdash;&lsquo;tis the willany that &lsquo;flicts
      me!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Stubmore, as he re-entered the mews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he came plump upon Philip, who said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I wished to see you, to say that you had better take care of Captain
      Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you did, did you, now he&rsquo;s gone? &lsquo;sconded off to America, I dare say,
      by this time. Now look ye, young man; your friends are after you, I won&rsquo;t
      say anything agin you; but you go back to them&mdash;I wash my hands of
      you. Quite too much for me. There&rsquo;s your week, and never let me catch you
      in my yard agin, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip dropped the money which Stubmore had put into his hand. &ldquo;My
      friends!&mdash;friends have been with you, have they? I thought so&mdash;I
      thank them. And so you part with me? Well, you have been very kind, very
      kind; let us part kindly;&rdquo; and he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stubmore was softened&mdash;he touched the hand held out to him, and
      looked doubtful a moment; but Captain de Burgh Smith&rsquo;s cheque for eighty
      guineas suddenly rose before his eyes. He turned on his heel abruptly, and
      said, over his shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go after Captain Smith (he&rsquo;ll come to the gallows); mend your ways,
      and be ruled by your poor dear relatives, whose hearts you are breaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Smith! Did my relations tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;they told me all&mdash;that is, they sent to tell me;
      so you see I&rsquo;m d&mdash;-d soft not to lay hold of you. But, perhaps, if
      they be gemmen, they&rsquo;ll act as sich, and cash me this here cheque!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the last words were said to air. Philip had rushed from the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a heaving breast, and every nerve in his body quivering with wrath,
      the proud, unhappy boy strode through the gay streets. They had betrayed
      him then, these accursed Beauforts! they circled his steps with schemes to
      drive him like a deer into the snare of their loathsome charity! The roof
      was to be taken from his head&mdash;the bread from his lips&mdash;so that
      he might fawn at their knees for bounty. &ldquo;But they shall not break my
      spirit, nor steal away my curse. No, my dead mother, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he thus muttered, he passed through a patch of waste land that led to
      the row of houses in which his lodging was placed. And here a voice called
      to him, and a hand was laid on his shoulder. He turned, and Arthur
      Beaufort, who had followed him from the street, stood behind him. Philip
      did not, at the first glance, recognise his cousin; illness had so altered
      him, and his dress was so different from that in which he had first and
      last beheld him. The contrast between the two young men was remarkable.
      Philip was clad in a rough garb suited to his late calling&mdash;a jacket
      of black velveteen, ill-fitting and ill-fashioned, loose fustian trousers,
      coarse shoes, his hat set deep over his pent eyebrows, his raven hair long
      and neglected. He was just at that age when one with strong features and
      robust frame is at the worst in point of appearance&mdash;the sinewy
      proportions not yet sufficiently fleshed, and seeming inharmonious and
      undeveloped; precisely in proportion, perhaps, to the symmetry towards
      which they insensibly mature: the contour of the face sharpened from the
      roundness of boyhood, and losing its bloom without yet acquiring that
      relief and shadow which make the expression and dignity of the masculine
      countenance. Thus accoutred, thus gaunt, and uncouth, stood Morton. Arthur
      Beaufort, always refined in his appearance, seemed yet more so from the
      almost feminine delicacy which ill-health threw over his pale complexion
      and graceful figure; that sort of unconscious elegance which belongs to
      the dress of the rich when they are young&mdash;seen most in minutiae&mdash;not
      observable, perhaps, by themselves-marked forcibly and painfully the
      distinction of rank between the two. That distinction Beaufort did not
      feel; but at a glance it was visible to Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The past rushed back on him. The sunny lawn&mdash;the gun offered and
      rejected&mdash;the pride of old, much less haughty than the pride of
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; said Beaufort, feebly, &ldquo;they tell me you will not accept any
      kindness from me or mine. Ah! if you knew how we have sought you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew!&rdquo; cried Philip, savagely, for that unlucky sentence recalled to him
      his late interview with his employer, and his present destitution. &ldquo;Knew!
      And why have you dared to hunt me out, and halloo me down?&mdash;why must
      this insolent tyranny, that assumes the right over these limbs and this
      free will, betray and expose me and my wretchedness wherever I turn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your poor mother&mdash;&rdquo; began Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name her not with your lips&mdash;name her not!&rdquo; cried Philip, growing
      livid with his emotions. &ldquo;Talk not of the mercy&mdash;the forethought&mdash;a
      Beaufort could show to her and her offspring! I accept it not&mdash;I
      believe it not. Oh, yes! you follow me now with your false kindness; and
      why? Because your father&mdash;your vain, hollow, heartless father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said Beaufort, in a tone of such reproach, that it startled the
      wild heart on which it fell; &ldquo;it is my father you speak of. Let the son
      respect the son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no! I will respect none of your race. I tell you your
      father fears me. I tell you that my last words to him ring in his ears! My
      wrongs! Arthur Beaufort, when you are absent I seek to forget them; in
      your abhorred presence they revive&mdash;they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, almost choked with his passion; but continued instantly, with
      equal intensity of fervour:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were yon tree the gibbet, and to touch your hand could alone save me from
      it, I would scorn your aid. Aid! The very thought fires my blood and
      nerves my hand. Aid! Will a Beaufort give me back my birthright&mdash;restore
      my dead mother&rsquo;s fair name? Minion!&mdash;sleek, dainty, luxurious minion!&mdash;out
      of my path! You have my fortune, my station, my rights; I have but
      poverty, and hate, and disdain. I swear, again and again, that you shall
      not purchase these from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Philip&mdash;Philip,&rdquo; cried Beaufort, catching his arm; &ldquo;hear one&mdash;hear
      one who stood by your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence that would have saved the outcast from the demons that were
      darkening and swooping round his soul, died upon the young Protector&rsquo;s
      lips. Blinded, maddened, excited, and exasperated, almost out of humanity
      itself, Philip fiercely&mdash;brutally&mdash;swung aside the enfeebled
      form that sought to cling to him, and Beaufort fell at his feet. Morton
      stopped&mdash;glared at him with clenched hands and a smiling lip, sprung
      over his prostrate form, and bounded to his home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slackened his pace as he neared the house, and looked behind; but
      Beaufort had not followed him. He entered the house, and found Sidney in
      the room, with a countenance so much more gay than that he had lately
      worn, that, absorbed as he was in thought and passion, it yet did not fail
      to strike him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has pleased you, Sidney?&rdquo; The child smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is a secret&mdash;I was not to tell you. But I&rsquo;m sure you are not
      the naughty boy he says you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&mdash;who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so angry, Philip: you frighten me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you torture me. Who could malign one brother to the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it was all meant very kindly&mdash;there&rsquo;s been such a nice, dear,
      good gentleman here, and he cried when he saw me, and said he knew dear
      mamma. Well, and he has promised to take me home with him and give me a
      pretty pony&mdash;as pretty&mdash;as pretty&mdash;oh, as pretty as it can
      be got! And he is to call again and tell me more: I think he is a fairy,
      Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that he was to take me, too, Sidney?&rdquo; said Morton, seating
      himself, and looking very pale. At that question Sidney hung his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, brother&mdash;he says you won&rsquo;t go, and that you are a bad boy&mdash;and
      that you associate with wicked people&mdash;and that you want to keep me
      shut up here and not let any one be good to me. But I told him I did not
      believe that&mdash;yes, indeed, I told him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Sidney endeavoured caressingly to withdraw the hands that his brother
      placed before his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton started up, and walked hastily to and fro the room. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; thought
      he, &ldquo;is another emissary of the Beauforts&rsquo;&mdash;perhaps the lawyer: they
      will take him from me&mdash;the last thing left to love and hope for. I
      will foil them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;we must go hence today, this very hour&mdash;nay,
      instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! away from this nice, good gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse him! yes, away from him. Do not cry&mdash;it is of no use&mdash;you
      must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said more harshly than Philip had ever yet spoken to Sidney; and
      when he had said it, he left the room to settle with the landlady, and to
      pack up their scanty effects. In another hour, the brothers had turned
      their backs on the town.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry thee
        In sorrow&rsquo;s arms to welcome Misery.&rdquo;
 
               HEYWOOD&rsquo;s Duchess of Sufolk.

        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s here besides foul weather?&rdquo;
                    SHAKSPEARE Lear.
</pre>
    <p>
      The sun was as bright and the sky as calm during the journey of the
      orphans as in the last. They avoided, as before, the main roads, and their
      way lay through landscapes that might have charmed a Gainsborough&rsquo;s eye.
      Autumn scattered its last hues of gold over the various foliage, and the
      poppy glowed from the hedges, and the wild convolvuli, here and there,
      still gleamed on the wayside with a parting smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, over the sloping stubbles, broke the sound of the sportsman&rsquo;s
      gun; and ever and anon, by stream and sedge, they startled the shy wild
      fowl, just come from the far lands, nor yet settled in the new haunts too
      soon to be invaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no longer in the travellers the same hearts that had made
      light of hardship and fatigue. Sidney was no longer flying from a harsh
      master, and his step was not elastic with the energy of fear that looked
      behind, and of hope that smiled before. He was going a toilsome, weary
      journey, he knew not why nor whither; just, too, when he had made a
      friend, whose soothing words haunted his childish fancy. He was displeased
      with Philip, and in sullen and silent thoughtfulness slowly plodded behind
      him; and Morton himself was gloomy, and knew not where in the world to
      seek a future.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at dusk at a small inn, not so far distant from the town they
      had left as Morton could have wished; but the days were shorter than in
      their first flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were shown into a small sanded parlour, which Sidney eyed with great
      disgust; nor did he seem more pleased with the hacked and jagged leg of
      cold mutton, which was all that the hostess set before them for supper.
      Philip in vain endeavoured to cheer him up, and ate to set him the
      example. He felt relieved when, under the auspices of a good-looking,
      good-natured chambermaid, Sidney retired to rest, and he was left in the
      parlour to his own meditations. Hitherto it had been a happy thing for
      Morton that he had had some one dependent on him; that feeling had given
      him perseverance, patience, fortitude, and hope. But now, dispirited and
      sad, he felt rather the horror of being responsible for a human life,
      without seeing the means to discharge the trust. It was clear, even to his
      experience, that he was not likely to find another employer as facile as
      Mr. Stubmore; and wherever he went, he felt as if his Destiny stalked at
      his back. He took out his little fortune and spread it on the table,
      counting it over and over; it had remained pretty stationary since his
      service with Mr. Stubmore, for Sidney had swallowed up the wages of his
      hire. While thus employed, the door opened, and the chambermaid, showing
      in a gentleman, said, &ldquo;We have no other room, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&mdash;I&rsquo;m not particular; a tumbler of braundy and
      water, stiffish, cold without, the newspaper&mdash;and a cigar. You&rsquo;ll
      excuse smoking, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked up from his hoard, and Captain de Burgh Smith stood before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;well met!&rdquo; And closing the door, he took off his
      great-coat, seated himself near Philip, and bent both his eyes with
      considerable wistfulness on the neat rows into which Philip&rsquo;s bank-notes,
      sovereigns, and shillings were arrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty little sum for pocket money; caush in hand goes a great way,
      properly invested. You must have been very lucky. Well, so I suppose you
      are surprised to see me here without my pheaton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had never seen you at all,&rdquo; replied Philip, uncourteously, and
      restoring his money to his pocket; &ldquo;your fraud upon Mr. Stubmore, and your
      assurance that you knew me, have sent me adrift upon the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s one man&rsquo;s meat is another man&rsquo;s poison,&rdquo; said the captain,
      philosophically; &ldquo;no use fretting, care killed a cat. I am as badly off as
      you; for, hang me, if there was not a Bow Street runner in the town. I
      caught his eye fixed on me like a gimlet: so I bolted&mdash;went to N&mdash;&mdash;,
      left my pheaton and groom there for the present, and have doubled back, to
      bauffle pursuit, and cut across the country. You recollect that noice girl
      we saw in the coach; &lsquo;gad, I served her spouse that is to be a praetty
      trick! Borrowed his money under pretence of investing it in the New Grand
      Anti-Dry-Rot Company; cool hundred&mdash;it&rsquo;s only just gone, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the chambermaid entered with the brandy and water, the newspaper, and
      cigar,&mdash;the captain lighted the last, took a deep sup from the
      beverage, and said, gaily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, let us join fortunes; we are both, as you say, &lsquo;adrift.&rsquo; Best
      way to staund the breeze is to unite the caubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip shook his head, and, displeased with his companion, sought his
      pillow. He took care to put his money under his head, and to lock his
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers started at daybreak; Sidney was even more discontented than
      on the previous day. The weather was hot and oppressive; they rested for
      some hours at noon, and in the cool of the evening renewed their way.
      Philip had made up his mind to steer for a town in the thick of a hunting
      district, where he hoped his equestrian capacities might again befriend
      him; and their path now lay through a chain of vast dreary commons, which
      gave them at least the advantage to skirt the road-side unobserved. But,
      somehow or other, either Philip had been misinformed as to an inn where he
      had proposed to pass the night, or he had missed it; for the clouds
      darkened, and the sun went down, and no vestige of human habitation was
      discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidney, footsore and querulous, began to weep, and declare that he could
      stir no further; and while Philip, whose iron frame defied fatigue,
      compassionately paused to rest his brother, a low roll of thunder broke upon
      the gloomy air. &ldquo;There will be a storm,&rdquo; said he, anxiously. &ldquo;Come on&mdash;pray,
      Sidney, come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so cruel in you, brother Philip,&rdquo; replied Sidney, sobbing. &ldquo;I wish
      I had never&mdash;never gone with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flash of lightning, that illuminated the whole heavens, lingered round
      Sidney&rsquo;s pale face as he spoke; and Philip threw himself instinctively on
      the child, as if to protect him even from the wrath of the unshelterable
      flame. Sidney, hushed and terrified, clung to his brother&rsquo;s breast; after
      a pause, he silently consented to resume their journey. But now the storm
      came nearer and nearer to the wanderers. The darkness grew rapidly more
      intense, save when the lightning lit up heaven and earth alike with
      intolerable lustre. And when at length the rain began to fall in merciless
      and drenching torrents, even Philip&rsquo;s brave heart failed him. How could he
      ask Sidney to proceed, when they could scarcely see an inch before them?&mdash;all
      that could now be done was to gain the high-road, and hope for some
      passing conveyance. With fits and starts, and by the glare of the
      lightning, they obtained their object; and stood at last on the great
      broad thoroughfare, along which, since the day when the Roman carved it
      from the waste, Misery hath plodded, and Luxury rolled, their common way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had stripped handkerchief, coat, vest, all to shelter Sidney; and
      he felt a kind of strange pleasure through the dark, even to hear Sidney&rsquo;s
      voice wail and moan. But that voice grew more languid and faint&mdash;it
      ceased&mdash;Sidney&rsquo;s weight hung heavy&mdash;heavier on the fostering
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, speak!&mdash;speak, Sidney!&mdash;only one word&mdash;I
      will carry you in my arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am dying,&rdquo; replied Sidney, in a low murmur; &ldquo;I am so tired and
      worn out I can go no further&mdash;I must lie here.&rdquo; And he sank at once
      upon the reeking grass beside the road. At this time the rain gradually
      relaxed, the clouds broke away&mdash;a grey light succeeded to the
      darkness&mdash;the lightning was more distant; and the thunder rolled
      onward in its awful path. Kneeling on the ground, Philip supported his
      brother in his arms, and cast his pleading eyes upward to the softening
      terrors of the sky. A star, a solitary star&mdash;broke out for one
      moment, as if to smile comfort upon him, and then vanished. But lo! in the
      distance there suddenly gleamed a red, steady light, like that in some
      solitary window; it was no will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, it was too stationary&mdash;human
      shelter was then nearer than he had thought for. He pointed to the light,
      and whispered, &ldquo;Rouse yourself, one struggle more&mdash;it cannot be far
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible&mdash;I cannot stir,&rdquo; answered Sidney: and a sudden
      flash of lightning showed his countenance, ghastly, as if with the damps
      of Death. What could the brother do?&mdash;stay there, and see the boy
      perish before his eyes? leave him on the road and fly to the friendly
      light? The last plan was the sole one left, yet he shrank from it in
      greater terror than the first. Was that a step that he heard across the
      road? He held his breath to listen&mdash;a form became dimly visible&mdash;it
      approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip shouted aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; answered the voice, and it seemed familiar to Morton&rsquo;s ear. He
      sprang forward; and putting his face close to the wayfarer, thought to
      recognise the features of Captain de Burgh Smith. The Captain, whose eyes
      were yet more accustomed to the dark, made the first overture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my lad, is it you then? &lsquo;Gad, you froightened me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Odious as this man had hitherto been to Philip, he was as welcome to him
      as daylight now; he grasped his hand,&mdash;&ldquo;My brother&mdash;a child&mdash;is
      here, dying, I fear, with cold and fatigue; he cannot stir. Will you stay
      with him&mdash;support him&mdash;but for a few moments, while I make to
      yon light? See, I have money&mdash;plenty of money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My good lad, it is very ugly work staying here at this hour: still&mdash;where&rsquo;s
      the choild?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, here! make haste, raise him! that&rsquo;s right! God bless you! I shall
      be back ere you think me gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang from the road, and plunged through the heath, the furze, the
      rank glistening pools, straight towards the light&mdash;as the swimmer
      towards the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, though a rogue, was human; and when life&mdash;an innocent
      life&mdash;is at stake, even a rogue&rsquo;s heart rises up from its weedy bed.
      He muttered a few oaths, it is true, but he held the child in his arms;
      and, taking out a little tin case, poured some brandy down Sidney&rsquo;s throat
      and then, by way of company, down his own. The cordial revived the boy; he
      opened his eyes, and said, &ldquo;I think I can go on now, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ........
</pre>
    <p>
      We must return to Arthur Beaufort. He was naturally, though gentle, a
      person of high spirit and not without pride. He rose from the ground with
      bitter, resentful feelings and a blushing cheek, and went his way to the
      hotel. Here he found Mr. Spencer just returned from his visit to Sidney.
      Enchanted with the soft and endearing manners of his lost Catherine&rsquo;s son,
      and deeply affected with the resemblance the child bore to the mother as
      he had seen her last at the gay and rosy age of fair sixteen, his
      description of the younger brother drew Beaufort&rsquo;s indignant thoughts from
      the elder. He cordially concurred with Mr. Spencer in the wish to save one
      so gentle from the domination of one so fierce; and this, after all, was
      the child Catherine had most strongly commended to him. She had said
      little of the elder; perhaps she had been aware of his ungracious and
      untractable nature, and, as it seemed to Arthur Beaufort, his
      predilections for a coarse and low career.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this boy, then, shall console me for the perverse
      brutality of the other. He shall indeed drink of my cup, and eat of my
      bread, and be to me as a brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, changing countenance, &ldquo;you do not intend to take
      Sidney to live with you. I meant him for my son&mdash;my adopted son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; generous as you are,&rdquo; said Arthur, pressing his hand, &ldquo;this charge
      devolves on me&mdash;it is my right. I am the orphan&rsquo;s relation&mdash;his
      mother consigned him to me. But he shall be taught to love you not the
      less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spencer was silent. He could not bear the thought of losing Sidney as
      an inmate of his cheerless home, a tender relic of his early love. From
      that moment he began to contemplate the possibility of securing Sidney to
      himself, unknown to Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plans both of Arthur and Spencer were interrupted by the sudden
      retreat of the brothers. They determined to depart different ways in
      search of them. Spencer, as the more helpless of the two, obtained the aid
      of Mr. Sharp; Beaufort departed with the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two travellers, in a hired barouche, were slowly dragged by a pair of
      jaded posters along the commons I have just described.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;that the storm is very much abated; heigho! what an
      unpleasant night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unkimmon ugly, sir,&rdquo; answered the other; &ldquo;and an awful long stage,
      eighteen miles. These here remote places are quite behind the age, sir&mdash;quite.
      However, I think we shall kitch them now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much afraid of that eldest boy, Sharp. He seems a dreadful
      vagabond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, sir, quite hand in glove with Dashing Jerry; met in the same inn
      last night&mdash;preconcerted, you may be quite shure. It would be the
      best day&rsquo;s job I have done this many a day to save that &lsquo;ere little fellow
      from being corrupted. You sees he is just of a size to be useful to these
      bad karakters. If they took to burglary, he would be a treasure to them&mdash;slip
      him through a pane of glass like a ferret, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it, Sharp,&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, with a groan; &ldquo;and recollect,
      if we get hold of him, that you are not to say a word to Mr. Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, sir; and I always goes with the gemman who behaves most
      like a gemman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a loud halloo was heard close by the horses&rsquo; heads. &ldquo;Good Heavens, if
      that is a footpad!&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, shaking violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, sir, I have my barkers with me. Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; The barouche stopped&mdash;a
      man came to the window. &ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;but there is
      a poor boy here so tired and ill that I fear he will never reach the next
      town, unless you will koindly give him a lift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor boy!&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, poking his head over the head of Mr.
      Sharp. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would just drop him at the King&rsquo;s Awrms it would be a chaurity,&rdquo;
       said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sharp pinched Mr. Spencer in his shoulder. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Dashing Jerry; I&rsquo;ll get
      out.&rdquo; So saying, he opened the door, jumped into the road, and presently
      reappeared with the lost and welcome Sidney in his arms. &ldquo;Ben&rsquo;t this the
      boy?&rdquo; he whispered to Mr. Spencer; and, taking the lamp from the carriage,
      he raised it to the child&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is! it is! God be thanked!&rdquo; exclaimed the worthy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you leave him at the King&rsquo;s Awrms?&mdash;we shall be there in an
      hour or two,&rdquo; cried the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We! Who&rsquo;s we?&rdquo; said Sharp, gruffly. &ldquo;Why, myself and the choild&rsquo;s
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Sharp, raising the lantern to his own face; &ldquo;you knows me, I
      think, Master Jerry? Let me kitch you again, that&rsquo;s all. And give my
      compliments to your &lsquo;sociate, and say, if he prosecutes this here hurchin
      any more, we&rsquo;ll settle his bizness for him; and so take a hint and make
      yourself scarce, old boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that Mr. Sharp jumped into the barouche, and bade the postboy drive
      on as fast as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes after this abduction, Philip, followed by two labourers, with
      a barrow, a lantern, and two blankets, returned from the hospitable farm
      to which the light had conducted him. The spot where he had left Sidney,
      and which he knew by a neighbouring milestone, was vacant; he shouted an
      alarm, and the Captain answered from the distance of some threescore
      yards. Philip came to him. &ldquo;Where is my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone away in a barouche and pair. Devil take me if I understand it.&rdquo; And
      the Captain proceeded to give a confused account of what had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother! my brother! they have torn thee from me, then;&rdquo; cried Philip,
      and he fell to the earth insensible.

     &ldquo;Vous me rendrez mon frere!&rdquo;
         CASIMER DELAVIGNE: Les Enfans d&rsquo;Edouard.

     [You shall restore me my brother!]
</pre>
    <p>
      One evening, a week after this event, a wild, tattered, haggard youth
      knocked at the door of Mr. Robert Beaufort. The porter slowly presented
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your master at home? I must see him instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than you can, my man; my master does not see the like of you
      at this time of night,&rdquo; replied the porter, eying the ragged apparition
      before him with great disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See me he must and shall,&rdquo; replied the young man; and as the porter
      blocked up the entrance, he grasped his collar with a hand of iron, swung
      him, huge as he was, aside, and strode into the spacious hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; cried the porter, recovering himself. &ldquo;James! John! here&rsquo;s a
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Beaufort had been back in town several days. Mrs. Beaufort, who
      was waiting his return from his club, was in the dining-room. Hearing a
      noise in the hall, she opened the door, and saw the strange grim figure I
      have described, advancing towards her. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and what
      do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Philip Morton. Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband,&rdquo; said Mrs. Beaufort, shrinking into the parlour, while Morton
      followed her and closed the door, &ldquo;my husband, Mr. Beaufort, is not at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Mrs. Beaufort, then! Well, you can understand me. I want my
      brother. He has been basely reft from me. Tell me where he is, and I will
      forgive all. Restore him to me, and I will bless you and yours.&rdquo; And
      Philip fell on his knees and grasped the train of her gown. &ldquo;I know
      nothing of your brother, Mr. Morton,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Beaufort, surprised and
      alarmed. &ldquo;Arthur, whom we expect every day, writes us word that all search
      for him has been in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! you admit the search?&rdquo; cried Morton, rising and clenching his hands.
      &ldquo;And who else but you or yours would have parted brother and brother?
      Answer me where he is. No subterfuge, madam: I am desperate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaufort, though a woman of that worldly coldness and indifference
      which, on ordinary occasions, supply the place of courage, was extremely
      terrified by the tone and mien of her rude guest. She laid her hand on the
      bell; but Morton seized her arm, and, holding it sternly, said, while his
      dark eyes shot fire through the glimmering room, &ldquo;I will not stir hence
      till you have told me. Will you reject my gratitude, my blessing? Beware!
      Again, where have you hid my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the door opened, and Mr. Robert Beaufort entered. The
      lady, with a shriek of joy, wrenched herself from Philip&rsquo;s grasp, and flew
      to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me from this ruffian!&rdquo; she said, with an hysterical sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort, who had heard from Blackwell strange accounts of Philip&rsquo;s
      obdurate perverseness, vile associates, and unredeemable character, was
      roused from his usual timidity by the appeal of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insolent reprobate!&rdquo; he said, advancing to Philip; &ldquo;after all the absurd
      goodness of my son and myself; after rejecting all our offers, and
      persisting in your miserable and vicious conduct, how dare you presume to
      force yourself into this house? Begone, or I will send for the constables
      to remove YOU!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, man,&rdquo; cried Philip, restraining the fury that shook him from head to
      foot, &ldquo;I care not for your threats&mdash;I scarcely hear your abuse&mdash;your
      son, or yourself, has stolen away my brother: tell me only where he is;
      let me see him once more. Do not drive me hence, without one word of
      justice, of pity. I implore you&mdash;on my knees I implore you&mdash;yes,
      I,&mdash;I implore you, Robert Beaufort, to have mercy on your brother&rsquo;s
      son. Where is Sidney?&rdquo; Like all mean and cowardly men, Robert Beaufort was
      rather encouraged than softened by Philip&rsquo;s abrupt humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of your brother; and if this is not all some villainous
      trick&mdash;which it may be&mdash;I am heartily rejoiced that he, poor
      child! is rescued from the contamination of such a companion,&rdquo; answered
      Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am at your feet still; again, for the last time, clinging to you a
      suppliant: I pray you to tell me the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort, more and more exasperated by Morton&rsquo;s forbearance, raised
      his hand as if to strike; when, at that moment, one hitherto unobserved&mdash;one
      who, terrified by the scene she had witnessed but could not comprehend,
      had slunk into a dark corner of the room,&mdash;now came from her retreat.
      And a child&rsquo;s soft voice was heard, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not strike him, papa!&mdash;let him have his brother!&rdquo; Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s
      arm fell to his side: kneeling before him, and by the outcast&rsquo;s side, was
      his own young daughter; she had crept into the room unobserved, when her
      father entered. Through the dim shadows, relieved only by the red and
      fitful gleam of the fire, he saw her fair meek face looking up wistfully
      at his own, with tears of excitement, and perhaps of pity&mdash;for
      children have a quick insight into the reality of grief in those not far
      removed from their own years&mdash;glistening in her soft eyes. Philip
      looked round bewildered, and he saw that face which seemed to him, at such
      a time, like the face of an angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear her!&rdquo; he murmured: &ldquo;Oh, hear her! For her sake, do not sever one
      orphan from the other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take away that child, Mrs. Beaufort,&rdquo; cried Robert, angrily. &ldquo;Will you
      let her disgrace herself thus? And you, sir, begone from this roof; and
      when you can approach me with due respect, I will give you, as I said I
      would, the means to get an honest living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip rose; Mrs. Beaufort had already led away her daughter, and she took
      that opportunity of sending in the servants: their forms filled up the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; continued Mr. Beaufort, more and more emboldened, as he saw
      the menials at hand, &ldquo;or shall they expel you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is enough, sir,&rdquo; said Philip, with a sudden calm and dignity that
      surprised and almost awed his uncle. &ldquo;My father, if the dead yet watch
      over the living, has seen and heard you. There will come a day for
      justice. Out of my path, hirelings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his arm, and the menials shrank back at his tread, stalked across
      the inhospitable hall, and vanished. When he had gained the street, he
      turned and looked up at the house. His dark and hollow eyes, gleaming
      through the long and raven hair that fell profusely over his face, had in
      them an expression of menace almost preternatural, from its settled
      calmness; the wild and untutored majesty which, though rags and squalor,
      never deserted his form, as it never does the forms of men in whom the
      will is strong and the sense of injustice deep; the outstretched arm the
      haggard, but noble features; the bloomless and scathed youth, all gave to
      his features and his stature an aspect awful in its sinister and voiceless
      wrath. There he stood a moment, like one to whom woe and wrong have given
      a Prophet&rsquo;s power, guiding the eye of the unforgetful Fate to the roof of
      the Oppressor. Then slowly, and with a half smile, he turned away, and
      strode through the streets till he arrived at one of the narrow lanes that
      intersect the more equivocal quarters of the huge city. He stopped at the
      private entrance of a small pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop; the door was opened by a
      slipshod boy; he ascended the dingy stairs till he came to the second
      floor; and there, in a small back room, he found Captain de Burgh Smith,
      seated before a table with a couple of candles on it, smoking a cigar, and
      playing at cards by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what news of your brother, Bully Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None: they will reveal nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you give him up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! My hope now is in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought you would be driven to come to me, and I will do
      something for you that I should not loike to do for myself. I told you
      that I knew the Bow Street runner who was in the barouche. I will find him
      out&mdash;Heaven knows that is easily done; and, if you can pay well, you
      will get your news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have all I possess, if you restore my brother. See what it is,
      one hundred pounds&mdash;it was his fortune. It is useless to me without
      him. There, take fifty now, and if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip stopped, for his voice trembled too much to allow him farther
      speech. Captain Smith thrust the notes into his pocket, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll consider it settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Smith fulfilled his promise. He saw the Bow Street officer. Mr.
      Sharp had been bribed too high by the opposite party to tell tales, and he
      willingly encouraged the suspicion that Sidney was under the care of the
      Beauforts. He promised, however, for the sake of ten guineas, to procure
      Philip a letter from Sidney himself. This was all he would undertake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was satisfied. At the end of another week, Mr. Sharp transmitted to
      the Captain a letter, which he, in his turn, gave to Philip. It ran thus,
      in Sidney&rsquo;s own sprawling hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR BROTHER PHILIP,&mdash;I am told you wish to know how I am, and
      therfore take up my pen, and assure you that I write all out of my own
      head. I am very Comfortable and happy&mdash;much more so than I have been
      since poor deir mama died; so I beg you won&rsquo;t vex yourself about me: and
      pray don&rsquo;t try and Find me out, For I would not go with you again for the
      world. I am so much better Off here. I wish you would be a good boy, and
      leave off your Bad ways; for I am sure, as every one says, I don&rsquo;t know
      what would have become of me if I had staid with you. Mr. [the Mr. half
      scratched out] the gentleman I am with, says if you turn out Properly, he
      will be a friend to you, Too; but he advises you to go, like a Good boy,
      to Arthur Beaufort, and ask his pardon for the past, and then Arthur will
      be very kind to you. I send you a great Big sum of L20., and the gentleman
      says he would send more, only it might make you naughty, and set up. I go
      to church now every Sunday, and read good books, and always pray that God
      may open your eyes. I have such a Nice Pony, with such a long tale. So no
      more at present from your affectionate brother, SIDNEY MORTON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oct. 8, 18&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, pray don&rsquo;t come after me Any more. You know I neerly died of it,
      but for this deir good gentleman I am with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So this, then, was the crowning reward of all his sufferings and all his
      love! There was the letter, evidently undictated, with its errors of
      orthography, and in the child&rsquo;s rough scrawl; the serpent&rsquo;s tooth pierced
      to the heart, and left there its most lasting venom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done with him for ever,&rdquo; said Philip, brushing away the bitter
      tears. &ldquo;I will molest him no farther; I care no more to pierce this
      mystery. Better for him as it is&mdash;he is happy! Well, well, and I&mdash;I
      will never care for a human being again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head over his hands; and when he rose, his heart felt to him
      like stone. It seemed as if Conscience herself had fled from his soul on
      the wings of departed Love.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;But you have found the mountain&rsquo;s top&mdash;there sit
        On the calm flourishing head of it;
        And whilst with wearied steps we upward go,

</pre>
    <p>
      It was true that Sidney was happy in his new home, and thither we must now
      trace him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the town where the travellers in the barouche had been
      requested to leave Sidney, &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Arms&rdquo; was precisely the inn
      eschewed by Mr. Spencer. While the horses were being changed, he summoned
      the surgeon of the town to examine the child, who had already much
      recovered; and by stripping his clothes, wrapping him in warm blankets,
      and administering cordials, he was permitted to reach another stage, so as
      to baffle pursuit that night; and in three days Mr. Spencer had placed his
      new charge with his maiden sisters, a hundred and fifty miles from the
      spot where he had been found. He would not take him to his own home yet.
      He feared the claims of Arthur Beaufort. He artfully wrote to that
      gentleman, stating that he had abandoned the chase of Sidney in despair,
      and desiring to know if he had discovered him; and a bribe of L300. to Mr.
      Sharp with a candid exposition of his reasons for secreting Sidney&mdash;reasons
      in which the worthy officer professed to sympathise&mdash;secured the
      discretion of his ally. But he would not deny himself the pleasure of
      being in the same house with Sidney, and was therefore for some months the
      guest of his sisters. At length he heard that young Beaufort had been
      ordered abroad for his health, and he then deemed it safe to transfer his
      new idol to his Lares by the lakes. During this interval the current of
      the younger Morton&rsquo;s life had indeed flowed through flowers. At his age
      the cares of females were almost a want as well as a luxury, and the
      sisters spoiled and petted him as much as any elderly nymphs in Cytherea
      ever petted Cupid. They were good, excellent, high-nosed, flat-bosomed
      spinsters, sentimentally fond of their brother, whom they called &ldquo;the
      poet,&rdquo; and dotingly attached to children. The cleanness, the quiet, the
      good cheer of their neat abode, all tended to revive and invigorate the
      spirits of their young guest, and every one there seemed to vie which
      should love him the most. Still his especial favourite was Mr. Spencer:
      for Spencer never went out without bringing back cakes and toys; and
      Spencer gave him his pony; and Spencer rode a little crop-eared nag by his
      side; and Spencer, in short, was associated with his every comfort and
      caprice. He told them his little history; and when he said how Philip had
      left him alone for long hours together, and how Philip had forced him to
      his last and nearly fatal journey, the old maids groaned, and the old
      bachelor sighed, and they all cried in a breath, that &ldquo;Philip was a very
      wicked boy.&rdquo; It was not only their obvious policy to detach him from his
      brother, but it was their sincere conviction that they did right to do so.
      Sidney began, it is true, by taking Philip&rsquo;s part; but his mind was
      ductile, and he still looked back with a shudder to the hardships he had
      gone through: and so by little and little he learned to forget all the
      endearing and fostering love Philip had evinced to him; to connect his
      name with dark and mysterious fears; to repeat thanksgivings to Providence
      that he was saved from him; and to hope that they might never meet again.
      In fact, when Mr. Spencer learned from Sharp that it was through Captain
      Smith, the swindler, that application had been made by Philip for news of
      his brother, and having also learned before, from the same person, that
      Philip had been implicated in the sale of a horse, swindled, if not
      stolen, he saw every additional reason to widen the stream that flowed
      between the wolf and the lamb. The older Sidney grew, the better he
      comprehended and appreciated the motives of his protector&mdash;for he was
      brought up in a formal school of propriety and ethics, and his mind
      naturally revolted from all images of violence or fraud. Mr. Spencer
      changed both the Christian and the surname of his protege, in order to
      elude the search whether of Philip, the Mortons, or the Beauforts, and
      Sidney passed for his nephew by a younger brother who had died in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there, by the calm banks of the placid lake, amidst the fairest
      landscapes of the Island Garden, the youngest born of Catherine passed his
      tranquil days. The monotony of the retreat did not fatigue a spirit which,
      as he grew up, found occupation in books, music, poetry, and the elegances
      of the cultivated, if quiet, life within his reach. To the rough past he
      looked back as to an evil dream, in which the image of Philip stood dark
      and threatening. His brother&rsquo;s name as he grew older he rarely mentioned;
      and if he did volunteer it to Mr. Spencer, the bloom on his cheek grew
      paler. The sweetness of his manners, his fair face and winning smile,
      still continued to secure him love, and to screen from the common eye
      whatever of selfishness yet lurked in his nature. And, indeed, that fault
      in so serene a career, and with friends so attached, was seldom called
      into action. So thus was he severed from both the protectors, Arthur and
      Philip, to whom poor Catherine had bequeathed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a perverse and strange mystery, they, to whom the charge was most
      intrusted were the very persons who were forbidden to redeem it. On our
      death-beds when we think we have provided for those we leave behind&mdash;should
      we lose the last smile that gilds the solemn agony, if we could look one
      year into the Future?
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Beaufort, after an ineffectual search for Sidney, heard, on
      returning to his home, no unexaggerated narrative of Philip&rsquo;s visit, and
      listened, with deep resentment, to his mother&rsquo;s distorted account of the
      language addressed to her. It is not to be surprised that, with all his
      romantic generosity, he felt sickened and revolted at violence that seemed
      to him without excuse. Though not a revengeful character, he had not that
      meekness which never resents. He looked upon Philip Morton as upon one
      rendered incorrigible by bad passions and evil company. Still Catherine&rsquo;s
      last request, and Philip&rsquo;s note to him, the Unknown Comforter, often
      recurred to him, and he would have willingly yet aided him had Philip been
      thrown in his way. But as it was, when he looked around, and saw the
      examples of that charity that begins at home, in which the world abounds,
      he felt as if he had done his duty; and prosperity having, though it could
      not harden his heart, still sapped the habits of perseverance, so by
      little and little the image of the dying Catherine, and the thought of her
      sons, faded from his remembrance. And for this there was the more excuse
      after the receipt of an anonymous letter, which relieved all his
      apprehensions on behalf of Sidney. The letter was short, and stated simply
      that Sidney Morton had found a friend who would protect him throughout
      life; but who would not scruple to apply to Beaufort if ever he needed his
      assistance. So one son, and that the youngest and the best loved, was
      safe. And the other, had he not chosen his own career? Alas, poor
      Catherine! when you fancied that Philip was the one sure to force his way
      into fortune, and Sidney the one most helpless, how ill did you judge of
      the human heart! It was that very strength of Philip&rsquo;s nature which
      tempted the winds that scattered the blossoms, and shook the stem to its
      roots; while the lighter and frailer nature bent to the gale, and bore
      transplanting to a happier soil. If a parent read these pages, let him
      pause and think well on the characters of his children; let him at once
      fear and hope the most for the one whose passions and whose temper lead to
      a struggle with the world. That same world is a tough wrestler, and has a
      bear&rsquo;s gripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Arthur Beaufort&rsquo;s own complaints, which grew serious and
      menaced consumption, recalled his thoughts more and more every day to
      himself. He was compelled to abandon his career at the University, and to
      seek for health in the softer breezes of the South. His parents
      accompanied him to Nice; and when, at the end of a few months, he was
      restored to health, the desire of travel seized the mind and attracted the
      fancy of the young heir. His father and mother, satisfied with his
      recovery, and not unwilling that he should acquire the polish of
      Continental intercourse, returned to England; and young Beaufort, with gay
      companions and munificent income, already courted, spoiled, and flattered,
      commenced his tour with the fair climes of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, O dark mystery of the Moral World!&mdash;so, unlike the order of the
      External Universe, glide together, side by side, the shadowy steeds of
      NIGHT AND MORNING. Examine life in its own world; confound not that world,
      the inner one, the practical one, with the more visible, yet airier and
      less substantial system, doing homage to the sun, to whose throne, afar in
      the infinite space, the human heart has no wings to flee. In life, the
      mind and the circumstance give the true seasons, and regulate the darkness
      and the light. Of two men standing on the same foot of earth, the one
      revels in the joyous noon, the other shudders in the solitude of night.
      For Hope and Fortune, the day-star is ever shining. For Care and Penury,
      Night changes not with the ticking of the clock, nor with the shadow on
      the dial. Morning for the heir, night for the houseless, and God&rsquo;s eye
      over both.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;The knight of arts and industry,
        And his achievements fair.&rdquo;
    THOMSON&rsquo;S Castle of Indolence: Explanatory Verse to Canto II.
</pre>
    <p>
      In a popular and respectable, but not very fashionable quartier in Paris,
      and in the tolerably broad and effective locale of the Rue &mdash;&mdash;,
      there might be seen, at the time I now treat of, a curious-looking
      building, that jutted out semicircularly from the neighbouring shops, with
      plaster pilasters and compo ornaments. The virtuosi of the quartier had
      discovered that the building was constructed in imitation of an ancient
      temple in Rome; this erection, then fresh and new, reached only to the
      entresol. The pilasters were painted light green and gilded in the
      cornices, while, surmounting the architrave, were three little statues&mdash;one
      held a torch, another a bow, and a third a bag; they were therefore
      rumoured, I know not with what justice, to be the artistical
      representatives of Hymen, Cupid and Fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the door was neatly engraved, on a brass plate, the following
      inscription:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         &ldquo;MONSIEUR LOVE, ANGLAIS,
            A L&rsquo;ENTRESOL.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And if you had crossed the threshold and mounted the stairs, and gained
      that mysterious story inhabited by Monsieur Love, you would have seen,
      upon another door to the right, another epigraph, informing those
      interested in the inquiry that the bureau, of M. Love was open daily from
      nine in the morning to four in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office of M. Love&mdash;for office it was, and of a nature not
      unfrequently designated in the &ldquo;petites affiches&rdquo; of Paris&mdash;had been
      established about six months; and whether it was the popularity of the
      profession, or the shape of the shop, or the manners of M. Love himself, I
      cannot pretend to say, but certain it is that the Temple of Hymen&mdash;as
      M. Love classically termed it&mdash;had become exceedingly in vogue in the
      Faubourg St.&mdash;. It was rumoured that no less than nine marriages in
      the immediate neighbourhood had been manufactured at this fortunate
      office, and that they had all turned out happily except one, in which the
      bride being sixty, and the bridegroom twenty-four, there had been rumours
      of domestic dissension; but as the lady had been delivered,&mdash;I mean
      of her husband, who had drowned himself in the Seine, about a month after
      the ceremony, things had turned out in the long run better than might have
      been expected, and the widow was so little discouraged; that she had been
      seen to enter the office already&mdash;a circumstance that was greatly to
      the credit of Mr. Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the secret of Mr. Love&rsquo;s success, and of the marked superiority of
      his establishment in rank and popularity over similar ones, consisted in
      the spirit and liberality with which the business was conducted. He seemed
      resolved to destroy all formality between parties who might desire to draw
      closer to each other, and he hit upon the lucky device of a table d&rsquo;hote,
      very well managed, and held twice a-week, and often followed by a soiree
      dansante; so that, if they pleased, the aspirants to matrimonial happiness
      might become acquainted without <i>gene</i>. As he himself was a jolly,
      convivial fellow of much <i>savoir vivre</i>, it is astonishing how well
      he made these entertainments answer. Persons who had not seemed to take to
      each other in the first distant interview grew extremely enamoured when
      the corks of the champagne&mdash;an extra of course in the abonnement&mdash;bounced
      against the wall. Added to this, Mr. Love took great pains to know the
      tradesmen in his neighbourhood; and, what with his jokes, his appearance
      of easy circumstances, and the fluency with which he spoke the language,
      he became a universal favourite. Many persons who were uncommonly starched
      in general, and who professed to ridicule the bureau, saw nothing improper
      in dining at the table d&rsquo;hote. To those who wished for secrecy he was said
      to be wonderfully discreet; but there were others who did not affect to
      conceal their discontent at the single state: for the rest, the
      entertainments were so contrived as never to shock the delicacy, while
      they always forwarded the suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and Mr. Love was still seated
      at dinner, or rather at dessert, with a party of guests. His apartments,
      though small, were somewhat gaudily painted and furnished, and his
      dining-room was decorated a la Turque. The party consisted&mdash;first, of
      a rich epicier, a widower, Monsieur Goupille by name, an eminent man in
      the Faubourg; he was in his grand climacteric, but still belhomme; wore a
      very well-made peruque of light auburn, with tight pantaloons, which
      contained a pair of very respectable calves; and his white neckcloth and
      his large frill were washed and got up with especial care. Next to
      Monsieur Goupille sat a very demure and very spare young lady of about
      two-and-thirty, who was said to have saved a fortune&mdash;Heaven knows
      how&mdash;in the family of a rich English milord, where she had officiated
      as governess; she called herself Mademoiselle Adele de Courval, and was
      very particular about the de, and very melancholy about her ancestors.
      Monsieur Goupille generally put his finger through his peruque, and fell
      away a little on his left pantaloon when he spoke to Mademoiselle de
      Courval, and Mademoiselle de Courval generally pecked at her bouquet when
      she answered Monsieur Goupille. On the other side of this young lady sat a
      fine-looking fair man&mdash;M. Sovolofski, a Pole, buttoned up to the
      chin, and rather threadbare, though uncommonly neat. He was flanked by a
      little fat lady, who had been very pretty, and who kept a boarding-house,
      or pension, for the English, she herself being English, though long
      established in Paris. Rumour said she had been gay in her youth, and
      dropped in Paris by a Russian nobleman, with a very pretty settlement, she
      and the settlement having equally expanded by time and season: she was
      called Madame Beavor. On the other side of the table was a red-headed
      Englishman, who spoke very little French; who had been told that French
      ladies were passionately fond of light hair; and who, having L2000. of his
      own, intended to quadruple that sum by a prudent marriage. Nobody knew
      what his family was, but his name was Higgins. His neighbour was an
      exceedingly tall, large-boned Frenchman, with a long nose and a red
      riband, who was much seen at Frascati&rsquo;s, and had served under Napoleon.
      Then came another lady, extremely pretty, very piquante, and very gay, but
      past the premiere jeunesse, who ogled Mr. Love more than she did any of
      his guests: she was called Rosalie Caumartin, and was at the head of a
      large bon-bon establishment; married, but her husband had gone four years
      ago to the Isle of France, and she was a little doubtful whether she might
      not be justly entitled to the privileges of a widow. Next to Mr. Love, in
      the place of honour, sat no less a person than the Vicomte de Vaudemont, a
      French gentleman, really well-born, but whose various excesses, added to
      his poverty, had not served to sustain that respect for his birth which he
      considered due to it. He had already been twice married; once to an
      Englishwoman, who had been decoyed by the title; by this lady, who died in
      childbed, he had one son; a fact which he sedulously concealed from the
      world of Paris by keeping the unhappy boy&mdash;who was now some eighteen
      or nineteen years old&mdash;a perpetual exile in England. Monsieur de
      Vaudemont did not wish to pass for more than thirty, and he considered
      that to produce a son of eighteen would be to make the lad a monster of
      ingratitude by giving the lie every hour to his own father! In spite of
      this precaution the Vicomte found great difficulty in getting a third wife&mdash;especially
      as he had no actual land and visible income; was, not seamed, but ploughed
      up, with the small-pox; small of stature, and was considered more than un
      peu bete. He was, however, a prodigious dandy, and wore a lace frill and
      embroidered waistcoat. Mr. Love&rsquo;s vis-a-vis was Mr. Birnie, an Englishman,
      a sort of assistant in the establishment, with a hard, dry, parchment
      face, and a remarkable talent for silence. The host himself was a splendid
      animal; his vast chest seemed to occupy more space at the table than any
      four of his guests, yet he was not corpulent or unwieldy; he was dressed
      in black, wore a velvet stock very high, and four gold studs glittered in
      his shirt-front; he was bald to the crown, which made his forehead appear
      singularly lofty, and what hair he had left was a little greyish and
      curled; his face was shaved smoothly, except a close-clipped mustache; and
      his eyes, though small, were bright and piercing. Such was the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the best bon-bons I ever ate,&rdquo; said Mr. Love, glancing at
      Madame Caumartin. &ldquo;My fair friends, have compassion on the table of a poor
      bachelor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you ought not to be a bachelor, Monsieur Lofe,&rdquo; replied the fair
      Rosalie, with an arch look; &ldquo;you who make others marry, should set the
      example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; answered Mr. Love, nodding; &ldquo;one serves one&rsquo;s
      customers to so much happiness that one has none left for one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a loud explosion was heard. Monsieur Goupille had pulled one of the
      bon-bon crackers with Mademoiselle Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the motto!&mdash;no&mdash;Monsieur has it: I&rsquo;m always unlucky,&rdquo;
       said the gentle Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      The epicier solemnly unrolled the little slip of paper; the print was very
      small, and he longed to take out his spectacles, but he thought that would
      make him look old. However, he spelled through the motto with some
      difficulty:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Comme elle fait soumettre un coeur,
        En refusant son doux hommage,
        On peut traiter la coquette en vainqueur;
        De la beauty modeste on cherit l&rsquo;esclavage.&rdquo;
 
   [The coquette, who subjugates a heart, yet refuses its tender
   homage, one may treat as a conqueror: of modest beauty we cherish
   the slavery.]
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I present it to Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, laying the motto solemnly in
      Adele&rsquo;s plate, upon a little mountain of chestnut-husks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very pretty,&rdquo; said she, looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very a propos,&rdquo; whispered the epicier, caressing the peruque a
      little too roughly in his emotion. Mr. Love gave him a kick under the
      table, and put his finger to his own bald head, and then to his nose,
      significantly. The intelligent epicier smoothed back the irritated
      peruque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you fond of bon-bons, Mademoiselle Adele? I have a very fine stock at
      home,&rdquo; said Monsieur Goupille. Mademoiselle Adele de Courval sighed:
      &ldquo;Helas! they remind me of happier days, when I was a petite and my dear
      grandmamma took me in her lap and told me how she escaped the guillotine:
      she was an emigree, and you know her father was a marquis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The epicier bowed and looked puzzled. He did not quite see the connection
      between the bon-bons and the guillotine. &ldquo;You are triste, Monsieur,&rdquo;
       observed Madame Beavor, in rather a piqued tone, to the Pole, who had not
      said a word since the roti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, an exile is always triste: I think of my pauvre pays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried Mr. Love. &ldquo;Think that there is no exile by the side of a
      belle dame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pole smiled mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull it,&rdquo; said Madame Beavor, holding a cracker to the patriot, and
      turning away her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madame; I wish it were a cannon in defence of La Pologne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this magniloquent aspiration, the gallant Sovolofski pulled lustily,
      and then rubbed his fingers, with a little grimace, observing that
      crackers were sometimes dangerous, and that the present combustible was
      d&rsquo;une force immense.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Helas! J&rsquo;ai cru jusqu&rsquo;a ce jour
          Pouvoir triompher de l&rsquo;amour,&rdquo;
 
   [Alas! I believed until to-day that I could triumph over love.]
</pre>
    <p>
      said Madame Beavor, reading the motto. &ldquo;What do you say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, there is no triumph for La Pologne!&rdquo; Madame Beavor uttered a
      little peevish exclamation, and glanced in despair at her red-headed
      countryman. &ldquo;Are you, too, a great politician, sir?&rdquo; said she in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mem!&mdash;I&rsquo;m all for the ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; asked Madame Caumartin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Higgins est tout pour les dames.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he is,&rdquo; cried Mr. Love; &ldquo;all the English are, especially with
      that coloured hair; a lady who likes a passionate adorer should always
      marry a man with gold-coloured hair&mdash;always. What do you say,
      Mademoiselle Adele?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I like fair hair,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle, looking bashfully askew at
      Monsieur Goupille&rsquo;s peruque. &ldquo;Grandmamma said her papa&mdash;the marquis&mdash;used
      yellow powder: it must have been very pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a la sucre d&rsquo; orge,&rdquo; remarked the epicier, smiling on the right
      side of his mouth, where his best teeth were. Mademoiselle de Courval
      looked displeased. &ldquo;I fear you are a republican, Monsieur Goupille.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Mademoiselle. No; I&rsquo;m for the Restoration;&rdquo; and again the epicier
      perplexed himself to discover the association of idea between
      republicanism and sucre d&rsquo;orge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another glass of wine. Come, another,&rdquo; said Mr. Love, stretching across
      the Vicomte to help Madame Canmartin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the tall Frenchman with the riband, eying the epicier with
      great disdain, &ldquo;you say you are for the Restoration&mdash;I am for the
      Empire&mdash;Moi!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No politics!&rdquo; cried Mr. Love. &ldquo;Let us adjourn to the salon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomte, who had seemed supremely ennuye during this dialogue, plucked
      Mr. Love by the sleeve as he rose, and whispered petulantly, &ldquo;I do not see
      any one here to suit me, Monsieur Love&mdash;none of my rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; answered Mr. Love: &ldquo;point d&rsquo; argent point de Suisse. I could
      introduce you to a duchess, but then the fee is high. There&rsquo;s Mademoiselle
      de Courval&mdash;she dates from the Carlovingians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very like a boiled sole,&rdquo; answered the Vicomte, with a wry face.
      &ldquo;Still&mdash;what dower has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty thousand francs, and sickly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Love; &ldquo;but she likes a
      tall man, and Monsieur Goupille is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tall men are never well made,&rdquo; interrupted the Vicomte, angrily; and he
      drew himself aside as Mr. Love, gallantly advancing, gave his arm to
      Madame Beavor, because the Pole had, in rising, folded both his own arms
      across his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr. Love to Madame Beavor, as they adjourned to
      the salon, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you manage that brave man well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma foi, comme il est ennuyeux avec sa Pologne,&rdquo; replied Madame Beavor,
      shrugging her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but he is a very fine-shaped man; and it is a comfort to think that
      one will have no rival but his country. Trust me, and encourage him a
      little more; I think he would suit you to a T.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the attendant engaged for the evening announced Monsieur and Madame
      Giraud; whereupon there entered a little&mdash;little couple, very fair,
      very plump, and very like each other. This was Mr. Love&rsquo;s show couple&mdash;his
      decoy ducks&mdash;his last best example of match-making; they had been
      married two months out of the bureau, and were the admiration of the
      neighbourhood for their conjugal affection. As they were now united, they
      had ceased to frequent the table d&rsquo;hote; but Mr. Love often invited them
      after the dessert, pour encourager les autres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear friends,&rdquo; cried Mr. Love, shaking each by the hand, &ldquo;I am
      ravished to see you. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Monsieur and
      Madame Giraud, the happiest couple in Christendom;&mdash;if I had done
      nothing else in my life but bring them together I should not have lived in
      vain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The company eyed the objects of this eulogium with great attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, my prayer is to deserve my bonheur,&rdquo; said Monsieur Giraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cher ange!&rdquo; murmured Madame: and the happy pair seated themselves next to
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Love, who was all for those innocent pastimes which do away with
      conventional formality and reserve, now proposed a game at &ldquo;Hunt the
      Slipper,&rdquo; which was welcomed by the whole party, except the Pole and the
      Vicomte; though Mademoiselle Adele looked prudish, and observed to the
      epicier, &ldquo;that Monsieur Lofe was so droll, but she should not have liked
      her pauvre grandmaman to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomte had stationed himself opposite to Mademoiselle de Courval, and
      kept his eyes fixed on her very tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, I see, does not approve of such bourgeois diversions,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; said the gentle Adele. &ldquo;But I think we must sacrifice our
      own tastes to those of the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very amiable sentiment,&rdquo; said the epicier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one attributed to grandmamma&rsquo;s papa, the Marquis de Courval. It has
      become quite a hackneyed remark since,&rdquo; said Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, ladies,&rdquo; said the joyous Rosalie; &ldquo;I volunteer my slipper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Asseyez-vous donc,&rdquo; said Madame Beavor to the Pole. &ldquo;Have you no games of
      this sort in Poland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, La Pologne is no more,&rdquo; said the Pole. &ldquo;But with the swords of
      her brave&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No swords here, if you please,&rdquo; said Mr. Love, putting his vast hands on
      the Pole&rsquo;s shoulder, and sinking him forcibly down into the circle now
      formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game proceeded with great vigour and much laughter from Rosalie, Mr.
      Love, and Madame Beavor, especially whenever the last thumped the Pole
      with the heel of the slipper. Monsieur Giraud was always sure that Madame
      Giraud had the slipper about her, which persuasion on his part gave rise
      to many little endearments, which are always so innocent among married
      people. The Vicomte and the epicier were equally certain the slipper was
      with Mademoiselle Adele, who defended herself with much more energy than
      might have been supposed in one so gentle. The epicier, however, grew
      jealous of the attentions of his noble rival, and told him that he gene&rsquo;d
      mademoiselle; whereupon the Vicomte called him an impertinent; and the
      tall Frenchman, with the riband, sprang up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I be of any assistance, gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith Mr. Love, the great peacemaker, interposed, and reconciling the
      rivals, proposed to change the game to Colin Maillard-Anglice, &ldquo;Blind
      Man&rsquo;s Buff.&rdquo; Rosalie clapped her hands, and offered herself to be
      blindfolded. The tables and chairs were cleared away; and Madame Beaver
      pushed the Pole into Rosalie&rsquo;s arms, who, having felt him about the face
      for some moments, guessed him to be the tall Frenchman. During this time
      Monsieur and Madame Giraud hid themselves behind the window-curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amuse yourself, _mon ami_,&rdquo; said Madame Beaver, to the liberated Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; sighed Monsieur Sovolofski, &ldquo;how can I be gay! All my
      property confiscated by the Emperor of Russia! Has La Pologne no Brutus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are in love,&rdquo; said the host, clapping him on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure,&rdquo; whispered the Pole to the matchmaker, &ldquo;that Madame
      Beavor has vingt mille livres de rentes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a sous less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pole mused, and, glancing at Madame Beavor, said, &ldquo;And yet, madame,
      your charming gaiety consoles me amidst all my suffering;&rdquo; upon which
      Madame Beavor called him &ldquo;flatterer,&rdquo; and rapped his knuckles with her
      fan; the latter proceeding the brave Pole did not seem to like, for he
      immediately buried his hands in his trousers&rsquo; pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game was now at its meridian. Rosalie was uncommonly active, and flew
      about here and there, much to the harassment of the Pole, who repeatedly
      wiped his forehead, and observed that it was warm work, and put him in
      mind of the last sad battle for La Pologne. Monsieur Goupille, who had
      lately taken lessons in dancing, and was vain of his agility&mdash;mounted
      the chairs and tables, as Rosalie approached&mdash;with great grace and
      gravity. It so happened that, in these saltations, he ascended a stool
      near the curtain behind which Monsieur and Madame Giraud were ensconced.
      Somewhat agitated by a slight flutter behind the folds, which made him
      fancy, on the sudden panic, that Rosalie was creeping that way, the
      epicier made an abrupt pirouette, and the hook on which the curtains were
      suspended caught his left coat-tail,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;The fatal vesture left the unguarded side;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      just as he turned to extricate the garment from that dilemma, Rosalie
      sprang upon him, and naturally lifting her hands to that height where she
      fancied the human face divine, took another extremity of Monsieur
      Goupille&rsquo;s graceful frame thus exposed, by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who this is. Quelle drole de visage!&rdquo; muttered Rosalie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mais, madame,&rdquo; faltered Monsieur Goupille, looking greatly disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle Adele, who did not seem to relish this adventure, came to the
      relief of her wooer, and pinched Rosalie very sharply in the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair. But I will know who this is,&rdquo; cried Rosalie, angrily;
      &ldquo;you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t escape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden and universal burst of laughter roused her suspicions&mdash;she
      drew back&mdash;and exclaiming, &ldquo;Mais quelle mauvaise plaisanterie; c&rsquo;est
      trop fort!&rdquo; applied her fair hand to the place in dispute, with so hearty
      a good-will, that Monsieur Goupille uttered a dolorous cry, and sprang
      from the chair leaving the coat-tail (the cause of all his woe) suspended
      upon the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at this moment, and in the midst of the excitement caused by
      Monsieur Goupille&rsquo;s misfortune, that the door opened, and the attendant
      reappeared, followed by a young man in a large cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer paused at the threshold, and gazed around him in evident
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diable!&rdquo; said Mr. Love, approaching, and gazing hard at the stranger. &ldquo;Is
      it possible?&mdash;You are come at last? Welcome!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the stranger, apparently still bewildered, &ldquo;there is some
      mistake; you are not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am Mr. Love!&mdash;Love all the world over. How is our friend
      Gregg?&mdash;told you to address yourself to Mr. Love,&mdash;eh?&mdash;Mum!&mdash;Ladies
      and gentlemen, an acquisition to our party. Fine fellow, eh?&mdash;Five
      feet eleven without his shoes,&mdash;and young enough to hope to be thrice
      married before he dies. When did you arrive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus, Philip Morton and Mr. William Gawtrey met once more.

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy the man who, void of care and strife, In silken or in leathern
      purse retains A splendid shilling!&rdquo;&mdash;The Splendid Shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wherefore should they take or care for thought, The unreasoning
      vulgar willingly obey, And leaving toil and poverty behind. Run forth by
      different ways, the blissful boon to find.&rdquo; WEST&rsquo;S Education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, boy! your story interests me. The events are romantic, but the
      moral is practical, old, everlasting&mdash;life, boy, life. Poverty by
      itself is no such great curse; that is, if it stops short of starving. And
      passion by itself is a noble thing, sir; but poverty and passion together&mdash;poverty
      and feeling&mdash;poverty and pride&mdash;the poverty one is not born to,&mdash;but
      falls into;&mdash;and the man who ousts you out of your easy-chair,
      kicking you with every turn he takes, as he settles himself more
      comfortably&mdash;why there&rsquo;s no romance in that&mdash;hard every-day
      life, sir! Well, well:&mdash;so after your brother&rsquo;s letter you resigned
      yourself to that fellow Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I gave him my money, not my soul. I turned from his door, with a few
      shillings that he himself thrust into my hand, and walked on&mdash;I cared
      not whither&mdash;out of the town, into the fields&mdash;till night came;
      and then, just as I suddenly entered on the high-road, many miles away,
      the moon rose; and I saw, by the hedge-side, something that seemed like a
      corpse; it was an old beggar, in the last state of raggedness, disease,
      and famine. He had laid himself down to die. I shared with him what I had,
      and helped him to a little inn. As he crossed the threshold, he turned
      round and blessed me. Do you know, the moment I heard that blessing a
      stone seemed rolled away from my heart? I said to myself, &lsquo;What then! even
      I can be of use to some one; and I am better off than that old man, for I
      have youth and health.&rsquo; As these thoughts stirred in me, my limbs, before
      heavy with fatigue, grew light; a strange kind of excitement seized me. I
      ran on gaily beneath the moonlight that smiled over the crisp, broad road.
      I felt as if no house, not even a palace, were large enough for me that
      night. And when, at last, wearied out, I crept into a wood, and laid
      myself down to sleep, I still murmured to myself, &lsquo;I have youth and
      health.&rsquo; But, in the morning, when I rose, I stretched out my arms, and
      missed my brother!... In two or three days I found employment with a
      farmer; but we quarrelled after a few weeks; for once he wished to strike
      me; and somehow or other I could work, but not serve. Winter had begun
      when we parted.&mdash;Oh, such a winter!&mdash;Then&mdash;then I knew what
      it was to be houseless. How I lived for some months&mdash;if to live it
      can be called&mdash;it would pain you to hear, and humble me to tell. At
      last, I found myself again in London; and one evening, not many days
      since, I resolved at last&mdash;for nothing else seemed left, and I had
      not touched food for two days&mdash;to come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did that never occur to you before?&rdquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Philip, with a deep blush,&mdash;&ldquo;because I trembled at
      the power over my actions and my future life that I was to give to one,
      whom I was to bless as a benefactor, yet distrust as a guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Love, or Gawtrey, with a singular mixture of irony and
      compassion in his voice; &ldquo;and it was hunger, then, that terrified you at
      last even more than I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps hunger&mdash;or perhaps rather the reasoning that comes from
      hunger. I had not, I say, touched food for two days; and I was standing on
      that bridge, from which on one side you see the palace of a head of the
      Church, on the other the towers of the Abbey, within which the men I have
      read of in history lie buried. It was a cold, frosty evening, and the
      river below looked bright with the lamps and stars. I leaned, weak and
      sickening, against the wall of the bridge; and in one of the arched
      recesses beside me a cripple held out his hat for pence. I envied him!&mdash;he
      had a livelihood; he was inured to it, perhaps bred to it; he had no
      shame. By a sudden impulse, I, too, turned abruptly round&mdash;held out
      my hand to the first passenger, and started at the shrillness of my own
      voice, as it cried &lsquo;Charity.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey threw another log on the fire, looked complacently round the
      comfortable room, and rubbed his hands. The young man continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You should be ashamed of yourself&mdash;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to give you to
      the police,&rsquo; was the answer, in a pert and sharp tone. I looked up, and
      saw the livery my father&rsquo;s menials had worn. I had been begging my bread
      from Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s lackey! I said nothing; the man went on his
      business on tiptoe, that the mud might not splash above the soles of his
      shoes. Then, thoughts so black that they seemed to blot out every star
      from the sky&mdash;thoughts I had often wrestled against, but to which I
      now gave myself up with a sort of mad joy&mdash;seized me: and I
      remembered you. I had still preserved the address you gave me; I went
      straight to the house. Your friend, on naming you, received me kindly, and
      without question placed food before me&mdash;pressed on me clothing and
      money&mdash;procured me a passport&mdash;gave me your address&mdash;and
      now I am beneath your roof. Gawtrey, I know nothing yet of the world but
      the dark side of it. I know not what to deem you&mdash;but as you alone
      have been kind to me, so it is to your kindness rather than your aid, that
      I now cling&mdash;your kind words and kind looks&mdash;yet&mdash;&rdquo; he
      stopped short, and breathed hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you would know more of me. Faith, my boy, I cannot tell you more at
      this moment. I believe, to speak fairly, I don&rsquo;t live exactly within the
      pale of the law. But I&rsquo;m not a villain! I never plundered my friend and
      called it play!&mdash;I never murdered my friend and called it honour!&mdash;I
      never seduced my friend&rsquo;s wife and called it gallantry!&rdquo; As Gawtrey said
      this, he drew the words out, one by one, through his grinded teeth, paused
      and resumed more gaily: &ldquo;I struggle with Fortune; voila tout! I am not
      what you seem to suppose&mdash;not exactly a swindler, certainly not a
      robber! But, as I before told you, I am a charlatan, so is every man who
      strives to be richer or greater than he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, want kindness as much as you do. My bread and my cup are at your
      service. I will try and keep you unsullied, even by the clean dirt that
      now and then sticks to me. On the other hand, youth, my young friend, has
      no right to play the censor; and you must take me as you take the world,
      without being over-scrupulous and dainty. My present vocation pays well;
      in fact, I am beginning to lay by. My real name and past life are
      thoroughly unknown, and as yet unsuspected, in this quartier; for though I
      have seen much of Paris, my career hitherto has passed in other parts of
      the city;&mdash;and for the rest, own that I am well disguised! What a
      benevolent air this bald forehead gives me&mdash;eh? True,&rdquo; added Gawtrey,
      somewhat more seriously, &ldquo;if I saw how you could support yourself in a
      broader path of life than that in which I pick out my own way, I might say
      to you, as a gay man of fashion might say to some sober stripling&mdash;nay,
      as many a dissolute father says (or ought to say) to his son, &lsquo;It is no
      reason you should be a sinner, because I am not a saint.&rsquo; In a word, if
      you were well off in a respectable profession, you might have safer
      acquaintances than myself. But, as it is, upon my word as a plain man, I
      don&rsquo;t see what you can do better.&rdquo; Gawtrey made this speech with so much
      frankness and ease, that it seemed greatly to relieve the listener, and
      when he wound up with, &ldquo;What say you? In fine, my life is that of a great
      schoolboy, getting into scrapes for the fun of it, and fighting his way
      out as he best can!&mdash;Will you see how you like it?&rdquo; Philip, with a
      confiding and grateful impulse, put his hand into Gawtrey&rsquo;s. The host
      shook it cordially, and, without saying another word, showed his guest
      into a little cabinet where there was a sofa-bed, and they parted for the
      night. The new life upon which Philip Morton entered was so odd, so
      grotesque, and so amusing, that at his age it was, perhaps, natural that
      he should not be clear-sighted as to its danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Gawtrey was one of those men who are born to exert a certain
      influence and ascendency wherever they may be thrown; his vast strength,
      his redundant health, had a power of themselves&mdash;a moral as well as
      physical power. He naturally possessed high animal spirits, beneath the
      surface of which, however, at times, there was visible a certain
      undercurrent of malignity and scorn. He had evidently received a superior
      education, and could command at will the manner of a man not unfamiliar
      with a politer class of society. From the first hour that Philip had seen
      him on the top of the coach on the R&mdash;&mdash; road, this man had
      attracted his curiosity and interest; the conversation he had heard in the
      churchyard, the obligations he owed to Gawtrey in his escape from the
      officers of justice, the time afterwards passed in his society till they
      separated at the little inn, the rough and hearty kindliness Gawtrey had
      shown him at that period, and the hospitality extended to him now,&mdash;all
      contributed to excite his fancy, and in much, indeed very much, entitled
      this singular person to his gratitude. Morton, in a word, was fascinated;
      this man was the only friend he had made. I have not thought it necessary
      to detail to the reader the conversations that had taken place between
      them, during that passage of Morton&rsquo;s life when he was before for some
      days Gawtrey&rsquo;s companion; yet those conversations had sunk deep in his
      mind. He was struck, and almost awed, by the profound gloom which lurked
      under Gawtrey&rsquo;s broad humour&mdash;a gloom, not of temperament, but of
      knowledge. His views of life, of human justice and human virtue, were (as,
      to be sure, is commonly the case with men who have had reason to quarrel
      with the world) dreary and despairing; and Morton&rsquo;s own experience had
      been so sad, that these opinions were more influential than they could
      ever have been with the happy. However in this, their second reunion,
      there was a greater gaiety than in their first; and under his host&rsquo;s roof
      Morton insensibly, but rapidly, recovered something of the early and
      natural tone of his impetuous and ardent spirits. Gawtrey himself was
      generally a boon companion; their society, if not select, was merry. When
      their evenings were disengaged, Gawtrey was fond of haunting cafes and
      theatres, and Morton was his companion; Birnie (Mr. Gawtrey&rsquo;s partner)
      never accompanied them. Refreshed by this change of life, the very person
      of this young man regained its bloom and vigour, as a plant, removed from
      some choked atmosphere and unwholesome soil, where it had struggled for
      light and air, expands on transplanting; the graceful leaves burst from
      the long-drooping boughs, and the elastic crest springs upward to the sun
      in the glory of its young prime. If there was still a certain fiery
      sternness in his aspect, it had ceased, at least, to be haggard and
      savage, it even suited the character of his dark and expressive features.
      He might not have lost the something of the tiger in his fierce temper,
      but in the sleek hues and the sinewy symmetry of the frame he began to put
      forth also something of the tiger&rsquo;s beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Birnie did not sleep in the house, he went home nightly to a lodging
      at some little distance. We have said but little about this man, for, to
      all appearance, there was little enough to say; he rarely opened his own
      mouth except to Gawtrey, with whom Philip often observed him engaged in
      whispered conferences, to which he was not admitted. His eye, however, was
      less idle than his lips; it was not a bright eye: on the contrary, it was
      dull, and, to the unobservant, lifeless, of a pale blue, with a dim film
      over it&mdash;the eye of a vulture; but it had in it a calm, heavy,
      stealthy watchfulness, which inspired Morton with great distrust and
      aversion. Mr. Birnie not only spoke French like a native, but all his
      habits, his gestures, his tricks of manner, were French; not the French of
      good society, but more idiomatic, as it were, and popular. He was not
      exactly a vulgar person, he was too silent for that, but he was evidently
      of low extraction and coarse breeding; his accomplishments were of a
      mechanical nature; he was an extraordinary arithmetician, he was a very
      skilful chemist, and kept a laboratory at his lodgings&mdash;he mended his
      own clothes and linen with incomparable neatness. Philip suspected him of
      blacking his own shoes, but that was prejudice. Once he found Morton
      sketching horses&rsquo; heads&mdash;pour se desennuyer; and he made some short
      criticisms on the drawings, which showed him well acquainted with the art.
      Philip, surprised, sought to draw him into conversation; but Birnie eluded
      the attempt, and observed that he had once been an engraver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey himself did not seem to know much of the early life of this
      person, or at least he did not seem to like much to talk of him. The
      footstep of Mr. Birnie was gliding, noiseless, and catlike; he had no
      sociality in him&mdash;enjoyed nothing&mdash;drank hard&mdash;but was
      never drunk. Somehow or other, he had evidently over Gawtrey an influence
      little less than that which Gawtrey had over Morton, but it was of a
      different nature: Morton had conceived an extraordinary affection for his
      friend, while Gawtrey seemed secretly to dislike Birnie, and to be glad
      whenever he quitted his presence. It was, in truth, Gawtrey&rsquo;s custom when
      Birnie retired for the night, to rub his hands, bring out the punchbowl,
      squeeze the lemons, and while Philip, stretched on the sofa, listened to
      him, between sleep and waking, to talk on for the hour together, often
      till daybreak, with that bizarre mixture of knavery and feeling, drollery
      and sentiment, which made the dangerous charm of his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening as they thus sat together, Morton, after listening for some
      time to his companion&rsquo;s comments on men and things, said abruptly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawtrey! there is so much in you that puzzles me, so much which I find it
      difficult to reconcile with your present pursuits, that, if I ask no
      indiscreet confidence, I should like greatly to hear some account of your
      early life. It would please me to compare it with my own; when I am your
      age, I will then look back and see what I owed to your example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My early life! well&mdash;you shall hear it. It will put you on your
      guard, I hope, betimes against the two rocks of youth&mdash;love and
      friendship.&rdquo; Then, while squeezing the lemon into his favourite beverage,
      which Morton observed he made stronger than usual, Gawtrey thus commenced:

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;All his success must on himself depend,
        He had no money, counsel, guide, or friend;
        With spirit high John learned the world to brave,
        And in both senses was a ready knave.&rdquo;&mdash;CRABBE.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather sold walking-sticks and umbrellas in the little passage by
      Exeter &lsquo;Change; he was a man of genius and speculation. As soon as he had
      scraped together a little money, he lent it to some poor devil with a hard
      landlord, at twenty per cent., and made him take half the loan in
      umbrellas or bamboos. By these means he got his foot into the ladder, and
      climbed upward and upward, till, at the age of forty, he had amassed
      L5,000. He then looked about for a wife. An honest trader in the Strand,
      who dealt largely in cotton prints, possessed an only daughter; this young
      lady had a legacy, from a great-aunt, of L3,220., with a small street in
      St. Giles&rsquo;s, where the tenants paid weekly (all thieves or rogues&mdash;all,
      so their rents were sure). Now my grandfather conceived a great friendship
      for the father of this young lady; gave him a hint as to a new pattern in
      spotted cottons; enticed him to take out a patent, and lent him L700. for
      the speculation; applied for the money at the very moment cottons were at
      their worst, and got the daughter instead of the money,&mdash;by which
      exchange, you see, he won L2,520., to say nothing of the young lady. My
      grandfather then entered into partnership with the worthy trader, carried
      on the patent with spirit, and begat two sons. As he grew older, ambition
      seized him; his sons should be gentlemen&mdash;one was sent to College,
      the other put into a marching regiment. My grandfather meant to die worth
      a plum; but a fever he caught in visiting his tenants in St. Giles&rsquo;s
      prevented him, and he only left L20,000. equally divided between the sons.
      My father, the College man&rdquo; (here Gawtrey paused a moment, took a large
      draught of the punch, and resumed with a visible effort)&mdash;&ldquo;my father,
      the College man, was a person of rigid principles&mdash;bore an excellent
      character&mdash;had a great regard for the world. He married early and
      respectably. I am the sole fruit of that union; he lived soberly, his
      temper was harsh and morose, his home gloomy; he was a very severe father,
      and my mother died before I was ten years old. When I was fourteen, a
      little old Frenchman came to lodge with us; he had been persecuted under
      the old regime for being a philosopher; he filled my head with odd
      crotchets which, more or less, have stuck there ever since. At eighteen I
      was sent to St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. My father was rich enough to
      have let me go up in the higher rank of a pensioner, but he had lately
      grown avaricious; he thought that I was extravagant; he made me a sizar,
      perhaps to spite me. Then, for the first time, those inequalities in life
      which the Frenchman had dinned into my ears met me practically. A sizar!
      another name for a dog! I had such strength, health, and spirits, that I
      had more life in my little finger than half the fellow-commoners&mdash;genteel,
      spindle-shanked striplings, who might have passed for a collection of my
      grandfather&rsquo;s walking-canes&mdash;bad in their whole bodies. And I often
      think,&rdquo; continued Gawtrey, &ldquo;that health and spirits have a great deal to
      answer for! When we are young we so far resemble savages who are Nature&rsquo;s
      young people&mdash;that we attach prodigious value to physical advantages.
      My feats of strength and activity&mdash;the clods I thrashed&mdash;and the
      railings I leaped&mdash;and the boat-races I won&mdash;are they not
      written in the chronicle of St. John&rsquo;s? These achievements inspired me
      with an extravagant sense of my own superiority; I could not but despise
      the rich fellows whom I could have blown down with a sneeze. Nevertheless,
      there was an impassable barrier between me and them&mdash;a sizar was not
      a proper associate for the favourites of fortune! But there was one young
      man, a year younger myself, of high birth, and the heir to considerable
      wealth, who did not regard me with the same supercilious insolence as the
      rest; his very rank, perhaps, made him indifferent to the little
      conventional formalities which influence persons who cannot play at
      football with this round world; he was the wildest youngster in the
      university&mdash;lamp-breaker&mdash;tandem-driver&mdash;mob-fighter&mdash;a
      very devil in short&mdash;clever, but not in the reading line&mdash;small
      and slight, but brave as a lion. Congenial habits made us intimate, and I
      loved him like a brother&mdash;better than a brother&mdash;as a dog loves
      his master. In all our rows I covered him with my body. He had but to say
      to me, &lsquo;Leap into the water,&rsquo; and I would not have stopped to pull off my
      coat. In short, I loved him as a proud man loves one who stands betwixt
      him and contempt,&mdash;as an affectionate man loves one who stands
      between him and solitude. To cut short a long story: my friend, one dark
      night, committed an outrage against discipline, of the most unpardonable
      character. There was a sanctimonious, grave old fellow of the College,
      crawling home from a tea-party; my friend and another of his set seized,
      blindfolded, and handcuffed this poor wretch, carried him, vi et armis,
      back to the house of an old maid whom he had been courting for the last
      ten years, fastened his pigtail (he wore a long one) to the knocker, and
      so left him. You may imagine the infernal hubbub which his attempts to
      extricate himself caused in the whole street; the old maid&rsquo;s old
      maidservant, after emptying on his head all the vessels of wrath she could
      lay her hand to, screamed, &lsquo;Rape and murder!&rsquo; The proctor and his
      bull-dogs came up, released the prisoner, and gave chase to the
      delinquents, who had incautiously remained near to enjoy the sport. The
      night was dark and they reached the College in safety, but they had been
      tracked to the gates. For this offence I was expelled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you were not concerned in it?&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I was suspected and accused. I could have got off by betraying
      the true culprits, but my friend&rsquo;s father was in public life&mdash;a
      stern, haughty old statesman; my friend was mortally afraid of him&mdash;the
      only person he was afraid of. If I had too much insisted on my innocence,
      I might have set inquiry on the right track. In fine, I was happy to prove
      my friendship for him. He shook me most tenderly by the hand on parting,
      and promised never to forget my generous devotion. I went home in
      disgrace: I need not tell you what my father said to me: I do not think he
      ever loved me from that hour. Shortly after this my uncle, George Gawtrey,
      the captain, returned from abroad; he took a great fancy to me, and I left
      my father&rsquo;s house (which had grown insufferable) to live with him. He had
      been a very handsome man&mdash;a gay spendthrift; he had got through his
      fortune, and now lived on his wits&mdash;he was a professed gambler. His
      easy temper, his lively humour, fascinated me; he knew the world well;
      and, like all gamblers, was generous when the dice were lucky,&mdash;which,
      to tell you the truth, they generally were, with a man who had no
      scruples. Though his practices were a little suspected, they had never
      been discovered. We lived in an elegant apartment, mixed familiarly with
      men of various ranks, and enjoyed life extremely. I brushed off my college
      rust, and conceived a taste for expense: I knew not why it was, but in my
      new existence every one was kind to me; and I had spirits that made me
      welcome everywhere. I was a scamp&mdash;but a frolicsome scamp&mdash;and
      that is always a popular character. As yet I was not dishonest, but saw
      dishonesty round me, and it seemed a very pleasant, jolly mode of making
      money; and now I again fell into contact with the young heir. My college
      friend was as wild in London as he had been at Cambridge; but the
      boy-ruffian, though not then twenty years of age, had grown into the
      man-villain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Gawtrey paused, and frowned darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had great natural parts, this young man&mdash;much wit, readiness, and
      cunning, and he became very intimate with my uncle. He learned of him how
      to play the dice, and a pack the cards&mdash;he paid him L1,000. for the
      knowledge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! a cheat? You said he was rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father was very rich, and he had a liberal allowance, but he was very
      extravagant; and rich men love gain as well as poor men do! He had no
      excuse but the grand excuse of all vice&mdash;SELFISHNESS. Young as he was
      he became the fashion, and he fattened upon the plunder of his equals, who
      desired the honour of his acquaintance. Now, I had seen my uncle cheat,
      but I had never imitated his example; when the man of fashion cheated, and
      made a jest of his earnings and my scruples&mdash;when I saw him courted,
      flattered, honoured, and his acts unsuspected, because his connections
      embraced half the peerage, the temptation grew strong, but I still
      resisted it. However, my father always said I was born to be a
      good-for-nothing, and I could not escape my destiny. And now I suddenly
      fell in love&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what that is yet&mdash;so much the
      better for you. The girl was beautiful, and I thought she loved me&mdash;perhaps
      she did&mdash;but I was too poor, so her friends said, for marriage. We
      courted, as the saying is, in the meanwhile. It was my love for her, my
      wish to deserve her, that made me iron against my friend&rsquo;s example. I was
      fool enough to speak to him of Mary&mdash;to present him to her&mdash;this
      ended in her seduction.&rdquo; (Again Gawtrey paused, and breathed hard.) &ldquo;I
      discovered the treachery&mdash;I called out the seducer&mdash;he sneered,
      and refused to fight the low-born adventurer. I struck him to the earth&mdash;and
      then we fought. I was satisfied by a ball through my side! but he,&rdquo; added
      Gawtrey, rubbing his hands, and with a vindictive chuckle,&mdash;&ldquo;He was a
      cripple for life! When I recovered I found that my foe, whose sick-chamber
      was crowded with friends and comforters, had taken advantage of my illness
      to ruin my reputation. He, the swindler, accused me of his own crime: the
      equivocal character of my uncle confirmed the charge. Him, his own
      high-born pupil was enabled to unmask, and his disgrace was visited on me.
      I left my bed to find my uncle (all disguise over) an avowed partner in a
      hell, and myself blasted alike in name, love, past, and future. And then,
      Philip&mdash;then I commenced that career which I have trodden since&mdash;the
      prince of good-fellows and good-for-nothings, with ten thousand aliases,
      and as many strings to my bow. Society cast me off when I was innocent.
      Egad, I have had my revenge on society since!&mdash;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laugh of this man had in it a moral infection. There was a sort of
      glorying in its deep tone; it was not the hollow hysteric of shame and
      despair&mdash;it spoke a sanguine joyousness! William Gawtrey was a man
      whose animal constitution had led him to take animal pleasure in all
      things: he had enjoyed the poisons he had lived on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father&mdash;surely your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; interrupted Gawtrey, &ldquo;refused me the money (but a small sum)
      that, once struck with the strong impulse of a sincere penitence, I begged
      of him, to enable me to get an honest living in a humble trade. His
      refusal soured the penitence&mdash;it gave me an excuse for my career and
      conscience grapples to an excuse as a drowning wretch to a straw. And yet
      this hard father&mdash;this cautious, moral, money-loving man, three
      months afterwards, suffered a rogue&mdash;almost a stranger&mdash;to decoy
      him into a speculation that promised to bring him fifty per cent. He
      invested in the traffic of usury what had sufficed to save a hundred such
      as I am from perdition, and he lost it all. It was nearly his whole
      fortune; but he lives and has his luxuries still: he cannot speculate, but
      he can save: he cared not if I starved, for he finds an hourly happiness
      in starving himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your friend,&rdquo; said Philip, after a pause in which his young
      sympathies went dangerously with the excuses for his benefactor; &ldquo;what has
      become of him, and the poor girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend became a great man; he succeeded to his father&rsquo;s peerage&mdash;a
      very ancient one&mdash;and to a splendid income. He is living still. Well,
      you shall hear about the poor girl! We are told of victims of seduction
      dying in a workhouse or on a dunghill, penitent, broken-hearted, and
      uncommonly ragged and sentimental. It may be a frequent case, but it is
      not the worst. It is worse, I think, when the fair, penitent, innocent,
      credulous dupe becomes in her turn the deceiver&mdash;when she catches
      vice from the breath upon which she has hung&mdash;when she ripens, and
      mellows, and rots away into painted, blazing, staring, wholesale harlotry&mdash;when,
      in her turn, she ruins warm youth with false smiles and long bills&mdash;and
      when worse&mdash;worse than all&mdash;when she has children, daughters
      perhaps, brought up to the same trade, cooped, plumper, for some hoary
      lecher, without a heart in their bosoms, unless a balance for weighing
      money may be called a heart. Mary became this; and I wish to Heaven she
      had rather died in an hospital! Her lover polluted her soul as well as her
      beauty: he found her another lover when he was tired of her. When she was
      at the age of thirty-six I met her in Paris, with a daughter of sixteen. I
      was then flush with money, frequenting salons, and playing the part of a
      fine gentleman. She did not know me at first; and she sought my
      acquaintance. For you must know, my young friend,&rdquo; said Gawtrey, abruptly
      breaking off the thread of his narrative, &ldquo;that I am not altogether the
      low dog you might suppose in seeing me here. At Paris&mdash;ah! you don&rsquo;t
      know Paris&mdash;there is a glorious ferment in society in which the dregs
      are often uppermost! I came here at the Peace, and here have I resided the
      greater part of each year ever since. The vast masses of energy and life,
      broken up by the great thaw of the Imperial system, floating along the
      tide, are terrible icebergs for the vessel of the state. Some think
      Napoleonism over&mdash;its effects are only begun. Society is shattered
      from one end to the other, and I laugh at the little rivets by which they
      think to keep it together.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [This passage was written at a period when the dynasty of Louis
   Philippe seemed the most assured, and Napoleonism was indeed
   considered extinct.]
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to return. Paris, I say, is the atmosphere for adventurers&mdash;new
      faces and new men are so common here that they excite no impertinent
      inquiry, it is so usual to see fortunes made in a day and spent in a
      month; except in certain circles, there is no walking round a man&rsquo;s
      character to spy out where it wants piercing! Some lean Greek poet put
      lead in his pockets to prevent being blown away;&mdash;put gold in your
      pockets, and at Paris you may defy the sharpest wind in the world,&mdash;yea,
      even the breath of that old AEolus&mdash;Scandal! Well, then, I had money&mdash;no
      matter how I came by it&mdash;and health, and gaiety; and I was well
      received in the coteries that exist in all capitals, but mostly in France,
      where pleasure is the cement that joins many discordant atoms. Here, I
      say, I met Mary and her daughter, by my old friend&mdash;the daughter,
      still innocent, but, sacra! in what an element of vice! We knew each
      other&rsquo;s secrets, Mary and I, and kept them: she thought me a greater knave
      than I was, and she intrusted to me her intention of selling her child to
      a rich English marquis. On the other hand, the poor girl confided to me
      her horror of the scenes she witnessed and the snares that surrounded her.
      What do you think preserved her pure from all danger? Bah! you will never
      guess! It was partly because, if example corrupts, it as often deters, but
      principally because she loved. A girl who loves one man purely has about
      her an amulet which defies the advances of the profligate. There was a
      handsome young Italian, an artist, who frequented the house&mdash;he was
      the man. I had to choose, then, between mother and daughter: I chose the
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip seized hold of Gawtrey&rsquo;s hand, grasped it warmly, and the
      good-for-nothing continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, that I loved that girl as well as I had ever loved the
      mother, though in another way; she was what I fancied the mother to be;
      still more fair, more graceful, more winning, with a heart as full of love
      as her mother&rsquo;s had been of vanity. I loved that child as if she had been
      my own daughter. I induced her to leave her mother&rsquo;s house&mdash;I
      secreted her&mdash;I saw her married to the man she loved&mdash;I gave her
      away, and saw no more of her for several months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I spent them in prison! The young people could not live upon air;
      I gave them what I had, and in order to do more I did something which
      displeased the police; I narrowly escaped that time; but I am popular&mdash;very
      popular, and with plenty of witnesses, not over-scrupulous, I got off!
      When I was released, I would not go to see them, for my clothes were
      ragged: the police still watched me, and I would not do them harm in the
      world! Ay, poor wretches! they struggled so hard: he could got very little
      by his art, though, I believe, he was a cleverish fellow at it, and the
      money I had given them could not last for ever. They lived near the Champs
      Elysees, and at night I used to steal out and look at them through the
      window. They seemed so happy, and so handsome, and so good; but he looked
      sickly, and I saw that, like all Italians, he languished for his own warm
      climate. But man is born to act as well as to contemplate,&rdquo; pursued
      Gawtrey, changing his tone into the allegro; &ldquo;and I was soon driven into
      my old ways, though in a lower line. I went to London, just to give my
      reputation an airing, and when I returned, pretty flush again, the poor
      Italian was dead, and Fanny was a widow, with one boy, and enceinte with a
      second child. So then I sought her again, for her mother had found her
      out, and was at her with her devilish kindness; but Heaven was merciful,
      and took her away from both of us: she died in giving birth to a girl, and
      her last words were uttered to me, imploring me&mdash;the adventurer&mdash;the
      charlatan&mdash;the good-for-nothing&mdash;to keep her child from the
      clutches of her own mother. Well, sir, I did what I could for both the
      children; but the boy was consumptive, like his father, and sleeps at
      Pere-la-Chaise. The girl is here&mdash;you shall see her some day. Poor
      Fanny! if ever the devil will let me, I shall reform for her sake.
      Meanwhile, for her sake I must get grist for the mill. My story is
      concluded, for I need not tell you all of my pranks&mdash;of all the parts
      I have played in life. I have never been a murderer, or a burglar, or a
      highway robber, or what the law calls a thief. I can only say, as I said
      before, I have lived upon my wits, and they have been a tolerable capital
      on the whole. I have been an actor, a money-lender, a physician, a
      professor of animal magnetism (that was lucrative till it went out of
      fashion, perhaps it will come in again); I have been a lawyer, a
      house-agent, a dealer in curiosities and china; I have kept a hotel; I
      have set up a weekly newspaper; I have seen almost every city in Europe,
      and made acquaintance with some of its gaols; but a man who has plenty of
      brains generally falls on his legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your father?&rdquo; said Philip; and here he spoke to Gawtrey of the
      conversation he had overheard in the churchyard, but on which a scruple of
      natural delicacy had hitherto kept him silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said his host, while a slight blush rose to his cheeks, &ldquo;I
      will tell you, that though to my father&rsquo;s sternness and avarice I
      attribute many of my faults, I yet always had a sort of love for him; and
      when in London I accidentally heard that he was growing blind, and living
      with an artful old jade of a housekeeper, who might send him to rest with
      a dose of magnesia the night after she had coaxed him to make a will in
      her favour. I sought him out&mdash;and&mdash;but you say you heard what
      passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I heard him also call you by name, when it was too late, and I
      saw the tears on his cheeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? Will you swear to that?&rdquo; exclaimed Gawtrey, with vehemence:
      then, shading his brow with his band, he fell into a reverie that lasted
      some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything happen to me, Philip,&rdquo; he said, abruptly, &ldquo;perhaps he may yet
      be a father to poor Fanny; and if he takes to her, she will repay him for
      whatever pain I may, perhaps, have cost him. Stop! now I think of it, I
      will write down his address for you&mdash;never forget it&mdash;there! It
      is time to go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey&rsquo;s tale made a deep impression on Philip. He was too young, too
      inexperienced, too much borne away by the passion of the narrator, to see
      that Gawtrey had less cause to blame Fate than himself. True, he had been
      unjustly implicated in the disgrace of an unworthy uncle, but he had lived
      with that uncle, though he knew him to be a common cheat; true, he had
      been betrayed by a friend, but he had before known that friend to be a man
      without principle or honour. But what wonder that an ardent boy saw
      nothing of this&mdash;saw only the good heart that had saved a poor girl
      from vice, and sighed to relieve a harsh and avaricious parent? Even the
      hints that Gawtrey unawares let fall of practices scarcely covered by the
      jovial phrase of &ldquo;a great schoolboy&rsquo;s scrapes,&rdquo; either escaped the notice
      of Philip, or were charitably construed by him, in the compassion and the
      ignorance of a young, hasty, and grateful heart.

     With divers corners!&rdquo;&mdash;ROWLEY.
</pre>
    <p>
      I have said that Gawtrey&rsquo;s tale made a deep impression on Philip;&mdash;that
      impression was increased by subsequent conversations, more frank even than
      their talk had hitherto been. There was certainly about this man a fatal
      charm which concealed his vices. It arose, perhaps, from the perfect
      combinations of his physical frame&mdash;from a health which made his
      spirits buoyant and hearty under all circumstances&mdash;and a blood so
      fresh, so sanguine, that it could not fail to keep the pores of the heart
      open. But he was not the less&mdash;for all his kindly impulses and
      generous feelings, and despite the manner in which, naturally anxious to
      make the least unfavourable portrait of himself to Philip, he softened and
      glossed over the practices of his life&mdash;a thorough and complete
      rogue, a dangerous, desperate, reckless daredevil. It was easy to see when
      anything crossed him, by the cloud on his shaggy brow, by the swelling of
      the veins on the forehead, by the dilation of the broad nostril, that he
      was one to cut his way through every obstacle to an end,&mdash;choleric,
      impetuous, fierce, determined. Such, indeed, were the qualities that made
      him respected among his associates, as his more bland and humorous ones
      made him beloved. He was, in fact, the incarnation of that great spirit
      which the laws of the world raise up against the world, and by which the
      world&rsquo;s injustice on a large scale is awfully chastised; on a small scale,
      merely nibbled at and harassed, as the rat that gnaws the hoof of the
      elephant:&mdash;the spirit which, on a vast theatre, rises up, gigantic
      and sublime, in the heroes of war and revolution&mdash;in Mirabeaus,
      Marats, Napoleons: on a minor stage, it shows itself in demagogues,
      fanatical philosophers, and mob-writers; and on the forbidden boards,
      before whose reeking lamps outcasts sit, at once audience and actors, it
      never produced a knave more consummate in his part, or carrying it off
      with more buskined dignity, than William Gawtrey. I call him by his
      aboriginal name; as for his other appellations, Bacchus himself had not so
      many!
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, a lady, richly dressed, was ushered by Mr. Birnie into the bureau
      of Mr. Love, alias Gawtrey. Philip was seated by the window, reading, for
      the first time, the Candide,&mdash;that work, next to Rasselas, the most
      hopeless and gloomy of the sports of genius with mankind. The lady seemed
      rather embarrassed when she perceived Mr. Love was not alone. She drew
      back, and, drawing her veil still more closely round her, said, in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, I would wish a private conversation.&rdquo; Philip rose to withdraw,
      when the lady, observing him with eyes whose lustre shone through the
      veil, said gently: &ldquo;But perhaps the young gentleman is discreet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not discreet, he is discretion!&mdash;my adopted son. You may
      confide in him&mdash;upon my honour you may, madam!&rdquo; and Mr. Love placed
      his hand on his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very young,&rdquo; said the lady, in a tone of involuntary compassion,
      as, with a very white hand, she unclasped the buckle of her cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can the better understand the curse of celibacy,&rdquo; returned Mr. Love,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady lifted part of her veil, and discovered a handsome mouth, and a
      set of small, white teeth; for she, too, smiled, though gravely, as she
      turned to Morton, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem, sir, more fitted to be a votary of the temple than one of its
      officers. However, Monsieur Love, let there be no mistake between us; I do
      not come here to form a marriage, but to prevent one. I understand that
      Monsieur the Vicomte de Vaudemont has called into request your services. I
      am one of the Vicomte&rsquo;s family; we are all anxious that he should not
      contract an engagement of the strange and, pardon me, unbecoming
      character, which must stamp a union formed at a public office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Love, with dignity, &ldquo;that we have
      contributed to the very first&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; interrupted the lady, with much impatience, &ldquo;spare me a eulogy
      on your establishment: I have no doubt it is very respectable; and for
      grisettes and epiciers may do extremely well. But the Vicomte is a man of
      birth and connections. In a word, what he contemplates is preposterous. I
      know not what fee Monsieur Love expects; but if he contrive to amuse
      Monsieur de Vaudemont, and to frustrate every connection he proposes to
      form, that fee, whatever it may be, shall be doubled. Do you understand
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, madam; yet it is not your offer that will bias me, but the
      desire to oblige so charming a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is agreed, then?&rdquo; said the lady, carelessly; and as she spoke she
      again glanced at Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If madame will call again, I will inform her of my plans,&rdquo; said Mr. Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will call again. Good morning!&rdquo; As she rose and passed Philip, she
      wholly put aside her veil, and looked at him with a gaze entirely free
      from coquetry, but curious, searching, and perhaps admiring&mdash;the look
      that an artist may give to a picture that seems of more value than the
      place where he finds it would seem to indicate. The countenance of the
      lady herself was fair and noble, and Philip felt a strange thrill at his
      heart as, with a slight inclination of her head, she turned from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Gawtrey, laughing, &ldquo;this is not the first time I have been paid
      by relations to break off the marriages I had formed. Egad! if one could
      open a bureau to make married people single, one would soon be a Croesus!
      Well, then, this decides me to complete the union between Monsieur
      Goupille and Mademoiselle de Courval. I had balanced a little hitherto
      between the epicier and the Vicomte. Now I will conclude matters. Do you
      know, Phil, I think you have made a conquest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Philip, colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      In effect, that very evening Mr. Love saw both the epicier and Adele, and
      fixed the marriage-day. As Monsieur Goupille was a person of great
      distinction in the Faubourg, this wedding was one upon which Mr. Love
      congratulated himself greatly; and he cheerfully accepted an invitation
      for himself and his partners to honour the noces with their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A night or two before the day fixed for the marriage of Monsieur Goupille
      and the aristocratic Adele, when Mr. Birnie had retired, Gawtrey made his
      usual preparations for enjoying himself. But this time the cigar and the
      punch seemed to fail of their effect. Gawtrey remained moody and silent;
      and Morton was thinking of the bright eyes of the lady who was so much
      interested against the amours of the Vicomte de Vaudemont.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Gawtrey broke silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I told you of my little protege; I have been
      buying toys for her this morning; she is a beautiful creature; to-morrow
      is her birthday&mdash;she will then be six years old. But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
       here Gawtrey sighed&mdash;&ldquo;I fear she is not all right here,&rdquo; and he
      touched his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like much to see her,&rdquo; said Philip, not noticing the latter
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you shall&mdash;you shall come with me to-morrow. Heigho! I should
      not like to die, for her sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does her wretched relation attempt to regain her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her relation! No; she is no more&mdash;she died about two years since!
      Poor Mary! I&mdash;well, this is folly. But Fanny is at present in a
      convent; they are all kind to her, but then I pay well; if I were dead,
      and the pay stopped,&mdash;again I ask, what would become of her, unless,
      as I before said, my father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are making a fortune now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this lasts&mdash;yes; but I live in fear&mdash;the police of this
      cursed city are lynx-eyed; however, that is the bright side of the
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not have the child with you, since you love her so much? She would be
      a great comfort to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this a place for a child&mdash;a girl?&rdquo; said Gawtrey, stamping his
      foot impatiently. &ldquo;I should go mad if I saw that villainous deadman&rsquo;s eye
      bent upon her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of Birnie. How can you endure him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are my age you will know why we endure what we dread&mdash;why
      we make friends of those who else would be most horrible foes: no, no&mdash;nothing
      can deliver me of this man but Death. And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; added Gawtrey,
      turning pale, &ldquo;I cannot murder a man who eats my bread. There are stronger
      ties, my lad, than affection, that bind men, like galley-slaves, together.
      He who can hang you puts the halter round your neck and leads you by it
      like a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder came over the young listener. And what dark secrets, known only
      to those two, had bound, to a man seemingly his subordinate and tool, the
      strong will and resolute temper of William Gawtrey?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, begone, dull care!&rdquo; exclaimed Gawtrey, rousing himself. &ldquo;And, after
      all, Birnie is a useful fellow, and dare no more turn against me than I
      against him! Why don&rsquo;t you drink more?
    </p>

   &ldquo;Oh! have you e&rsquo;er heard of the famed Captain Wattle?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and Gawtrey broke out into a loud Bacchanalian hymn, in which Philip could
      find no mirth, and from which the songster suddenly paused to exclaim:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you say nothing about Fanny to Birnie; my secrets with him are not
      of that nature. He could not hurt her, poor lamb! it is true&mdash;at
      least, as far as I can foresee. But one can never feel too sure of one&rsquo;s
      lamb, if one once introduces it to the butcher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day being Sunday, the bureau was closed, and Philip and Gawtrey
      repaired to the convent. It was a dismal-looking place as to the exterior;
      but, within, there was a large garden, well kept, and, notwithstanding the
      winter, it seemed fair and refreshing, compared with the polluted streets.
      The window of the room into which they were shown looked upon the green
      sward, with walls covered with ivy at the farther end. And Philip&rsquo;s own
      childhood came back to him as he gazed on the quiet of the lonely place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened&mdash;an infant voice was heard, a voice of glee&mdash;of
      rapture; and a child, light and beautiful as a fairy, bounded to Gawtrey&rsquo;s
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nestling there, she kissed his face, his hands, his clothes, with a
      passion that did not seem to belong to her age, laughing and sobbing
      almost at a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his part, Gawtrey appeared equally affected: he stroked down her hair
      with his huge hand, calling her all manner of pet names, in a tremulous
      voice that vainly struggled to be gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he took the toys he had brought with him from his capacious
      pockets, and strewing them on the floor, fairly stretched his vast bulk
      along; while the child tumbled over him, sometimes grasping at the toys,
      and then again returning to his bosom, and laying her head there, looked
      up quietly into his eyes, as if the joy were too much for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton, unheeded by both, stood by with folded arms. He thought of his
      lost and ungrateful brother, and muttered to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool! when she is older, she will forsake him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny betrayed in her face the Italian origin of her father. She had that
      exceeding richness of complexion which, though not common even in Italy,
      is only to be found in the daughters of that land, and which harmonised
      well with the purple lustre of her hair, and the full, clear iris of the
      dark eyes. Never were parted cherries brighter than her dewy lips; and the
      colour of the open neck and the rounded arms was of a whiteness still more
      dazzling, from the darkness of the hair and the carnation of the glowing
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Fanny started from Gawtrey&rsquo;s arms, and running up to Morton,
      gazed at him wistfully, and said, in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? Do you come from the moon? I think you do.&rdquo; Then, stopping
      abruptly, she broke into a verse of a nursery-song, which she chaunted
      with a low, listless tone, as if she were not conscious of the sense. As
      she thus sang, Morton, looking at her, felt a strange and painful doubt
      seize him. The child&rsquo;s eyes, though soft, were so vacant in their gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why do I come from the moon?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you look sad and cross. I don&rsquo;t like you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like the
      moon; it gives me a pain here!&rdquo; and she put her hand to her temples. &ldquo;Have
      you got anything for Fanny&mdash;poor, poor Fanny?&rdquo; and, dwelling on the
      epithet, she shook her head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rich, Fanny, with all those toys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I? Everybody calls me poor Fanny&mdash;everybody but papa;&rdquo; and she
      ran again to Gawtrey, and laid her head on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She calls me papa!&rdquo; said Gawtrey, kissing her; &ldquo;you hear it? Bless her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never kiss any one but Fanny&mdash;you have no other little
      girl?&rdquo; said the child, earnestly, and with a look less vacant than that
      which had saddened Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No other&mdash;no&mdash;nothing under heaven, and perhaps above it, but
      you!&rdquo; and he clasped her in his arms. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, after a pause&mdash;&ldquo;but
      mind me, Fanny, you must like this gentleman. He will be always good to
      you: and he had a little brother whom he was as fond of as I am of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t like him&mdash;I won&rsquo;t like anybody but you and my sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister!&mdash;who is your sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child&rsquo;s face relapsed into an expression almost of idiotcy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;I never saw her. I hear her sometimes, but I don&rsquo;t understand
      what she says.&mdash;Hush! come here!&rdquo; and she stole to the window on
      tiptoe. Gawtrey followed and looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear her, now?&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;What does she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the girl spoke, some bird among the evergreens uttered a shrill,
      plaintive cry, rather than song&mdash;a sound which the thrush
      occasionally makes in the winter, and which seems to express something of
      fear, and pain, and impatience. &ldquo;What does she say?&mdash;can you tell
      me?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! that is a bird; why do you call it your sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&mdash;because it is&mdash;because it&mdash;because&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know&mdash;is it not in pain?&mdash;do something for it, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey glanced at Morton, whose face betokened his deep pity, and
      creeping up to him, whispered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she is really touched here? No, no,&mdash;she will outgrow
      it&mdash;I am sure she will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny by this time had again seated herself in the middle of the floor,
      and arranged her toys, but without seeming to take pleasure in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Gawtrey was obliged to depart. The lay sister, who had charge of
      Fanny, was summoned into the parlour; and then the child&rsquo;s manner entirely
      changed; her face grew purple&mdash;she sobbed with as much anger as
      grief. &ldquo;She would not leave papa&mdash;she would not go&mdash;that she
      would not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is always so,&rdquo; whispered Gawtrey to Morton, in an abashed and
      apologetic voice. &ldquo;It is so difficult to get away from her. Just go and
      talk with her while I steal out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton went to her, as she struggled with the patient good-natured sister,
      and began to soothe and caress her, till she turned on him her large humid
      eyes, and said, mournfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tu es mechant, tu. Poor Fanny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this pretty doll&mdash;&rdquo; began the sister. The child looked at it
      joylessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And papa is going to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever Monsieur goes,&rdquo; whispered the nun, &ldquo;she always says that he is
      dead, and cries herself quietly to sleep; when Monsieur returns, she says
      he is come to life again. Some one, I suppose, once talked to her about
      death; and she thinks when she loses sight of any one, that that is
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said Morton, with a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child looked up, smiled, stroked his cheek with her little hand, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&mdash;Yes! poor Fanny! Ah, he is going&mdash;see!&mdash;let me
      go too&mdash;tu es mechant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Morton, detaining her gently, &ldquo;do you know that you give him
      pain?&mdash;you make him cry by showing pain yourself. Don&rsquo;t make him so
      sad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child seemed struck, hung down her head for a moment, as if in
      thought, and then, jumping from Morton&rsquo;s lap, ran to Gawtrey, put up her
      pouting lips, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One kiss more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey kissed her, and turned away his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny is a good girl!&rdquo; and Fanny, as she spoke, went back to Morton, and
      put her little fingers into her eyes, as if either to shut out Gawtrey&rsquo;s
      retreat from her sight, or to press back her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me the doll now, sister Marie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton smiled and sighed, placed the child, who struggled no more, in the
      nun&rsquo;s arms, and left the room; but as he closed the door he looked back,
      and saw that Fanny had escaped from the sister, thrown herself on the
      floor, and was crying, but not loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she not a little darling?&rdquo; said Gawtrey, as they gained the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is, indeed, a most beautiful child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will love her if I leave her penniless,&rdquo; said Gawtrey, abruptly.
      &ldquo;It was your love for your mother and your brother that made me like you
      from the first. Ay,&rdquo; continued Gawtrey, in a tone of great earnestness,
      &ldquo;ay, and whatever may happen to me, I will strive and keep you, my poor
      lad, harmless; and what is better, innocent even of such matters as sit
      light enough on my own well-seasoned conscience. In turn, if ever you have
      the power, be good to her,&mdash;yes, be good to her! and I won&rsquo;t say a
      harsh word to you if ever you like to turn king&rsquo;s evidence against
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawtrey!&rdquo; said Morton, reproachfully, and almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&mdash;such things are! But tell me honestly, do you think she is
      very strange&mdash;very deficient?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen enough of her to judge,&rdquo; answered Morton, evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is so changeful,&rdquo; persisted Gawtrey. &ldquo;Sometimes you would say that
      she was above her age, she comes out with such thoughtful, clever things;
      then, the next moment, she throws me into despair. These nuns are very
      skilful in education&mdash;at least they are said to be so. The doctors
      give me hope, too. You see, her poor mother was very unhappy at the time
      of her birth&mdash;delirious, indeed: that may account for it. I often
      fancy that it is the constant excitement which her state occasions me that
      makes me love her so much. You see she is one who can never shift for
      herself. I must get money for her; I have left a little already with the
      superior, and I would not touch it to save myself from famine! If she has
      money people will be kind enough to her. And then,&rdquo; continued Gawtrey,
      &ldquo;you must perceive that she loves nothing in the world but me&mdash;me,
      whom nobody else loves! Well&mdash;well, now to the shop again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On returning home the bonne informed them that a lady had called, and
      asked both for Monsieur Love and the young gentleman, and seemed much
      chagrined at missing both. By the description, Morton guessed she was the
      fair incognita, and felt disappointed at having lost the interview.

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The cursed carle was at his wonted trade,
     Still tempting heedless men into his snare,
     In witching wise, as I before have said;
     But when he saw, in goodly gear array&rsquo;d,
     The grave majestic knight approaching nigh,
     His countenance fell.&rdquo;&mdash;THOMSON, Castle of Indolence.
</pre>
    <p>
      The morning rose that was to unite Monsieur Goupille with Mademoiselle
      Adele de Courval. The ceremony was performed, and bride and bridegroom
      went through that trying ordeal with becoming gravity. Only the elegant
      Adele seemed more unaffectedly agitated than Mr. Love could well account
      for; she was very nervous in church, and more often turned her eyes to the
      door than to the altar. Perhaps she wanted to run away; but it was either
      too late or too early for the proceeding. The rite performed, the happy
      pair and their friends adjourned to the Cadran Bleu, that restaurant so
      celebrated in the festivities of the good citizens of Paris. Here Mr. Love
      had ordered, at the epicier&rsquo;s expense, a most tasteful entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacre! but you have not played the economist, Monsieur Lofe,&rdquo; said
      Monsieur Goupille, rather querulously, as he glanced at the long room
      adorned with artificial flowers, and the table a cingitante couverts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; replied Mr. Love, &ldquo;you can retrench afterwards. Think of the
      fortune she brought you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pretty sum, certainly,&rdquo; said Monsieur Goupille, &ldquo;and the notary
      is perfectly satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a marriage in Paris that does me more credit,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Love; and he marched off to receive the compliments and congratulations
      that awaited him among such of the guests as were aware of his good
      offices. The Vicomte de Vaudemont was of course not present. He had not
      been near Mr. Love since Adele had accepted the epicier. But Madame
      Beavor, in a white bonnet lined with lilac, was hanging, sentimentally, on
      the arm of the Pole, who looked very grand with his white favour; and Mr.
      Higgins had been introduced, by Mr. Love, to a little dark Creole, who
      wore paste diamonds, and had very languishing eyes; so that Mr. Love&rsquo;s
      heart might well swell with satisfaction at the prospect of the various
      blisses to come, which might owe their origin to his benevolence. In fact,
      that archpriest of the Temple of Hymen was never more great than he was
      that day; never did his establishment seem more solid, his reputation more
      popular, or his fortune more sure. He was the life of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banquet over, the revellers prepared for a dance. Monsieur Goupille,
      in tights, still tighter than he usually wore, and of a rich nankeen,
      quite new, with striped silk stockings, opened the ball with the lady of a
      rich patissier in the same Faubourg; Mr. Love took out the bride. The
      evening advanced; and after several other dances of ceremony, Monsieur
      Goupille conceived himself entitled to dedicate one to connubial
      affection. A country-dance was called, and the epicier claimed the fair
      hand of the gentle Adele. About this time, two persons not hitherto
      perceived had quietly entered the room, and, standing near the doorway,
      seemed examining the dancers, as if in search for some one. They bobbed
      their heads up and down, to and fro stopped&mdash;now stood on tiptoe. The
      one was a tall, large-whiskered, fair-haired man; the other, a little,
      thin, neatly-dressed person, who kept his hand on the arm of his
      companion, and whispered to him from time to time. The whiskered gentleman
      replied in a guttural tone, which proclaimed his origin to be German. The
      busy dancers did not perceive the strangers. The bystanders did, and a hum
      of curiosity circled round; who could they be?&mdash;who had invited them?&mdash;they
      were new faces in the Faubourg&mdash;perhaps relations to Adele?
    </p>
    <p>
      In high delight the fair bride was skipping down the middle, while
      Monsieur Goupille, wiping his forehead with care, admired her agility;
      when, to and behold! the whiskered gentleman I have described abruptly
      advanced from his companion, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La voila!&mdash;sacre tonnerre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that voice&mdash;at that apparition, the bride halted; so suddenly
      indeed, that she had not time to put down both feet, but remained with one
      high in the air, while the other sustained itself on the light fantastic
      toe. The company naturally imagined this to be an operatic flourish, which
      called for approbation. Monsieur Love, who was thundering down behind her,
      cried, &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; and as the well-grown gentleman had to make a sweep to
      avoid disturbing her equilibrium, he came full against the whiskered
      stranger, and sent him off as a bat sends a ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; cried Monsieur Goupille. &ldquo;Ma douce amie&mdash;she has fainted
      away!&rdquo; And, indeed, Adele had no sooner recovered her, balance, than she
      resigned it once more into the arms of the startled Pole, who was happily
      at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, the German stranger, who had saved himself from falling
      by coming with his full force upon the toes of Mr. Higgins, again advanced
      to the spot, and, rudely seizing the fair bride by the arm, exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sham if you please, madame&mdash;speak! What the devil have you done
      with the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; said Monsieur Goupille, drawing tip his cravat, &ldquo;this is
      very extraordinary conduct! What have you got to say to this lady&rsquo;s money?&mdash;it
      is my money now, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! it is, is it? We&rsquo;ll soon see that. Approchez donc, Monsieur Favart,
      faites votre devoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the small companion of the stranger slowly sauntered to the
      spot, while at the sound of his name and the tread of his step, the throng
      gave way to the right and left. For Monsieur Favart was one of the most
      renowned chiefs of the great Parisian police&mdash;a man worthy to be the
      contemporary of the illustrious Vidocq.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calmez vous, messieurs; do not be alarmed, ladies,&rdquo; said this gentleman,
      in the mildest of all human voices; and certainly no oil dropped on the
      waters ever produced so tranquillising an effect as that small, feeble,
      gentle tenor. The Pole, in especial, who was holding the fair bride with
      both his arms, shook all over, and seemed about to let his burden
      gradually slide to the floor, when Monsieur Favart, looking at him with a
      benevolent smile, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, mon brave! c&rsquo;est toi. Restez donc. Restez, tenant toujours la dame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Pole, thus condemned, in the French idiom, &ldquo;always to hold the dame,&rdquo;
       mechanically raised the arms he had previously dejected, and the police
      officer, with an approving nod of the head, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon! ne bougez point,&mdash;c&rsquo;est ca!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Goupille, in equal surprise and indignation to see his better
      half thus consigned, without any care to his own marital feelings, to the
      arms of another, was about to snatch her from the Pole, when Monsieur
      Favart, touching him on the breast with his little finger, said, in the
      suavest manner,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon bourgeois, meddle not with what does not concern you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With what does not concern me!&rdquo; repeated Monsieur Goupille, drawing
      himself up to so great a stretch that he seemed pulling off his tights the
      wrong way. &ldquo;Explain yourself, if you please! This lady is my wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that again,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; cried the whiskered stranger, in most
      horrible French, and with a furious grimace, as he shook both his fists
      just under the nose of the epicier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it again, sir,&rdquo; said Monsieur Goupille, by no means daunted; &ldquo;and why
      should not I say it again? That lady is my wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&mdash;she is mine!&rdquo; cried the German; and bending down, he
      caught the fair Adele from the Pole with as little ceremony as if she had
      never had a great-grandfather a marquis, and giving her a shake that might
      have roused the dead, thundered out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak! Madame Bihl! Are you my wife or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monstre!&rdquo; murmured Adele, opening her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;you hear&mdash;she owns me!&rdquo; said the German, appealing to
      the company with a triumphant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&rsquo;est vrai!&rdquo; said the soft voice of the policeman. &ldquo;And now, pray don&rsquo;t
      let us disturb your amusements any longer. We have a fiacre at the door.
      Remove your lady, Monsieur Bihl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Lofe!&mdash;Monsieur Lofe!&rdquo; cried, or rather screeched the
      epicier, darting across the room, and seizing the chef by the tail of his
      coat, just as he was half way through the door, &ldquo;come back! Quelle
      mauvaise plaisanterie me faites-vous ici? Did you not tell me that lady
      was single? Am I married or not: Do I stand on my head or my heels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush-hush! mon bon bourgeois!&rdquo; whispered Mr. Love; &ldquo;all shall be
      explained to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this gentleman?&rdquo; asked Monsieur Favart, approaching Mr. Love, who,
      seeing himself in for it, suddenly jerked off the epicier, thrust his
      hands down into his breeches&rsquo; pockets, buried his chin in his cravat,
      elevated his eyebrows, screwed in his eyes, and puffed out his cheeks, so
      that the astonished Monsieur Goupille really thought himself bewitched,
      and literally did not recognise the face of the match-maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this gentleman?&rdquo; repeated the little officer, standing beside, or
      rather below, Mr. Love, and looking so diminutive by the contrast that you
      might have fancied that the Priest of Hymen had only to breathe to blow
      him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who should he be, monsieur?&rdquo; cried, with great pertness, Madame Rosalie
      Caumartin, coming to the relief, with the generosity of her sex.&mdash;&ldquo;This
      is Monsieur Lofe&mdash;Anglais celebre. What have you to say against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has got five hundred francs of mine!&rdquo; cried the epicier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman scanned Mr. Love, with great attention. &ldquo;So you are in Paris
      again?&mdash;Hein!&mdash;vous jouez toujours votre role!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma foi!&rdquo; said Mr. Love, boldly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what monsieur means;
      my character is well known&mdash;go and inquire it in London&mdash;ask the
      Secretary of Foreign Affairs what is said of me&mdash;inquire of my
      Ambassador&mdash;demand of my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Votre passeport, monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is at home. A gentleman does not carry his passport in his pocket when
      he goes to a ball!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will call and see it&mdash;au revoir! Take my advice and leave Paris; I
      think I have seen you somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I have never had the honour to marry monsieur!&rdquo; said Mr. Love, with a
      polite bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In return for his joke, the policeman gave Mr. Love one look&mdash;it was
      a quiet look, very quiet; but Mr. Love seemed uncommonly affected by it;
      he did not say another word, but found himself outside the house in a
      twinkling. Monsieur Favart turned round and saw the Pole making himself as
      small as possible behind the goodly proportions of Madame Beavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name does that gentleman go by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;vo&mdash;lofski, the heroic Pole,&rdquo; cried Madame Beavor, with
      sundry misgivings at the unexpected cowardice of so great a patriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hein! take care of yourselves, ladies. I have nothing against that person
      this time. But Monsieur Latour has served his apprenticeship at the
      galleys, and is no more a Pole than I am a Jew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this lady&rsquo;s fortune!&rdquo; cried Monsieur Groupille, pathetically; &ldquo;the
      settlements are all made&mdash;the notaries all paid. I am sure there must
      be some mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Bihl, who had by this time restored his lost Helen to her senses,
      stalked up to the epicier, dragging the lady along with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, there is no mistake! But, when I have got the money, if you like to
      have the lady you are welcome to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monstre!&rdquo; again muttered the fair Adele.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The long and the short of it,&rdquo; said Monsieur Favart, &ldquo;is that Monsieur
      Bihl is a brave garcon, and has been half over the world as a courier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A courier!&rdquo; exclaimed several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame was nursery-governess to an English milord. They married, and
      quarrelled&mdash;no harm in that, mes amis; nothing more common. Monsieur
      Bihl is a very faithful fellow; nursed his last master in an illness that
      ended fatally, because he travelled with his doctor. Milord left him a
      handsome legacy&mdash;he retired from service, and fell ill, perhaps from
      idleness or beer. Is not that the story, Monsieur Bihl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was always drunk&mdash;the wretch!&rdquo; sobbed Adele. &ldquo;That was to drown
      my domestic sorrows,&rdquo; said the German; &ldquo;and when I was sick in my bed,
      madame ran off with my money. Thanks to monsieur, I have found both, and I
      wish you a very good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dansez-vous toujours, mes amis,&rdquo; said the officer, bowing. And following
      Adele and her spouse, the little man left the room&mdash;where he had
      caused, in chests so broad and limbs so doughty, much the same
      consternation as that which some diminutive ferret occasions in a burrow
      of rabbits twice his size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton had outstayed Mr. Love. But he thought it unnecessary to linger
      long after that gentleman&rsquo;s departure; and, in the general hubbub that
      ensued, he crept out unperceived, and soon arrived at the bureau. He found
      Mr. Love and Mr. Birnie already engaged in packing up their effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;when did you leave?&rdquo; said Morton to Mr. Birnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the policeman enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why the deuce did not you tell us?&rdquo; said Gawtrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man for himself. Besides, Mr. Love was dancing,&rdquo; replied Mr.
      Birnie, with a dull glance of disdain. &ldquo;Philosophy,&rdquo; muttered Gawtrey,
      thrusting his dresscoat into his trunk; then, suddenly changing his voice,
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! it was a very good joke after all&mdash;own I did it well. Ecod!
      if he had not given me that look, I think I should have turned the tables
      on him. But those d&mdash;-d fellows learn of the mad doctors how to tame
      us. Faith, my heart went down to my shoes&mdash;yet I&rsquo;m no coward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, after all, he evidently did not know you,&rdquo; said Morton; &ldquo;and what
      has he to say against you? Your trade is a strange one, but not dishonest.
      Why give up as if&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; interrupted Gawtrey, &ldquo;whether the officer comes after
      us or not, our trade is ruined; that infernal Adele, with her fabulous
      grandmaman, has done for us. Goupille will blow the temple about our ears.
      No help for it&mdash;eh, Birnie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed, Philip: we&rsquo;ll call thee at daybreak, for we must make clear
      work before our neighbours open their shutters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reclined, but half undressed, on his bed in the little cabinet, Morton
      revolved the events of the evening. The thought that he should see no more
      of that white hand and that lovely mouth, which still haunted his
      recollection as appertaining to the incognita, greatly indisposed him
      towards the abrupt flight intended by Gawtrey, while (so much had his
      faith in that person depended upon respect for his confident daring, and
      so thoroughly fearless was Morton&rsquo;s own nature) he felt himself greatly
      shaken in his allegiance to the chief, by recollecting the effect produced
      on his valour by a single glance from the instrument of law. He had not
      yet lived long enough to be aware that men are sometimes the
      Representatives of Things; that what the scytale was to the Spartan hero,
      a sheriff&rsquo;s writ often is to a Waterloo medallist: that a Bow Street
      runner will enter the foulest den where Murder sits with his fellows, and
      pick out his prey with the beck of his forefinger. That, in short, the
      thing called LAW, once made tangible and present, rarely fails to palsy
      the fierce heart of the thing called CRIME. For Law is the symbol of all
      mankind reared against One Foe&mdash;the Man of Crime. Not yet aware of
      this truth, nor, indeed, in the least suspecting Gawtrey of worse offences
      than those of a charlatanic and equivocal profession, the young man mused
      over his protector&rsquo;s cowardice in disdain and wonder: till, wearied with
      conjectures, distrust, and shame at his own strange position of obligation
      to one whom he could not respect, he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he woke, he saw the grey light of dawn that streamed cheerlessly
      through his shutterless window, struggling with the faint ray of a candle
      that Gawtrey, shading with his hand, held over the sleeper. He started up,
      and, in the confusion of waking and the imperfect light by which he beheld
      the strong features of Gawtrey, half imagined it was a foe who stood
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, man,&rdquo; said Gawtrey, as Morton, in this belief, grasped his
      arm. &ldquo;You have a precious rough gripe of your own. Be quiet, will you? I
      have a word to say to you.&rdquo; Here Gawtrey, placing the candle on a chair,
      returned to the door and closed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you,&rdquo; he said in a whisper, &ldquo;I have nearly run through my circle of
      invention, and my wit, fertile as it is, can present to me little
      encouragement in the future. The eyes of this Favart once on me, every
      disguise and every double will not long avail. I dare not return to
      London: I am too well known in Brussels, Berlin, and Vienna&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interrupted Morton, raising himself on his arm, and fixing his dark
      eyes upon his host,&mdash;&ldquo;but you have told me again and again that you
      have committed no crime; why then be so fearful of discovery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; repeated Gawtrey, with a slight hesitation which he instantly
      overcame, &ldquo;why! have not you yourself learned that appearances have the
      effect of crimes?&mdash;were you not chased as a thief when I rescued you
      from your foe, the law?&mdash;are you not, though a boy in years, under an
      alias, and an exile from your own land? And how can you put these austere
      questions to me, who am growing grey in the endeavour to extract sunbeams
      from cucumbers&mdash;subsistence from poverty? I repeat that there are
      reasons why I must avoid, for the present, the great capitals. I must sink
      in life, and take to the provinces. Birnie is sanguine as ever; but he is
      a terrible sort of comforter! Enough of that. Now to yourself: our savings
      are less than you might expect; to be sure, Birnie has been treasurer, and
      I have laid by a little for Fanny, which I will rather starve than touch.
      There remain, however, 150 napoleons, and our effects, sold at a fourth
      their value, will fetch 150 more. Here is your share. I have compassion on
      you. I told you I would bear you harmless and innocent. Leave us while yet
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, then, to Morton that Gawtrey had divined his thoughts of shame
      and escape of the previous night; perhaps Gawtrey had: and such is the
      human heart, that, instead of welcoming the very release he had half
      contemplated, now that it was offered him, Philip shrank from it as a base
      desertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Gawtrey!&rdquo; said he, pushing back the canvas bag of gold held out to
      him, &ldquo;you shall not go over the world, and feel that the orphan you fed
      and fostered left you to starve with your money in his pocket. When you
      again assure me that you have committed no crime, you again remind me that
      gratitude has no right to be severe upon the shifts and errors of its
      benefactor. If you do not conform to society, what has society done for
      me? No! I will not forsake you in a reverse. Fortune has given you a fall.
      What, then, courage, and at her again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These last words were said so heartily and cheerfully as Morton sprang
      from the bed, that they inspirited Gawtrey, who had really desponded of
      his lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I cannot reject the only friend left me; and while I
      live&mdash;. But I will make no professions. Quick, then, our luggage is
      already gone, and I hear Birnie grunting the rogue&rsquo;s march of retreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton&rsquo;s toilet was soon completed, and the three associates bade adieu to
      the bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birnie, who was taciturn and impenetrable as ever, walked a little before
      as guide. They arrived, at length, at a serrurier&rsquo;s shop, placed in an
      alley near the Porte St. Denis. The serrurier himself, a tall, begrimed,
      blackbearded man, was taking the shutters from his shop as they
      approached. He and Birnie exchanged silent nods; and the former, leaving
      his work, conducted them up a very filthy flight of stairs to an attic,
      where a bed, two stools, one table, and an old walnut-tree bureau formed
      the sole articles of furniture. Gawtrey looked rather ruefully round the
      black, low, damp walls, and said in a crestfallen tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were better off at the Temple of Hymen. But get us a bottle of wine,
      some eggs, and a frying-pan. By Jove, I am a capital hand at an omelet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The serrurier nodded again, grinned, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest here,&rdquo; said Birnie, in his calm, passionless voice, that seemed to
      Morton, however, to assume an unwonted tone of command. &ldquo;I will go and
      make the best bargain I can for our furniture, buy fresh clothes, and
      engage our places for Tours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Tours?&rdquo; repeated Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there are some English there; one can live wherever there are
      English,&rdquo; said Gawtrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; grunted Birnie, drily, and, buttoning up his coat, he walked slowly
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon he returned with a bundle of clothes, which Gawtrey, who always
      regained his elasticity of spirit wherever there was fair play to his
      talents, examined with great attention, and many exclamations of &ldquo;Bon!&mdash;c&rsquo;est
      va.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done well with the Jew,&rdquo; said Birnie, drawing from his coat pocket
      two heavy bags. &ldquo;One hundred and eighty napoleons. We shall commence with
      a good capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my friend,&rdquo; said Gawtrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serrurier was then despatched to the best restaurant in the
      neighbourhood, and the three adventurers made a less Socratic dinner than
      might have been expected.

</pre>
    <p>
      The adventurers arrived at Tours, and established themselves there in a
      lodging, without any incident worth narrating by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Tours Morton had nothing to do but take his pleasure and enjoy himself.
      He passed for a young heir; Gawtrey for his tutor&mdash;a doctor in
      divinity; Birnie for his valet. The task of maintenance fell on Gawtrey,
      who hit off his character to a hair; larded his grave jokes with
      university scraps of Latin; looked big and well-fed; wore knee-breeches
      and a shovel hat; and played whist with the skill of a veteran vicar. By
      his science in that game he made, at first, enough; at least, to defray
      their weekly expenses. But, by degrees, the good people at Tours, who,
      under pretence of health, were there for economy, grew shy of so excellent
      a player; and though Gawtrey always swore solemnly that he played with the
      most scrupulous honour (an asseveration which Morton, at least, implicitly
      believed), and no proof to the contrary was ever detected, yet a
      first-rate card-player is always a suspicious character, unless the losing
      parties know exactly who he is. The market fell off, and Gawtrey at length
      thought it prudent to extend their travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Gawtrey, &ldquo;the world nowadays has grown so ostentatious that
      one cannot travel advantageously without a post-chariot and four horses.&rdquo;
       At length they found themselves at Milan, which at that time was one of
      the El Dorados for gamesters. Here, however, for want of introductions,
      Mr. Gawtrey found it difficult to get into society. The nobles, proud and
      rich, played high, but were circumspect in their company; the bourgeoisie,
      industrious and energetic, preserved much of the old Lombard shrewdness;
      there were no tables d&rsquo;hote and public reunions. Gawtrey saw his little
      capital daily diminishing, with the Alps at the rear and Poverty in the
      van. At length, always on the qui vive, he contrived to make acquaintance
      with a Scotch family of great respectability. He effected this by picking
      up a snuff-box which the Scotchman had dropped in taking out his
      handkerchief. This politeness paved the way to a conversation in which
      Gawtrey made himself so agreeable, and talked with such zest of the Modern
      Athens, and the tricks practised upon travellers, that he was presented to
      Mrs. Macgregor; cards were interchanged, and, as Mr. Gawtrey lived in
      tolerable style, the Macgregors pronounced him &ldquo;a vara genteel mon.&rdquo; Once
      in the house of a respectable person, Gawtrey contrived to turn himself
      round and round, till he burrowed a hole into the English circle then
      settled in Milan. His whist-playing came into requisition, and once more
      Fortune smiled upon Skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this house the pupil one evening accompanied the tutor. When the whist
      party, consisting of two tables, was formed, the young man found himself
      left out with an old gentleman, who seemed loquacious and good-natured,
      and who put many questions to Morton, which he found it difficult to
      answer. One of the whist tables was now in a state of revolution, viz., a
      lady had cut out and a gentleman cut in, when the door opened, and Lord
      Lilburne was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Macgregor, rising, advanced with great respect to this personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely ventured to hope you would coom, Lord Lilburne, the night is
      so cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not allow sufficiently, then, for the dulness of my solitary inn
      and the attractions of your circle. Aha! whist, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You play sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very seldom, now; I have sown all my wild oats, and even the ace of
      spades can scarcely dig them out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! vara gude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will look on;&rdquo; and Lord Lilburne drew his chair to the table, exactly
      opposite to Mr. Gawtrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman turned to Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An extraordinary man, Lord Lilburne; you have heard of him, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed; what of him?&rdquo; asked the young man, rousing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of him?&rdquo; said the old gentleman, with a smile; &ldquo;why the newspapers,
      if you ever read them, will tell you enough of the elegant, the witty Lord
      Lilburne; a man of eminent talent, though indolent. He was wild in his
      youth, as clever men often are; but, on attaining his title and fortune,
      and marrying into the family of the then premier, he became more sedate.
      They say he might make a great figure in politics if he would. He has a
      very high reputation&mdash;very. People do say that he is still fond of
      pleasure; but that is a common failing amongst the aristocracy. Morality
      is only found in the middle classes, young gentleman. It is a lucky
      family, that of Lilburne; his sister, Mrs. Beaufort&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beaufort!&rdquo; exclaimed Morton, and then muttered to himself, &ldquo;Ah, true&mdash;true;
      I have heard the name of Lilburne before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the Beauforts? Well, you remember how luckily Robert,
      Lilburne&rsquo;s brother-in-law, came into that fine property just as his
      predecessor was about to marry a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton scowled at his garrulous acquaintance, and stalked abruptly to the
      card table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since Lord Lilburne had seated himself opposite to Mr. Gawtrey, that
      gentleman had evinced a perturbation of manner that became obvious to the
      company. He grew deadly pale, his hands trembled, he moved uneasily in his
      seat, he missed deal, he trumped his partner&rsquo;s best diamond; finally he
      revoked, threw down his money, and said, with a forced smile, &ldquo;that the
      heat of the room overcame him.&rdquo; As he rose Lord Lilburne rose also, and
      the eyes of both met. Those of Lilburne were calm, but penetrating and
      inquisitive in their gaze; those of Gawtrey were like balls of fire. He
      seemed gradually to dilate in his height, his broad chest expanded, he
      breathed hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Doctor,&rdquo; said Mr. Macgregor, &ldquo;let me introduce you to Lord Lilburne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peer bowed haughtily; Mr. Gawtrey did not return the salutation, but
      with a sort of gulp, as if he were swallowing some burst of passion,
      strode to the fire, and then, turning round, again fixed his gaze upon the
      new guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilburne, however, who had never lost his self-composure at this strange
      rudeness, was now quietly talking with their host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Doctor seems an eccentric man&mdash;a little absent&mdash;learned, I
      suppose. Have you been to Como, yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gawtrey remained by the fire beating the devil&rsquo;s tattoo upon the
      chimney-piece, and ever and anon turning his glance towards Lilburne, who
      seemed to have forgotten his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both these guests stayed till the party broke up; Mr. Gawtrey apparently
      wishing to outstay Lord Lilburne; for, when the last went down-stairs, Mr.
      Gawtrey, nodding to his comrade and giving a hurried bow to the host,
      descended also. As they passed the porter&rsquo;s lodge, they found Lilburne on
      the step of his carriage; he turned his head abruptly, and again met Mr.
      Gawtrey&rsquo;s eye; paused a moment, and whispered over his shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we remember each other, sir? Let us not meet again; and, on that
      condition, bygones are bygones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo; muttered Gawtrey, clenching his fists; but the peer had
      sprung into his carriage with a lightness scarcely to be expected from his
      lameness, and the wheels whirled within an inch of the soi-disant doctor&rsquo;s
      right pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey walked on for some moments in great excitement; at length he
      turned to his companion,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you guess who Lord Lilburne is? I will tell you my first foe and
      Fanny&rsquo;s grandfather! Now, note the justice of Fate: here is this man&mdash;mark
      well&mdash;this man who commenced life by putting his faults on my own
      shoulders! From that little boss has fungused out a terrible hump. This
      man who seduced my affianced bride, and then left her whole soul, once
      fair and blooming&mdash;I swear it&mdash;with its leaves fresh from the
      dews of heaven, one rank leprosy, this man who, rolling in riches, learned
      to cheat and pilfer as a boy learns to dance and play the fiddle, and (to
      damn me, whose happiness he had blasted) accused me to the world of his
      own crime!&mdash;here is this man who has not left off one vice, but added
      to those of his youth the bloodless craft of the veteran knave;&mdash;here
      is this man, flattered, courted, great, marching through lanes of bowing
      parasites to an illustrious epitaph and a marble tomb, and I, a rogue too,
      if you will, but rogue for my bread, dating from him my errors and my
      ruin! I&mdash;vagabond&mdash;outcast&mdash;skulking through tricks to
      avoid crime&mdash;why the difference? Because one is born rich and the
      other poor&mdash;because he has no excuse for crime, and therefore no one
      suspects him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wretched man (for at that moment he was wretched) paused breathless
      from his passionate and rapid burst, and before him rose in its marble
      majesty, with the moon full upon its shining spires&mdash;the wonder of
      Gothic Italy&mdash;the Cathedral Church of Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chafe not yourself at the universal fate,&rdquo; said the young man, with a
      bitter smile on his lips and pointing to the cathedral; &ldquo;I have not lived
      long, but I have learned already enough to know this,&mdash; he who could
      raise a pile like that, dedicated to Heaven, would be honoured as a saint;
      he who knelt to God by the roadside under a hedge would be sent to the
      house of correction as a vagabond. The difference between man and man is
      money, and will be, when you, the despised charlatan, and Lilburne, the
      honoured cheat, have not left as much dust behind you as will fill a
      snuff-box. Comfort yourself, you are in the majority.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                &ldquo;A desert wild
     Before them stretched bare, comfortless, and vast,
     With gibbets, bones, and carcasses defiled.&rdquo;
              THOMPSON&rsquo;S Castle of Indolenece.
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Gawtrey did not wish to give his foe the triumph of thinking he had
      driven him from Milan; he resolved to stay and brave it out; but when he
      appeared in public, he found the acquaintances he had formed bow politely,
      but cross to the other side of the way. No more invitations to tea and
      cards showered in upon the jolly parson. He was puzzled, for people, while
      they shunned him, did not appear uncivil. He found out at last that a
      report was circulated that he was deranged; though he could not trace this
      rumour to Lord Lilburne, he was at no loss to guess from whom it had
      emanated. His own eccentricities, especially his recent manner at Mr.
      Macgregor&rsquo;s, gave confirmation to the charge. Again the funds began to
      sink low in the canvas bags, and at length, in despair, Mr. Gawtrey was
      obliged to quit the field. They returned to France through Switzerland&mdash;a
      country too poor for gamesters; and ever since the interview with
      Lilburne, a great change had come over Gawtrey&rsquo;s gay spirit: he grew moody
      and thoughtful, he took no pains to replenish the common stock, he talked
      much and seriously to his young friend of poor Fanny, and owned that he
      yearned to see her again. The desire to return to Paris haunted him like a
      fatality; he saw the danger that awaited him there, but it only allured
      him the more, as the candle does the moth whose wings it has singed.
      Birnie, who, in all their vicissitudes and wanderings, their ups and
      downs, retained the same tacit, immovable demeanour, received with a sneer
      the orders at last to march back upon the French capital. &ldquo;You would never
      have left it, if you had taken my advice,&rdquo; he said, and quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gawtrey gazed after him and muttered, &ldquo;Is the die then cast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; said Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will know soon,&rdquo; replied Gawtrey, and he followed Birnie; and from
      that time the whispered conferences with that person, which had seemed
      suspended during their travels, were renewed.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    ..........
</pre>
    <p>
      One morning, three men were seen entering Paris on foot through the Porte
      St. Denis. It was a fine day in spring, and the old city looked gay with
      its loitering passengers and gaudy shops, and under that clear blue
      exhilarating sky so peculiar to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of these men walked abreast, the other preceded them a few steps. The
      one who went first&mdash;thin, pale, and threadbare&mdash;yet seemed to
      suffer the least from fatigue; he walked with a long, swinging, noiseless
      stride, looking to the right and left from the corners of his eyes. Of the
      two who followed, one was handsome and finely formed, but of swarthy
      complexion, young, yet with a look of care; the other, of sturdy frame,
      leaned on a thick stick, and his eyes were gloomily cast down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; said the last, &ldquo;in coming back to Paris&mdash;I feel that I am
      coming back to my grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh&mdash;you were equally despondent in our excursions elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was always thinking of poor Fanny, and because&mdash;because&mdash;Birnie
      was ever at me with his horrible temptations!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Birnie! I loathe the man! Will you never get rid of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot! Hush! he will hear us. How unlucky we have been! and now
      without a sou in our pockets&mdash;here the dunghill&mdash;there the gaol!
      We are in his power at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His power! what mean you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ho! Birnie!&rdquo; cried Gawtrey, unheeding Morton&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Let us
      halt and breakfast: I am tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget!&mdash;we have no money till we make it,&rdquo; returned Birnie,
      coldly.&mdash;&ldquo;Come to the serrurier&rsquo;s he will trust us.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Gaunt Beggary and Scorn with many bell-hounds more.&rdquo;
      THOMSON&rsquo;S Castle of Indolence.

     &ldquo;The other was a fell, despiteful fiend.&rdquo;&mdash;Ibid.

</pre>
    <p>
      It may be observed that there are certain years in which in a civilised
      country some particular crime comes into vogue. It flares its season, and
      then burns out. Thus at one time we have Burking&mdash;at another,
      Swingism&mdash;now, suicide is in vogue&mdash;now, poisoning tradespeople
      in apple-dumplings&mdash;now, little boys stab each other with penknives&mdash;now,
      common soldiers shoot at their sergeants. Almost every year there is one
      crime peculiar to it; a sort of annual which overruns the country but does
      not bloom again. Unquestionably the Press has a great deal to do with
      these epidemics. Let a newspaper once give an account of some
      out-of-the-way atrocity that has the charm of being novel, and certain
      depraved minds fasten to it like leeches. They brood over and revolve it&mdash;the
      idea grows up, a horrid phantasmalian monomania; and all of a sudden, in a
      hundred different places, the one seed sown by the leaden types springs up
      into foul flowering.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [An old Spanish writer, treating of the Inquisition, has some very
   striking remarks on the kind of madness which, whenever some
   terrible notoriety is given to a particular offence, leads persons
   of distempered fancy to accuse themselves of it. He observes that
   when the cruelties of the Inquisition against the imaginary crime of
   sorcery were the most barbarous, this singular frenzy led numbers to
   accuse themselves of sorcery. The publication and celebrity of the
   crime begat the desire of the crime.]
</pre>
    <p>
      But if the first reported aboriginal crime has been attended with
      impunity, how much more does the imitative faculty cling to it. Ill-judged
      mercy falls, not like dew, but like a great heap of manure, on the rank
      deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that at the time I write of, or rather a little before,
      there had been detected and tried in Paris a most redoubted coiner. He had
      carried on the business with a dexterity that won admiration even for the
      offence; and, moreover, he had served previously with some distinction at
      Austerlitz and Marengo. The consequence was that the public went with
      instead of against him, and his sentence was transmuted to three years&rsquo; 
      imprisonment by the government. For all governments in free countries
      aspire rather to be popular than just.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was this case reported in the journals&mdash;and even the
      gravest took notice, of it (which is not common with the scholastic
      journals of France)&mdash;no sooner did it make a stir and a sensation,
      and cover the criminal with celebrity, than the result became noticeable
      in a very large issue of false money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coining in the year I now write of was the fashionable crime. The police
      were roused into full vigour: it became known to them that there was one
      gang in especial who cultivated this art with singular success. Their
      coinage was, indeed, so good, so superior to all their rivals, that it was
      often unconsciously preferred by the public to the real mintage. At the
      same time they carried on their calling with such secrecy that they
      utterly baffled discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense reward was offered by the bureau to any one who would betray
      his accomplices, and Monsieur Favart was placed at the head of a
      commission of inquiry. This person had himself been a faux monnoyer, and
      was an adept in the art, and it was he who had discovered the redoubted
      coiner who had brought the crime into such notoriety. Monsieur Favart was
      a man of the most vigilant acuteness, the most indefatigable research, and
      of a courage which; perhaps, is more common than we suppose. It is a
      popular error to suppose that courage means courage in everything. Put a
      hero on board ship at a five-barred gate, and, if he is not used to
      hunting, he will turn pale; put a fox-hunter on one of the Swiss chasms,
      over which the mountaineer springs like a roe, and his knees will knock
      under him. People are brave in the dangers to which they accustom
      themselves, either in imagination or practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Favart, then, was a man of the most daring bravery in facing
      rogues and cut-throats. He awed them with his very eye; yet he had been
      known to have been kicked down-stairs by his wife, and when he was drawn
      into the grand army, he deserted the eve of his first battle. Such, as
      moralists say, is the inconsistency of man!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Monsieur Favart was sworn to trace the coiners, and he had never
      failed yet in any enterprise he undertook. One day he presented himself to
      his chief with a countenance so elated that that penetrating functionary
      said to him at once&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard of our messieurs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have: I am to visit them to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! How many men will you take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From twelve to twenty to leave without on guard. But I must enter alone.
      Such is the condition: an accomplice who fears his own throat too much to
      be openly a betrayer will introduce me to the house&mdash;nay, to the very
      room. By his description it is necessary I should know the exact locale in
      order to cut off retreat; so to-morrow night I shall surround the beehive
      and take the honey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are desperate fellows, these coiners, always; better be cautious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget I was one of them, and know the masonry.&rdquo; About the same time
      this conversation was going on at the bureau of the police, in another
      part of the town Morton and Gawtrey were seated alone. It is some weeks
      since they entered Paris, and spring has mellowed into summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house in which they lodged was in the lordly quartier of the Faubourg
      St. Germain; the neighbouring streets were venerable with the ancient
      edifices of a fallen noblesse; but their tenement was in a narrow, dingy
      lane, and the building itself seemed beggarly and ruinous. The apartment
      was in an attic on the sixth story, and the window, placed at the back of
      the lane, looked upon another row of houses of a better description, that
      communicated with one of the great streets of the quartier. The space
      between their abode and their opposite neighbours was so narrow that the
      sun could scarcely pierce between. In the height of summer might be found
      there a perpetual shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair were seated by the window. Gawtrey, well-dressed, smooth-shaven,
      as in his palmy time; Morton, in the same garments with which he had
      entered Paris, weather-stained and ragged. Looking towards the casements
      of the attic in the opposite house, Gawtrey said, mutteringly, &ldquo;I wonder
      where Birnie has been, and why he has not returned. I grow suspicious of
      that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspicious of what?&rdquo; asked Morton. &ldquo;Of his honesty? Would he rob you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rob me! Humph&mdash;perhaps! but you see I am in Paris, in spite of the
      hints of the police; he may denounce me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, suffer him to lodge away from you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? because, by having separate houses there are two channels of escape.
      A dark night, and a ladder thrown across from window to window, he is with
      us, or we with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wherefore such precautions? You blind&mdash;you deceive me; what have
      you done?&mdash;what is your employment now? You are mute. Hark you,
      Gawtrey. I have pinned my fate to you&mdash;I am fallen from hope itself!
      At times it almost makes me mad to look back&mdash;and yet you do not
      trust me. Since your return to Paris you are absent whole nights&mdash;often
      days; you are moody and thoughtful&mdash;yet, whatever your business, it
      seems to bring you ample returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that,&rdquo; said Gawtrey, mildly, and with a sort of pity in his
      voice; &ldquo;yet you refuse to take even the money to change those rags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know not how the money was gained. Ah, Gawtrey, I am not too
      proud for charity, but I am for&mdash;&rdquo; He checked the word uppermost in
      his thoughts, and resumed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; your occupations seem lucrative. It was but yesterday Birnie gave me
      fifty napoleons, for which he said you wished change in silver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he? The ras&mdash; Well! and you got change for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not why, but I refused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was right, Philip. Do nothing that man tells you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, then, trust me? You are engaged in some horrible traffic! it
      may be blood! I am no longer a boy&mdash;I have a will of my own&mdash;I
      will not be silently and blindly entrapped to perdition. If I march
      thither, it shall be with my own consent. Trust me, and this day, or we
      part to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be ruled. Some secrets it is better not to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters not. I have come to my decision&mdash;I ask yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey paused for some moments in deep thought. At last he lifted his
      eyes to Philip, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, if it must be. Sooner or later it must have been so; and I
      want a confidant. You are bold, and will not shrink. You desire to know my
      occupation&mdash;will you witness it to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prepared: to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a step was heard on the stairs&mdash;a knock at the door&mdash;and
      Birnie entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew aside Gawtrey, and whispered him, as usual, for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey nodded his head, and then said aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow we shall talk without reserve before my young friend. To-night
      he joins us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night!&mdash;very well,&rdquo; said Birnie, with his cold sneer. &ldquo;He must
      take the oath; and you, with your life, will be responsible for his
      honesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! it is the rule.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, then, till we meet,&rdquo; said Birnie, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Gawtrey, musingly, and between his grinded teeth,
      &ldquo;whether I shall ever have a good fair shot at that fellow? Ho! ho!&rdquo; and
      his laugh shook the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton looked hard at Gawtrey, as the latter now sank down in his chair,
      and gazed with a vacant stare, that seemed almost to partake of
      imbecility, upon the opposite wall. The careless, reckless, jovial
      expression, which usually characterised the features of the man, had for
      some weeks given place to a restless, anxious, and at times ferocious
      aspect, like the beast that first finds a sport while the hounds are yet
      afar, and his limbs are yet strong, in the chase which marks him for his
      victim, but grows desperate with rage and fear as the day nears its close,
      and the death-dogs pant hard upon his track. But at that moment the strong
      features, with their gnarled muscle and iron sinews, seemed to have lost
      every sign both of passion and the will, and to be locked in a stolid and
      dull repose. At last he looked up at Morton, and said, with a smile like
      that of an old man in his dotage&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking that my life has been one mistake! I had talents&mdash;you
      would not fancy it&mdash;but once I was neither a fool nor a villain! Odd,
      isn&rsquo;t it? Just reach me the brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Morton, with a slight shudder, turned and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on mechanically, and gained, at last, the superb Quai that
      borders the Seine; there, the passengers became more frequent; gay
      equipages rolled along; the white and lofty mansions looked fair and
      stately in the clear blue sky of early summer; beside him flowed the
      sparkling river, animated with the painted baths that floated on its
      surface: earth was merry and heaven serene his heart was dark through all:
      Night within&mdash;Morning beautiful without! At last he paused by that
      bridge, stately with the statues of those whom the caprice of time honours
      with a name; for though Zeus and his gods be overthrown, while earth
      exists will live the worship of Dead Men;&mdash;the bridge by which you
      pass from the royal Tuileries, or the luxurious streets beyond the Rue de
      Rivoli, to the Senate of the emancipated People, and the gloomy and
      desolate grandeur of the Faubourg St. Germain, in whose venerable haunts
      the impoverished descendants of the old feudal tyrants, whom the birth of
      the Senate overthrew, yet congregate;&mdash;the ghosts of departed powers
      proud of the shadows of great names. As the English outcast paused midway
      on the bridge, and for the first time lifting his head from his bosom,
      gazed around, there broke at once on his remembrance that terrible and
      fatal evening, when, hopeless, friendless, desperate, he had begged for
      charity of his uncle&rsquo;s hireling, with all the feelings that then (so
      imperfectly and lightly touched on in his brief narrative to Gawtrey) had
      raged and blackened in his breast, urging to the resolution he had
      adopted, casting him on the ominous friendship of the man whose guidance
      he even then had suspected and distrusted. The spot in either city had a
      certain similitude and correspondence each with each: at the first he had
      consummated his despair of human destinies&mdash;he had dared to forget
      the Providence of God&mdash;he had arrogated his fate to himself: by the
      first bridge he had taken his resolve; by the last he stood in awe at the
      result&mdash;stood no less poor&mdash;no less abject&mdash;equally in rags
      and squalor; but was his crest as haughty and his eye as fearless, for was
      his conscience as free and his honour as unstained? Those arches of stone&mdash;those
      rivers that rolled between, seemed to him then to take a more mystic and
      typical sense than belongs to the outer world&mdash;they were the bridges
      to the Rivers of his Life. Plunged in thoughts so confused and dim that he
      could scarcely distinguish, through the chaos, the one streak of light
      which, perhaps, heralded the reconstruction or regeneration of the
      elements of his soul;&mdash;two passengers halted, also by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be late for the debate,&rdquo; said one of them to the other. &ldquo;Why do
      you stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I never pass this spot without recalling the
      time when I stood here without a son, or, as I thought, a chance of one,
      and impiously meditated self-destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&mdash;now so rich&mdash;so fortunate in repute and station&mdash;is
      it possible? How was it? A lucky chance?&mdash;a sudden legacy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: Time, Faith, and Energy&mdash;the three Friends God has given to the
      Poor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men moved on; but Morton, who had turned his face towards them,
      fancied that the last speaker fixed on him his bright, cheerful eye, with
      a meaning look; and when the man was gone, he repeated those words, and
      hailed them in his heart of hearts as an augury from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly, then, and as if by magic, the former confusion of his mind seemed
      to settle into distinct shapes of courage and resolve. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he muttered;
      &ldquo;I will keep this night&rsquo;s appointment&mdash;I will learn the secret of
      these men&rsquo;s life. In my inexperience and destitution, I have suffered
      myself to be led hitherto into a partnership, if not with vice and crime,
      at least with subterfuge and trick. I awake from my reckless boyhood&mdash;my
      unworthy palterings with my better self. If Gawtrey be as I dread to find
      him&mdash;if he be linked in some guilty and hateful traffic; with that
      loathsome accomplice&mdash;I will&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, for his heart
      whispered, &ldquo;Well, and even so,&mdash;the guilty man clothed and fed thee!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; resumed his thought, in answer to his heart&mdash;&ldquo;I will go on
      my knees to him to fly while there is yet time, to work&mdash;beg&mdash;starve&mdash;perish
      even&mdash;rather than lose the right to look man in the face without a
      blush, and kneel to his God without remorse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he thus ended, he felt suddenly as if he himself were restored to
      the perception and the joy of the Nature and the World around him; the
      NIGHT had vanished from his soul&mdash;he inhaled the balm and freshness
      of the air&mdash;he comprehended the delight which the liberal June was
      scattering over the earth&mdash;he looked above, and his eyes were
      suffused with pleasure, at the smile of the soft blue skies. The MORNING
      became, as it were, a part of his own being; and he felt that as the world
      in spite of the storms is fair, so in spite of evil God is good. He walked
      on&mdash;he passed the bridge, but his step was no more the same,&mdash;he
      forgot his rags. Why should he be ashamed? And thus, in the very flush of
      this new and strange elation and elasticity of spirit, he came unawares
      upon a group of young men, lounging before the porch of one of the chief
      hotels in that splendid Rue de Rivoli, wherein Wealth and the English have
      made their homes. A groom, mounted, was leading another horse up and down
      the road, and the young men were making their comments of approbation upon
      both the horses, especially the one led, which was, indeed, of uncommon
      beauty and great value. Even Morton, in whom the boyish passion of his
      earlier life yet existed, paused to turn his experienced and admiring eye
      upon the stately shape and pace of the noble animal, and as he did so, a
      name too well remembered came upon his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Arthur Beaufort is the most enviable fellow in Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said another of the young men; &ldquo;he has plenty of money&mdash;is
      good-looking, devilish good-natured, clever, and spends like a prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the best horses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best luck at roulette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prettiest girls in love with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one enjoys life more. Ah! here he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The group parted as a light, graceful figure came out of a jeweller&rsquo;s shop
      that adjoined the hotel, and halted gaily amongst the loungers. Morton&rsquo;s
      first impulse was to hurry from the spot; his second impulse arrested his
      step, and, a little apart, and half-hid beneath one of the arches of the
      colonnade which adorns the street, the Outcast gazed upon the Heir. There
      was no comparison in the natural personal advantages of the two young men;
      for Philip Morton, despite all the hardships of his rough career, had now
      grown up and ripened into a rare perfection of form and feature. His broad
      chest, his erect air, his lithe and symmetrical length of limb, united,
      happily, the attributes of activity and strength; and though there was no
      delicacy of youthful bloom upon his dark cheek, and though lines which
      should have come later marred its smoothness with the signs of care and
      thought, yet an expression of intelligence and daring, equally beyond his
      years, and the evidence of hardy, abstemious, vigorous health, served to
      show to the full advantage the outline of features which, noble and
      regular, though stern and masculine, the artist might have borrowed for
      his ideal of a young Spartan arming for his first battle. Arthur, slight
      to feebleness, and with the paleness, partly of constitution, partly of
      gay excess, on his fair and clear complexion, had features far less
      symmetrical and impressive than his cousin: but what then? All that are
      bestowed by elegance of dress, the refinements of luxurious habit, the
      nameless grace that comes from a mind and a manner polished, the one by
      literary culture, the other by social intercourse, invested the person of
      the heir with a fascination that rude Nature alone ever fails to give. And
      about him there was a gaiety, an airiness of spirit, an atmosphere of
      enjoyment which bespoke one who is in love with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this is lucky! I&rsquo;m so glad to see you all!&rdquo; said Arthur Beaufort,
      with that silver-ringing tone and charming smile which are to the happy
      spring of man what its music and its sunshine are to the spring of earth.
      &ldquo;You must dine with me at Verey&rsquo;s. I want something to rouse me to-day;
      for I did not get home from the Salon* till four this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Marsden. Hang it! I always win: I who could so well afford to lose:
      I&rsquo;m quite ashamed of my luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy to spend what one wins,&rdquo; observed Mr. Marsden, sententiously;
      &ldquo;and I see you have been at the jeweller&rsquo;s! A present for Cecile? Well,
      don&rsquo;t blush, my dear fellow. What is life without women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wine?&rdquo; said a second. &ldquo;And play?&rdquo; said a third. &ldquo;And wealth?&rdquo; said a
      fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you enjoy them all! Happy fellow!&rdquo; said a fifth. The Outcast pulled
      his hat over his brows, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This dear Paris,&rdquo; said Beaufort, as his eye carelessly and unconsciously
      followed the dark form retreating through the arches;&mdash;&ldquo;this dear
      Paris! I must make the most of it while I stay! I have only been here a
      few weeks, and next week I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh&mdash;your health is better: you don&rsquo;t look like the same man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so really? Still I don&rsquo;t know: the doctors say that I must
      either go to the German waters&mdash;the season is begun&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live less with such pleasant companions, my dear fellow! But as you say,
      what is life without&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wealth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha. &lsquo;Throw physic to the dogs: I&rsquo;ll none of it!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Arthur leaped lightly on his saddle, and as he rode gaily on, humming
      the favourite air of the last opera, the hoofs of his horse splashed the
      mud over a foot-passenger halting at the crossing. Morton checked the
      fiery exclamation rising to his lips; and gazing after the brilliant form
      that hurried on towards the Champs Elysees, his eye caught the statues on
      the bridge, and a voice, as of a cheering angel, whispered again to his
      heart, &ldquo;TIME, FAITH, ENERGY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of his countenance grew calm at once, and as he continued
      his rambles it was with a mind that, casting off the burdens of the past,
      looked serenely and steadily on the obstacles and hardships of the future.
      We have seen that a scruple of conscience or of pride, not without its
      nobleness, had made him refuse the importunities of Gawtrey for less
      sordid raiment; the same feeling made it his custom to avoid sharing the
      luxurious and dainty food with which Gawtrey was wont to regale himself.
      For that strange man, whose wonderful felicity of temperament and
      constitution rendered him, in all circumstances, keenly alive to the
      hearty and animal enjoyments of life, would still emerge, as the day
      declined, from their wretched apartment, and, trusting to his disguises,
      in which indeed he possessed a masterly art, repair to one of the better
      description of restaurants, and feast away his cares for the moment.
      William Gawtrey would not have cared three straws for the curse of
      Damocles. The sword over his head would never have spoiled his appetite!
      He had lately, too, taken to drinking much more deeply than he had been
      used to do&mdash;the fine intellect of the man was growing thickened and
      dulled; and this was a spectacle that Morton could not bear to
      contemplate. Yet so great was Gawtrey&rsquo;s vigour of health, that, after
      draining wine and spirits enough to have despatched a company of
      fox-hunters, and after betraying, sometimes in uproarious glee, sometimes
      in maudlin self-bewailings, that he himself was not quite invulnerable to
      the thyrsus of the god, he would&mdash;on any call on his energies, or
      especially before departing on those mysterious expeditions which kept him
      from home half, and sometimes all, the night&mdash;plunge his head into
      cold water&mdash;drink as much of the lymph as a groom would have
      shuddered to bestow on a horse&mdash;close his eyes in a doze for half an
      hour, and wake, cool, sober, and collected, as if he had lived according
      to the precepts of Socrates or Cornaro!
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Morton. It was his habit to avoid as much as possible
      sharing the good cheer of his companion; and now, as he entered the Champs
      Elysees, he saw a little family, consisting of a young mechanic, his wife,
      and two children, who, with that love of harmless recreation which yet
      characterises the French, had taken advantage of a holiday in the craft,
      and were enjoying their simple meal under the shadow of the trees. Whether
      in hunger or in envy, Morton paused and contemplated the happy group.
      Along the road rolled the equipages and trampled the steeds of those to
      whom all life is a holiday. There, was Pleasure&mdash;under those trees
      was Happiness. One of the children, a little boy of about six years old,
      observing the attitude and gaze of the pausing wayfarer, ran to him, and
      holding up a fragment of a coarse kind of cake, said to him, willingly,
      &ldquo;Take it&mdash;I have had enough!&rdquo; The child reminded Morton of his
      brother&mdash;his heart melted within him&mdash;he lifted the young
      Samaritan in his arms, and as he kissed him, wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother observed and rose also. She laid her hand on his own: &ldquo;Poor
      boy! why do you weep?&mdash;can we relieve you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that bright gleam of human nature, suddenly darting across the sombre
      recollections and associations of his past life, seemed to Morton as if it
      came from Heaven, in approval and in blessing of this attempt at
      reconciliation to his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said he, placing the child on the ground, and passing his
      hand over his eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;I thank you&mdash;yes! Let me sit down amongst
      you.&rdquo; And he sat down, the child by his side, and partook of their fare,
      and was merry with them,&mdash;the proud Philip!&mdash;had he not begun to
      discover the &ldquo;precious jewel&rdquo; in the &ldquo;ugly and venomous&rdquo; Adversity?
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanic, though a gay fellow on the whole, was not without some of
      that discontent of his station which is common with his class; he vented
      it, however, not in murmurs, but in jests. He was satirical on the
      carriages and the horsemen that passed; and, lolling on the grass,
      ridiculed his betters at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said his wife, suddenly; &ldquo;here comes Madame de Merville;&rdquo; and
      rising as she spoke, she made a respectful inclination of her head towards
      an open carriage that was passing very slowly towards the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Merville!&rdquo; repeated the husband, rising also, and lifting his
      cap from his head. &ldquo;Ah! I have nothing to say against her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton looked instinctively towards the carriage, and saw a fair
      countenance turned graciously to answer the silent salutations of the
      mechanic and his wife&mdash;a countenance that had long haunted his
      dreams, though of late it had faded away beneath harsher thoughts&mdash;the
      countenance of the stranger whom he had seen at the bureau of Gawtrey,
      when that worthy personage had borne a more mellifluous name. He started
      and changed colour: the lady herself now seemed suddenly to recognise him;
      for their eyes met, and she bent forward eagerly. She pulled the
      check-string&mdash;the carriage halted&mdash;she beckoned to the
      mechanic&rsquo;s wife, who went up to the roadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I worked once for that lady,&rdquo; said the man with a tone of feeling; &ldquo;and
      when my wife fell ill last winter she paid the doctors. Ah, she is an
      angel of charity and kindness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton scarcely heard this eulogium, for he observed, by something eager
      and inquisitive in the face of Madame de Merville, and by the sudden
      manner in which the mechanic&rsquo;s helpmate turned her head to the spot in
      which he stood, that he was the object of their conversation. Once more he
      became suddenly aware of his ragged dress, and with a natural shame&mdash;a
      fear that charity might be extended to him from her&mdash;he muttered an
      abrupt farewell to the operative, and without another glance at the
      carriage, walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had got many paces, the wife however came up to him, breathless.
      &ldquo;Madame de Merville would speak to you, sir!&rdquo; she said, with more respect
      than she had hitherto thrown into her manner. Philip paused an instant,
      and again strode on&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be some mistake,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly: &ldquo;I have no right to expect
      such an honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck across the road, gained the opposite side, and had vanished from
      Madame de Merville&rsquo;s eyes, before the woman regained the carriage. But
      still that calm, pale, and somewhat melancholy face, presented itself
      before him; and as he walked again through the town, sweet and gentle
      fancies crowded confusedly on his heart. On that soft summer day,
      memorable for so many silent but mighty events in that inner life which
      prepares the catastrophes of the outer one; as in the region, of which
      Virgil has sung, the images of men to be born hereafter repose or glide&mdash;on
      that soft summer day, he felt he had reached the age when Youth begins to
      clothe in some human shape its first vague ideal of desire and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such thoughts, and still wandering, the day wore away, till he found
      himself in one of the lanes that surround that glittering Microcosm of the
      vices, the frivolities, the hollow show, and the real beggary of the gay
      City&mdash;the gardens and the galleries of the Palais Royal. Surprised at
      the lateness of the hour, it was then on the stroke of seven, he was about
      to return homewards, when the loud voice of Gawtrey sounded behind, and
      that personage, tapping him on the back, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hollo, my young friend, well met! This will be a night of trial to you.
      Empty stomachs produce weak nerves. Come along! you must dine with me. A
      good dinner and a bottle of old wine&mdash;come! nonsense, I say you shall
      come! Vive la joie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, he had linked his arm in Morton&rsquo;s, and hurried him on
      several paces in spite of his struggles; but just as the words Vive la
      joie left his lips, he stood still and mute, as if a thunderbolt had
      fallen at his feet; and Morton felt that heavy arm shiver and tremble like
      a leaf. He looked up, and just at the entrance of that part of the Palais
      Royal in which are situated the restaurants of Verey and Vefour, he saw
      two men standing but a few paces before them, and gazing full on Gawtrey
      and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my evil genius,&rdquo; muttered Gawtrey, grinding his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine!&rdquo; said Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger of the two men thus apostrophised made a step towards Philip,
      when his companion drew him back and whispered,&mdash;&ldquo;What are you about&mdash;do
      you know that young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my cousin; Philip Beaufort&rsquo;s natural son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he? then discard him for ever. He is with the most dangerous knave in
      Europe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Lilburne&mdash;for it was he&mdash;thus whispered his nephew,
      Gawtrey strode up to him; and, glaring full in his face, said in a deep
      and hollow tone,&mdash;&ldquo;There is a hell, my lord,&mdash;I go to drink to
      our meeting!&rdquo; Thus saying, he took off his hat with a ceremonious mockery,
      and disappeared within the adjoining restaurant, kept by Vefour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hell!&rdquo; said Lilburne, with his frigid smile; &ldquo;the rogue&rsquo;s head runs
      upon gambling-houses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have suffered Philip again to escape me,&rdquo; said Arthur, in
      self-reproach: for while Gawtrey had addressed Lord Lilburne, Morton had
      plunged back amidst the labyrinth of alleys. &ldquo;How have I kept my oath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! your guests must have arrived by this time. As for that wretched
      young man, depend upon it that he is corrupted body and soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is my own cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! there is no relationship in natural children: besides, he will find
      you out fast enough. Ragged claimants are not long too proud to beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak in earnest?&rdquo; said Arthur, irresolutely. &ldquo;Ay! trust my
      experience of the world&mdash;Allons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in a cabinet of the very restaurant, adjoining that in which the
      solitary Gawtrey gorged his conscience, Lilburne, Arthur, and their gay
      friends, soon forgetful of all but the roses of the moment, bathed their
      airy spirits in the dews of the mirthful wine. Oh, extremes of life! Oh,
      Night! Oh, Morning!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime a moving scene was open laid, That lazar house.&rdquo;&mdash;THOMSON&rsquo;S
      Castle of Indolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near midnight. At the mouth of the lane in which Gawtrey resided
      there stood four men. Not far distant, in the broad street at angles with
      the lane, were heard the wheels of carriages and the sound of music. A
      lady, fair in form, tender of heart, stainless in repute, was receiving
      her friends!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Favart,&rdquo; said one of the men to the smallest of the four; &ldquo;you
      understand the conditions&mdash;20,000 francs and a free pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more reasonable&mdash;it is understood. Still I confess that I
      should like to have my men close at hand. I am not given to fear; but this
      is a dangerous experiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew the danger beforehand and subscribed to it: you must enter alone
      with me, or not at all. Mark you, the men are sworn to murder him who
      betrays them. Not for twenty times 20,000 francs would I have them know me
      as the informer. My life were not worth a day&rsquo;s purchase. Now, if you feel
      secure in your disguise, all is safe. You will have seen them at their
      work&mdash;you will recognise their persons&mdash;you can depose against
      them at the trial&mdash;I shall have time to quit France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind, you must wait in the vault with them till they separate. We have so
      planted your men that whatever street each of the gang takes in going
      home, he can be seized quietly and at once. The bravest and craftiest of
      all, who, though he has but just joined, is already their captain;&mdash;him,
      the man I told you of, who lives in the house, you must take after his
      return, in his bed. It is the sixth story to the right, remember: here is
      the key to his door. He is a giant in strength; and will never be taken
      alive if up and armed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I comprehend!&mdash;Gilbert&rdquo; (and Favart turned to one of his
      companions who had not yet spoken) &ldquo;take three men besides yourself,
      according to the directions I gave you,&mdash;the porter will admit you,
      that&rsquo;s arranged. Make no noise. If I don&rsquo;t return by four o&rsquo;clock, don&rsquo;t
      wait for me, but proceed at once. Look well to your primings. Take him
      alive, if possible&mdash;at the worst, dead. And now&mdash;mon ami&mdash;lead
      on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The traitor nodded, and walked slowly down the street. Favart, pausing,
      whispered hastily to the man whom he had called Gilbert,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me close&mdash;get to the door of the cellar-place eight men
      within hearing of my whistle&mdash;recollect the picklocks, the axes. If
      you hear the whistle, break in; if not, I&rsquo;m safe, and the first orders to
      seize the captain in his room stand good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Favart strode after his guide. The door of a large, but
      ill-favoured-looking house stood ajar&mdash;they entered-passed unmolested
      through a court-yard&mdash;descended some stairs; the guide unlocked the
      door of a cellar, and took a dark lantern from under his cloak. As he drew
      up the slide, the dim light gleamed on barrels and wine-casks, which
      appeared to fill up the space. Rolling aside one of these, the guide
      lifted a trap-door, and lowered his lantern. &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; said he; and the two
      men disappeared.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      ........
</pre>
    <p>
      The coiners were at their work. A man, seated on a stool before a desk,
      was entering accounts in a large book. That man was William Gawtrey.
      While, with the rapid precision of honest mechanics, the machinery of the
      Dark Trade went on in its several departments. Apart&mdash;alone&mdash;at
      the foot of a long table, sat Philip Morton. The truth had exceeded his
      darkest suspicions. He had consented to take the oath not to divulge what
      was to be given to his survey; and when, led into that vault, the bandage
      was taken from his eyes, it was some minutes before he could fully
      comprehend the desperate and criminal occupations of the wild forms amidst
      which towered the burly stature of his benefactor. As the truth slowly
      grew upon him, he shrank from the side of Gawtrey; but, deep compassion
      for his friend&rsquo;s degradation swallowing up the horror of the trade, he
      flung himself on one of the rude seats, and felt that the bond between
      them was indeed broken, and that the next morning he should be again alone
      in the world. Still, as the obscene jests, the fearful oaths, that from
      time to time rang through the vault, came on his ear, he cast his haughty
      eye in such disdain over the groups, that Gawtrey, observing him, trembled
      for his safety; and nothing but Philip&rsquo;s sense of his own impotence, and
      the brave, not timorous, desire not to perish by such hands, kept silent
      the fiery denunciations of a nature still proud and honest, that quivered
      on his lips. All present were armed with pistols and cutlasses except
      Morton, who suffered the weapons presented to him to lie unheeded on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, mes amis!&rdquo; said Gawtrey, closing his book,&mdash;&ldquo;Courage!&mdash;a
      few months more, and we shall have made enough to retire upon, and enjoy
      ourselves for the rest of the days. Where is Birnie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he not tell you?&rdquo; said one of the artisans, looking up. &ldquo;He has found
      out the cleverest hand in France, the very fellow who helped Bouchard in
      all his five-franc pieces. He has promised to bring him to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I remember,&rdquo; returned Gawtrey, &ldquo;he told me this morning,&mdash;he is
      a famous decoy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, indeed!&rdquo; quoth a coiner; &ldquo;for he caught you, the best head to
      our hands that ever les industriels were blessed with&mdash;sacre
      fichtre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flatterer!&rdquo; said Gawtrey, coming from the desk to the table, and pouring
      out wine from one of the bottles into a huge flagon&mdash;&ldquo;To your
      healths!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the door slided back, and Birnie glided in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your booty, mon brave?&rdquo; said Gawtrey. &ldquo;We only coin money; you
      coin men, stamp with your own seal, and send them current to the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coiners, who liked Birnie&rsquo;s ability (for the ci-devant engraver was of
      admirable skill in their craft), but who hated his joyless manners,
      laughed at this taunt, which Birnie did not seem to heed, except by a
      malignant gleam of his dead eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean the celebrated coiner, Jacques Giraumont, he waits without.
      You know our rules. I cannot admit him without leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon! we give it,&mdash;eh, messieurs?&rdquo; said Gawtrey. &ldquo;Ay-ay,&rdquo; cried
      several voices. &ldquo;He knows the oath, and will hear the penalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he knows the oath,&rdquo; replied Birnie, and glided back.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more he returned with a small man in a mechanic&rsquo;s blouse. The
      new comer wore the republican beard and moustache&mdash;of a sandy grey&mdash;his
      hair was the same colour; and a black patch over one eye increased the
      ill-favoured appearance of his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diable! Monsieur Giraumont! but you are more like Vulcan than Adonis!&rdquo;
       said Gawtrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about Vulcan, but I know how to make five-franc
      pieces,&rdquo; said Monsieur Giraumont, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a church mouse! The only thing belonging to a church, since the
      Bourbons came back, that is poor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this sally, the coiners, who had gathered round the table, uttered the
      shout with which, in all circumstances, Frenchmen receive a bon mot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Gawtrey. &ldquo;Who responds with his own life for your fidelity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Birnie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Administer the oath to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly four men advanced, seized the visitor, and bore him from the
      vault into another one within. After a few moments they returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has taken the oath and heard the penalty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death to yourself, your wife, your son, and your grandson, if you betray
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have neither son nor grandson; as for my wife, Monsieur le Capitaine,
      you offer a bribe instead of a threat when you talk of her death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sacre! but you will be an addition to our circle, mon brave!&rdquo; said
      Gawtrey, laughing; while again the grim circle shouted applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I suppose you care for your own life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise I should have preferred starving to coming here,&rdquo; answered the
      laconic neophyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done with you. Your health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this the coiners gathered round Monsieur Giraumont, shook him by the
      hand, and commenced many questions with a view to ascertain his skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me your coinage first; I see you use both the die and the furnace.
      Hem! this piece is not bad&mdash;you have struck it from an iron die?&mdash;right&mdash;it
      makes the impression sharper than plaster of Paris. But you take the
      poorest and the most dangerous part of the trade in taking the home
      market. I can put you in a way to make ten times as much&mdash;and with
      safety. Look at this!&rdquo;&mdash;and Monsieur Giraumont took a forged Spanish
      dollar from his pocket, so skilfully manufactured that the connoisseurs
      were lost in admiration&mdash;&ldquo;you may pass thousands of these all over
      Europe, except France, and who is ever to detect you? But it will require
      better machinery than you have here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus conversing, Monsieur Giraumont did not perceive that Mr. Gawtrey had
      been examining him very curiously and minutely. But Birnie had noted their
      chief&rsquo;s attention, and once attempted to join his new ally, when Gawtrey
      laid his hand on his shoulder, and stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak to your friend till I bid you, or&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped short,
      and touched his pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birnie grew a shade more pale, but replied with his usual sneer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspicious!&mdash;well, so much the better!&rdquo; and seating himself
      carelessly at the table, lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Monsieur Giraumont,&rdquo; said Gawtrey, as he took the head of the
      table, &ldquo;come to my right hand. A half-holiday in your honour. Clear these
      infernal instruments; and more wine, mes amis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The party arranged themselves at the table. Among the desperate there is
      almost invariably a tendency to mirth. A solitary ruffian, indeed, is
      moody, but a gang of ruffians are jovial. The coiners talked and laughed
      loud. Mr. Birnie, from his dogged silence, seemed apart from the rest,
      though in the centre. For in a noisy circle a silent tongue builds a wall
      round its owner. But that respectable personage kept his furtive watch
      upon Giraumont and Gawtrey, who appeared talking together, very amicably.
      The younger novice of that night, equally silent, seated towards the
      bottom of the table, was not less watchful than Birnie. An uneasy,
      undefinable foreboding had come over him since the entrance of Monsieur
      Giraumont; this had been increased by the manner of Mr. Gawtrey. His
      faculty of observation, which was very acute, had detected something false
      in the chief&rsquo;s blandness to their guest&mdash;something dangerous in the
      glittering eye that Gawtrey ever, as he spoke to Giraumont, bent on that
      person&rsquo;s lips as he listened to his reply. For, whenever William Gawtrey
      suspected a man, he watched not his eyes, but his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waked from his scornful reverie, a strange spell chained Morton&rsquo;s
      attention to the chief and the guest, and he bent forward, with parted
      mouth and straining ear, to catch their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me a little strange,&rdquo; said Mr. Gawtrey, raising his voice so
      as to be heard by the party, &ldquo;that a coiner so dexterous as Monsieur
      Giraumont should not be known to any of us except our friend Birnie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Giraumont; &ldquo;I worked only with Bouchard and two
      others since sent to the galleys. We were but a small fraternity&mdash;everything
      has its commencement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&rsquo;est juste: buvez, donc, cher ami!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wine circulated. Gawtrey began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a bad accident, seemingly, Monsieur Giraumont. How did you
      lose your eye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a scuffle with the gens d&rsquo; armes the night Bouchard was taken and I
      escaped. Such misfortunes are on the cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&rsquo;est juste: buvez, donc, Monsieur Giraumont!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause, and again Gawtrey&rsquo;s deep voice was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wear a wig, I think, Monsieur Giraumont? To judge by your eyelashes
      your own hair has been a handsomer colour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We seek disguise, not beauty, my host; and the police have sharp eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&rsquo;est juste: buvez, donc-vieux Renard! When did we two meet last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ce n&rsquo;est pas vrai! buvez, donc, MONSIEUR FAVART!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of that name the company started in dismay and confusion, and
      the police officer, forgetting himself for the moment, sprang from his
      seat, and put his right hand into his blouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, there!&mdash;treason!&rdquo; cried Gawtrey, in a voice of thunder; and he
      caught the unhappy man by the throat. It was the work of a moment. Morton,
      where he sat, beheld a struggle&mdash;he heard a death-cry. He saw the
      huge form of the master-coiner rising above all the rest, as cutlasses
      gleamed and eyes sparkled round. He saw the quivering and powerless frame
      of the unhappy guest raised aloft in those mighty arms, and presently it
      was hurled along the table-bottles crashing&mdash;the board shaking
      beneath its weight&mdash;and lay before the very eyes of Morton, a
      distorted and lifeless mass. At the same instant Gawtrey sprang upon the
      table, his black frown singling out from the group the ashen, cadaverous
      face of the shrinking traitor. Birnie had darted from the table&mdash;he
      was half-way towards the sliding door&mdash;his face, turned over his
      shoulder, met the eyes of the chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil!&rdquo; shouted Gawtrey, in his terrible voice, which the echoes of the
      vault gave back from side to side. &ldquo;Did I not give thee up my soul that
      thou mightest not compass my death? Hark ye! thus die my slavery and all
      our secrets!&rdquo; The explosion of his pistol half swallowed up the last word,
      and with a single groan the traitor fell on the floor, pierced through the
      brain&mdash;then there was a dead and grim hush as the smoke rolled slowly
      along the roof of the dreary vault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton sank back on his seat, and covered his face with his hands. The
      last seal on the fate of THE MAN OF CRIME was set; the last wave in the
      terrible and mysterious tide of his destiny had dashed on his soul to the
      shore whence there is no return. Vain, now and henceforth, the humour, the
      sentiment, the kindly impulse, the social instincts which had invested
      that stalwart shape with dangerous fascination, which had implied the hope
      of ultimate repentance, of redemption even in this world. The HOUR and the
      CIRCUMSTANCE had seized their prey; and the self-defence, which a lawless
      career rendered a necessity, left the eternal die of blood upon his doom!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, I have saved you,&rdquo; said Gawtrey, slowly gazing on the corpse of
      his second victim, while he turned the pistol to his belt. &ldquo;I have not
      quailed before this man&rsquo;s eye&rdquo; (and he spurned the clay of the officer as
      he spoke with a revengeful scorn) &ldquo;without treasuring up its aspect in my
      heart of hearts. I knew him when he entered&mdash;knew him through his
      disguise&mdash;yet, faith, it was a clever one! Turn up his face and gaze
      on him now; he will never terrify us again, unless there be truth in
      ghosts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murmuring and tremulous the coiners scrambled on the table and examined
      the dead man. From this task Gawtrey interrupted them, for his quick eye
      detected, with the pistols under the policeman&rsquo;s blouse, a whistle of
      metal of curious construction, and he conjectured at once that danger was
      at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have saved you, I say, but only for the hour. This deed cannot sleep.
      See, he had help within call! The police knew where to look for their
      comrade&mdash;we are dispersed. Each for himself. Quick, divide the
      spoils! Sauve qui peat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Morton heard where he sat, his hands still clasped before his face, a
      confused hubbub of voices, the jingle of money, the scrambling of feet,
      the creaking of doors. All was silent!
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong grasp drew his hands from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your first scene of life against life,&rdquo; said Gawtrey&rsquo;s voice, which
      seemed fearfully changed to the ear that heard it. &ldquo;Bah! what would you
      think of a battle? Come to our eyrie: the carcasses are gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton looked fearfully round the vault. He and Gawtrey were alone. His
      eyes sought the places where the dead had lain&mdash;they were removed&mdash;no
      vestige of the deeds, not even a drop of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, take up your cutlass, come!&rdquo; repeated the voice of the chief, as
      with his dim lantern&mdash;now the sole light of the vault&mdash;he stood
      in the shadow of the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton rose, took up the weapon mechanically, and followed that terrible
      guide, mute and unconscious, as a Soul follows a Dream through the House
      of Sleep!
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Sleep no more!&rdquo;&mdash;Macbeth
</pre>
    <p>
      After winding through gloomy and labyrinthine passages, which conducted to
      a different range of cellars from those entered by the unfortunate Favart,
      Gawtrey emerged at the foot of a flight of stairs, which, dark, narrow,
      and in many places broken, had been probably appropriated to servants of
      the house in its days of palmier glory. By these steps the pair regained
      their attic. Gawtrey placed the lantern on the table and seated himself in
      silence. Morton, who had recovered his self-possession and formed his
      resolution, gazed on him for some moments, equally taciturn. At length he
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawtrey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bade you not call me by that name,&rdquo; said the coiner; for we need
      scarcely say that in his new trade he had assumed a new appellation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the least guilty one by which I have known you,&rdquo; returned Morton,
      firmly. &ldquo;It is for the last time I call you by it! I demanded to see by
      what means one to whom I had entrusted my fate supported himself. I have
      seen,&rdquo; continued the young man, still firmly, but with a livid cheek and
      lip, &ldquo;and the tie between us is rent for ever. Interrupt me not! it is not
      for me to blame you. I have eaten of your bread and drunk of your cup.
      Confiding in you too blindly, and believing that you were at least free
      from those dark and terrible crimes for which there is no expiation&mdash;at
      least in this life&mdash;my conscience seared by distress, my very soul
      made dormant by despair, I surrendered myself to one leading a career
      equivocal, suspicious, dishonourable perhaps, but still not, as I
      believed, of atrocity and bloodshed. I wake at the brink of the abyss&mdash;my
      mother&rsquo;s hand beckons to me from the grave; I think I hear her voice while
      I address you&mdash;I recede while it is yet time&mdash;we part, and for
      ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey, whose stormy passion was still deep upon his soul, had listened
      hitherto in sullen and dogged silence, with a gloomy frown on his knitted
      brow; he now rose with an oath&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part! that I may let loose on the world a new traitor! Part! when you
      have seen me fresh from an act that, once whispered, gives me to the
      guillotine! Part&mdash;never! at least alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said it,&rdquo; said Morton, folding his arms calmly; &ldquo;I say it to your
      face, though I might part from you in secret. Frown not on me, man of
      blood! I am fearless as yourself! In another minute I am gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is it so?&rdquo; said Gawtrey; and glancing round the room, which contained
      two doors, the one concealed by the draperies of a bed, communicating with
      the stairs by which they had entered, the other with the landing of the
      principal and common flight: he turned to the former, within his reach,
      which he locked, and put the key into his pocket, and then, throwing
      across the latter a heavy swing bar, which fell into its socket with a
      harsh noise,&mdash;before the threshold he placed his vast bulk, and burst
      into his loud, fierce laugh: &ldquo;Ho! ho! Slave and fool, once mine, you were
      mine body and soul for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tempter, I defy you! stand back!&rdquo; And, firm and dauntless, Morton laid
      his hand on the giant&rsquo;s vest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey seemed more astonished than enraged. He looked hard at his daring
      associate, on whose lip the down was yet scarcely dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;off! do not rouse the devil in me again! I could crush
      you with a hug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul supports my body, and I am armed,&rdquo; said Morton, laying hand on
      his cutlass. &ldquo;But you dare not harm me, nor I you; bloodstained as you
      are, you gave me shelter and bread; but accuse me not that I will save my
      soul while it is yet time!&mdash;Shall my mother have blessed me in vain
      upon her death-bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey drew back, and Morton, by a sudden impulse, grasped his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! hear me&mdash;hear me!&rdquo; he cried, with great emotion. &ldquo;Abandon this
      horrible career; you have been decoyed and betrayed to it by one who can
      deceive or terrify you no more! Abandon it, and I will never desert you.
      For her sake&mdash;for your Fanny&rsquo;s sake&mdash;pause, like me, before the
      gulf swallow us. Let us fly!&mdash;far to the New World&mdash;to any land
      where our thews and sinews, our stout hands and hearts, can find an honest
      mart. Men, desperate as we are, have yet risen by honest means. Take her,
      your orphan, with us. We will work for her, both of us. Gawtrey! hear me.
      It is not my voice that speaks to you&mdash;it is your good angel&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey fell back against the wall, and his chest heaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morton,&rdquo; he said, with choked and tremulous accent, &ldquo;go now; leave me to
      my fate! I have sinned against you&mdash;shamefully sinned. It seemed to
      me so sweet to have a friend; in your youth and character of mind there
      was so much about which the tough strings of my heart wound themselves,
      that I could not bear to lose you&mdash;to suffer you to know me for what
      I was. I blinded&mdash;I deceived you as to my past deeds; that was base
      in me: but I swore to my own heart to keep you unexposed to every danger,
      and free from every vice that darkened my own path. I kept that oath till
      this night, when, seeing that you began to recoil from me, and dreading
      that you should desert me, I thought to bind you to me for ever by
      implicating you in this fellowship of crime. I am punished, and justly.
      Go, I repeat&mdash;leave me to the fate that strides nearer and nearer to
      me day by day. You are a boy still&mdash;I am no longer young. Habit is a
      second nature. Still&mdash;still I could repent&mdash;I could begin life
      again. But repose!&mdash;to look back&mdash;to remember&mdash;to be
      haunted night and day with deeds that shall meet me bodily and face to
      face on the last day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Add not to the spectres! Come&mdash;fly this night&mdash;this hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey paused, irresolute and wavering, when at that moment he heard
      steps on the stairs below. He started&mdash;as starts the boar caught in
      his lair&mdash;and listened, pale and breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&mdash;they are on us!&mdash;they come!&rdquo; as he whispered, the key
      from without turned in the wards&mdash;the door shook. &ldquo;Soft! the bar
      preserves us both&mdash;this way.&rdquo; And the coiner crept to the door of the
      private stairs. He unlocked and opened it cautiously. A man sprang through
      the aperture:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yield!&mdash;you are my prisoner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Gawtrey, hurling back the intruder, and clapping to the
      door, though other and stout men were pressing against it with all their
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! Who shall open the tiger&rsquo;s cage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At both doors now were heard the sound of voices. &ldquo;Open in the king&rsquo;s
      name, or expect no mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; said Gawtrey. &ldquo;One way yet&mdash;the window&mdash;the rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton opened the casement&mdash;Gawtrey uncoiled the rope. The dawn was
      breaking; it was light in the streets, but all seemed quiet without. The
      doors reeled and shook beneath the pressure of the pursuers. Gawtrey flung
      the rope across the street to the opposite parapet; after two or three
      efforts, the grappling-hook caught firm hold&mdash;the perilous path was
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On!&mdash;quick!&mdash;loiter not!&rdquo; whispered Gawtrey; &ldquo;you are active&mdash;it
      seems more dangerous than it is&mdash;cling with both hands&mdash;shut
      your eyes. When on the other side&mdash;you see the window of Birnie&rsquo;s
      room,&mdash;enter it&mdash;descend the stairs&mdash;let yourself out, and
      you are safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go first,&rdquo; said Morton, in the same tone: &ldquo;I will not leave you now: you
      will be longer getting across than I shall. I will keep guard till you are
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! hark!&mdash;are you mad? You keep guard! what is your strength to
      mine? Twenty men shall not move that door, while my weight is against it.
      Quick, or you destroy us both! Besides, you will hold the rope for me, it
      may not be strong enough for my bulk in itself. Stay!&mdash;stay one
      moment. If you escape, and I fall&mdash;Fanny&mdash;my father, he will
      take care of her,&mdash;you remember&mdash;thanks! Forgive me all! Go;
      that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a firm impulse, Morton threw himself on the dreadful bridge; it swung
      and crackled at his weight. Shifting his grasp rapidly&mdash;holding his
      breath&mdash;with set teeth-with closed eyes&mdash;he moved on&mdash;he
      gained the parapet&mdash;he stood safe on the opposite side. And now,
      straining his eyes across, he saw through the open casement into the
      chamber he had just quitted. Gawtrey was still standing against the door
      to the principal staircase, for that of the two was the weaker and the
      more assailed. Presently the explosion of a fire-arm was heard; they had
      shot through the panel. Gawtrey seemed wounded, for he staggered forward,
      and uttered a fierce cry; a moment more, and he gained the window&mdash;he
      seized the rope&mdash;he hung over the tremendous depth! Morton knelt by
      the parapet, holding the grappling-hook in its place, with convulsive
      grasp, and fixing his eyes, bloodshot with fear and suspense, on the huge
      bulk that clung for life to that slender cord!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le voiles! Le voiles!&rdquo; cried a voice from the opposite side. Morton
      raised his gaze from Gawtrey; the casement was darkened by the forms of
      his pursuers&mdash;they had burst into the room&mdash;an officer sprang
      upon the parapet, and Gawtrey, now aware of his danger, opened his eyes,
      and as he moved on, glared upon the foe. The policeman deliberately raised
      his pistol&mdash;Gawtrey arrested himself&mdash;from a wound in his side
      the blood trickled slowly and darkly down, drop by drop, upon the stones
      below; even the officers of law shuddered as they eyed him&mdash;his hair
      bristling&mdash;his cheek white&mdash;his lips drawn convulsively from his
      teeth, and his eyes glaring from beneath the frown of agony and menace in
      which yet spoke the indomitable power and fierceness of the man. His look,
      so fixed&mdash;so intense&mdash;so stern, awed the policeman; his hand
      trembled as he fired, and the ball struck the parapet an inch below the
      spot where Morton knelt. An indistinct, wild, gurgling sound-half-laugh,
      half-yell of scorn and glee, broke from Gawtrey&rsquo;s lips. He swung himself
      on&mdash;near&mdash;near&mdash;nearer&mdash;a yard from the parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are saved!&rdquo; cried Morton; when at the moment a volley burst from the
      fatal casement&mdash;the smoke rolled over both the fugitives&mdash;a
      groan, or rather howl, of rage, and despair, and agony, appalled even the
      hardest on whose ear it came. Morton sprang to his feet and looked below.
      He saw on the rugged stones far down, a dark, formless, motionless mass&mdash;the
      strong man of passion and levity&mdash;the giant who had played with life
      and soul, as an infant with the baubles that it prizes and breaks&mdash;was
      what the Caesar and the leper alike are, when the clay is without God&rsquo;s
      breath&mdash;what glory, genius, power, and beauty, would be for ever and
      for ever, if there were no God!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another!&rdquo; cried the voice of one of the pursuers. &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Gawtrey!&rdquo; muttered Philip. &ldquo;I will fulfil your last wish;&rdquo; and
      scarcely conscious of the bullet that whistled by him, he disappeared
      behind the parapet.

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;Gently moved
     By the soft wind of whispering silks.&rdquo;&mdash;DECKER.
</pre>
    <p>
      The reader may remember that while Monsieur Favart and Mr. Birnie were
      holding commune in the lane, the sounds of festivity were heard from a
      house in the adjoining street. To that house we are now summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Paris, the gaieties of balls, or soirees, are, I believe, very rare in
      that period of the year in which they are most frequent in London. The
      entertainment now given was in honour of a christening; the lady who gave
      it, a relation of the new-born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Merville was a young widow; even before her marriage she had
      been distinguished in literature; she had written poems of more than
      common excellence; and being handsome, of good family, and large fortune,
      her talents made her an object of more interest than they might otherwise
      have done. Her poetry showed great sensibility and tenderness. If poetry
      be any index to the heart, you would have thought her one to love truly
      and deeply. Nevertheless, since she married&mdash;as girls in France do&mdash;not
      to please herself, but her parents, she made a mariage de convenance.
      Monsieur de Merville was a sober, sensible man, past middle age. Not being
      fond of poetry, and by no means coveting a professional author for his
      wife, he had during their union, which lasted four years, discouraged his
      wife&rsquo;s liaison with Apollo. But her mind, active and ardent, did not the
      less prey upon itself. At the age of four-and-twenty she became a widow,
      with an income large even in England for a single woman, and at Paris
      constituting no ordinary fortune. Madame de Merville, however, though a
      person of elegant taste, was neither ostentatious nor selfish; she had no
      children, and she lived quietly in apartments, handsome, indeed, but not
      more than adequate to the small establishment which&mdash;where, as on the
      Continent, the costly convenience of an entire house is not usually
      incurred&mdash;sufficed for her retinue. She devoted at least half her
      income, which was entirely at her own disposal, partly to the aid of her
      own relations, who were not rich, and partly to the encouragement of the
      literature she cultivated. Although she shrank from the ordeal of
      publication, her poems and sketches of romance were read to her own
      friends, and possessed an eloquence seldom accompanied with so much
      modesty. Thus, her reputation, though not blown about the winds, was high
      in her own circle, and her position in fashion and in fortune made her
      looked up to by her relations as the head of her family; they regarded her
      as femme superieure, and her advice with them was equivalent to a command.
      Eugenie de Merville was a strange mixture of qualities at once feminine
      and masculine. On the one hand, she had a strong will, independent views,
      some contempt for the world, and followed her own inclinations without
      servility to the opinion of others; on the other hand, she was
      susceptible, romantic, of a sweet, affectionate, kind disposition. Her
      visit to M. Love, however indiscreet, was not less in accordance with her
      character than her charity to the mechanic&rsquo;s wife; masculine and careless
      where an eccentric thing was to be done&mdash;curiosity satisfied, or some
      object in female diplomacy achieved&mdash;womanly, delicate, and gentle,
      the instant her benevolence was appealed to or her heart touched. She had
      now been three years a widow, and was consequently at the age of
      twenty-seven. Despite the tenderness of her poetry and her character, her
      reputation was unblemished. She had never been in love. People who are
      much occupied do not fall in love easily; besides, Madame de Merville was
      refining, exacting, and wished to find heroes where she only met handsome
      dandies or ugly authors. Moreover, Eugenie was both a vain and a proud
      person&mdash;vain of her celebrity and proud of her birth. She was one
      whose goodness of heart made her always active in promoting the happiness
      of others. She was not only generous and charitable, but willing to serve
      people by good offices as well as money. Everybody loved her. The new-born
      infant, to whose addition to the Christian community the fete of this
      night was dedicated, was the pledge of a union which Madame de Merville
      had managed to effect between two young persons, first cousins to each
      other, and related to herself. There had been scruples of parents to
      remove&mdash;money matters to adjust&mdash;Eugenie had smoothed all. The
      husband and wife, still lovers, looked up to her as the author, under
      Heaven, of their happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gala of that night had been, therefore, of a nature more than usually
      pleasurable, and the mirth did not sound hollow, but wrung from the heart.
      Yet, as Eugenie from time to time contemplated the young people, whose
      eyes ever sought each other&mdash;so fair, so tender, and so joyous as
      they seemed&mdash;a melancholy shadow darkened her brow, and she sighed
      involuntarily. Once the young wife, Madame d&rsquo;Anville, approaching her
      timidly, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my sweet cousin, when shall we see you as happy as ourselves? There
      is such happiness,&rdquo; she added, innocently, and with a blush, &ldquo;in being a
      mother!&mdash;that little life all one&rsquo;s own&mdash;it is something to
      think of every hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Eugenie, smiling, and seeking to turn the conversation
      from a subject that touched too nearly upon feelings and thoughts her
      pride did not wish to reveal&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps it is you, then, who have made
      our cousin, poor Monsieur de Vaudemont, so determined to marry? Pray, be
      more cautious with him. How difficult I have found it to prevent his
      bringing into our family some one to make us all ridiculous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Anville, laughing. &ldquo;But then, the Vicomte is so
      poor, and in debt. He would fall in love, not with the demoiselle, but the
      dower. A propos of that, how cleverly you took advantage of his boastful
      confession to break off his liaisons with that bureau de mariage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I congratulate myself on that manoeuvre. Unpleasant as it was to go
      to such a place (for, of course, I could not send for Monsieur Love here),
      it would have been still more unpleasant to have received such a Madame de
      Vaudemont as our cousin would have presented to us. Only think&mdash;he
      was the rival of an epicier! I heard that there was some curious
      denouement to the farce of that establishment; but I could never get from
      Vaudemont the particulars. He was ashamed of them, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What droll professions there are in Paris!&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Anville. &ldquo;As if
      people could not marry without going to an office for a spouse as we go
      for a servant! And so the establishment is broken up? And you never again
      saw that dark, wild-looking boy who so struck your fancy that you have
      taken him as the original for the Murillo sketch of the youth in that
      charming tale you read to us the other evening? Ah! cousin, I think you
      were a little taken with him. The bureau de mariage had its allurements
      for you as well as for our poor cousin!&rdquo; The young mother said this
      laughingly and carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; returned Madame de Merville, laughing also; but a slight blush
      broke over her natural paleness. &ldquo;But a propos of the Vicomte. You know
      how cruelly he has behaved to that poor boy of his by his English wife&mdash;never
      seen him since he was an infant&mdash;kept him at some school in England;
      and all because his vanity does not like the world to know that he has a
      son of nineteen! Well, I have induced him to recall this poor youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! and how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Eugenie, with a smile, &ldquo;he wanted a loan, poor man, and I
      could therefore impose conditions by way of interest. But I also managed
      to conciliate him to the proposition, by representing that, if the young
      man were good-looking, he might, himself, with our connections, &amp;c.,
      form an advantageous marriage; and that in such a case, if the father
      treated him now justly and kindly, he would naturally partake with the
      father whatever benefits the marriage might confer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are an excellent diplomatist, Eugenie; and you turn people&rsquo;s
      heads by always acting from your heart. Hush! here comes the Vicomte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A delightful ball,&rdquo; said Monsieur de Vaudemont, approaching the hostess.
      &ldquo;Pray, has that young lady yonder, in the pink dress, any fortune? She is
      pretty&mdash;eh? You observe she is looking at me&mdash;I mean at us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear cousin, what a compliment you pay to marriage! You have had two
      wives, and you are ever on the qui vive for a third!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have me do?&mdash;we cannot resist the overtures of your
      bewitching sex. Hum&mdash;what fortune has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a sou; besides, she is engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! now I look at her, she is not pretty&mdash;not at all. I made a
      mistake. I did not mean her; I meant the young lady in blue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse and worse&mdash;she is married already. Shall I present you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur de Vaudemont,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Anville; &ldquo;have you found out a
      new bureau de mariage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Vicomte pretended not to hear that question. But, turning to Eugenie,
      took her aside, and said, with an air in which he endeavoured to throw a
      great deal of sorrow, &ldquo;You know, my dear cousin, that, to oblige you, I
      consented to send for my son, though, as I always said, it is very
      unpleasant for a man like me, in the prime of life, to hawk about a great
      boy of nineteen or twenty. People soon say, &lsquo;Old Vaudemont and younq
      Vaudemont.&rsquo; However, a father&rsquo;s feelings are never appealed to in vain.&rdquo;
       (Here the Vicomte put his handkerchief to his eyes, and after a pause,
      continued,)&mdash;&ldquo;I sent for him&mdash;I even went to your old bonne,
      Madame Dufour, to make a bargain for her lodgings, and this day&mdash;guess
      my grief&mdash;I received a letter sealed with black. My son is dead!&mdash;a
      sudden fever&mdash;it is shocking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible! dead!&mdash;your own son, whom you hardly ever saw&mdash;never
      since he was an Infant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that softens the blow very much. And now you see I must marry. If
      the boy had been good-looking, and like me, and so forth, why, as you
      observed, he might have made a good match, and allowed me a certain sum,
      or we could have all lived together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your son is dead, and you come to a ball!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Je suis philosophe,&rdquo; said the Vicomte, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;And, as
      you say, I never saw him. It saves me seven hundred francs a-year. Don&rsquo;t
      say a word to any one&mdash;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t give out that he is dead, poor
      fellow! Pray be discreet: you see there are some ill-natured people who
      might think it odd I do not shut myself up. I can wait till Paris is quite
      empty. It would be a pity to lose any opportunity at present, for now, you
      see, I must marry!&rdquo; And the philosophe sauntered away.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          GUIOMAR.
     &ldquo;Those devotions I am to pay
     Are written in my heart, not in this book.&rdquo;
 
         Enter RUTILIO.
     &ldquo;I am pursued&mdash;all the ports are stopped too,
     Not any hope to escape&mdash;behind, before me,
     On either side, I am beset.&rdquo;
      BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER, The Custom of the Country
</pre>
    <p>
      The party were just gone&mdash;it was already the peep of day&mdash;the
      wheels of the last carriage had died in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Merville had dismissed her woman, and was seated in her own
      room, leaning her head musingly on her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside her was the table that held her MSS. and a few books, amidst which
      were scattered vases of flowers. On a pedestal beneath the window was
      placed a marble bust of Dante. Through the open door were seen in
      perspective two rooms just deserted by her guests; the lights still burned
      in the chandeliers and girandoles, contending with the daylight that came
      through the half-closed curtains. The person of the inmate was in harmony
      with the apartment. It was characterised by a certain grace which, for
      want of a better epithet, writers are prone to call classical or antique.
      Her complexion, seeming paler than usual by that light, was yet soft and
      delicate&mdash;the features well cut, but small and womanly. About the
      face there was that rarest of all charms, the combination of intellect
      with sweetness; the eyes, of a dark blue, were thoughtful, perhaps
      melancholy, in their expression; but the long dark lashes, and the shape
      of the eyes, themselves more long than full, gave to their intelligence a
      softness approaching to languor, increased, perhaps, by that slight shadow
      round and below the orbs which is common with those who have tasked too
      much either the mind or the heart. The contour of the face, without being
      sharp or angular, had yet lost a little of the roundness of earlier youth;
      and the hand on which she leaned was, perhaps, even too white, too
      delicate, for the beauty which belongs to health; but the throat and bust
      were of exquisite symmetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not happy,&rdquo; murmured Eugenie to herself; &ldquo;yet I scarce know why. Is
      it really, as we women of romance have said till the saying is worn
      threadbare, that the destiny of women is not fame but love. Strange, then,
      that while I have so often pictured what love should be, I have never felt
      it. And now,&mdash;and now,&rdquo; she continued, half rising, and with a
      natural pang&mdash;&ldquo;now I am no longer in my first youth. If I loved,
      should I be loved again? How happy the young pair seemed&mdash;they are
      never alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, at a distance, was heard the report of fire-arms&mdash;again!
      Eugenie started, and called to her servant, who, with one of the waiters
      hired for the night, was engaged in removing, and nibbling as he removed,
      the remains of the feast. &ldquo;What is that, at this hour?&mdash;open the
      window and look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see nothing, madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again&mdash;that is the third time. Go into the street and look&mdash;some
      one must be in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant and the waiter, both curious, and not willing to part company,
      ran down the stairs, and thence into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Morton, after vainly attempting Birnie&rsquo;s window, which the
      traitor had previously locked and barred against the escape of his
      intended victim, crept rapidly along the roof, screened by the parapet not
      only from the shot but the sight of the foe. But just as he gained the
      point at which the lane made an angle with the broad street it adjoined,
      he cast his eyes over the parapet, and perceived that one of the officers
      had ventured himself to the fearful bridge; he was pursued&mdash;detection
      and capture seemed inevitable. He paused, and breathed hard. He, once the
      heir to such fortunes, the darling of such affections!&mdash;he, the
      hunted accomplice of a gang of miscreants! That was the thought that
      paralysed&mdash;the disgrace, not the danger. But he was in advance of the
      pursuer&mdash;he hastened on&mdash;he turned the angle&mdash;he heard a
      shout behind from the opposite side&mdash;the officer had passed the
      bridge: &ldquo;it is but one man as yet,&rdquo; thought he, and his nostrils dilated
      and his hands clenched as he glided on, glancing at each casement as he
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as youth and vigour thus struggled against Law for life, near at hand
      Death was busy with toil and disease. In a miserable grabat, or garret, a
      mechanic, yet young, and stricken by a lingering malady contracted by the
      labour of his occupation, was slowly passing from that world which had
      frowned on his cradle, and relaxed not the gloom of its aspect to comfort
      his bed of Death. Now this man had married for love, and his wife had
      loved him; and it was the cares of that early marriage which had consumed
      him to the bone. But extreme want, if long continued, eats up love when it
      has nothing else to eat. And when people are very long dying, the people
      they fret and trouble begin to think of that too often hypocritical
      prettiness of phrase called &ldquo;a happy release.&rdquo; So the worn-out and
      half-famished wife did not care three straws for the dying husband, whom a
      year or two ago she had vowed to love and cherish in sickness and in
      health. But still she seemed to care, for she moaned, and pined, and wept,
      as the man&rsquo;s breath grew fainter and fainter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Jean!&rdquo; said she, sobbing, &ldquo;what will become of me, a poor lone widow,
      with nobody to work for my bread?&rdquo; And with that thought she took on worse
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am stifling,&rdquo; said the dying man, rolling round his ghastly eyes. &ldquo;How
      hot it is! Open the window; I should like to see the light&mdash;daylight
      once again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! what whims he has, poor man!&rdquo; muttered the woman, without
      stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor wretch put out his skeleton hand and clutched his wife&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t trouble you long, Marie! Air&mdash;air!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean, you will make yourself worse&mdash;besides, I shall catch my death
      of cold. I have scarce a rag on, but I will just open the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; groaned the sufferer; &ldquo;leave me, then.&rdquo; Poor fellow! perhaps
      at that moment the thought of unkindness was sharper than the sharp cough
      which brought blood at every paroxysm. He did not like her so near him,
      but he did not blame her. Again, I say,&mdash;poor fellow! The woman
      opened the door, went to the other side of the room, and sat down on an
      old box and began darning an old neck-handkerchief. The silence was soon
      broken by the moans of the fast-dying man, and again he muttered, as he
      tossed to and fro, with baked white lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Je m&rsquo;etoufee!&mdash;Air!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting that prayer, it seemed so like the last. The wife
      laid down the needle, put the handkerchief round her throat, and opened
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you feel easier now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, Marie&mdash;yes; that&rsquo;s good&mdash;good. It puts me in mind of
      old days, that breath of air, before we came to Paris. I wish I could work
      for you now, Marie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean! my poor Jean!&rdquo; said the woman, and the words and the voice took
      back her hardening heart to the fresh fields and tender thoughts of the
      past time. And she walked up to the bed, and he leaned his temples, damp
      with livid dews, upon her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been a sad burden to you, Marie; we should not have married so
      soon; but I thought I was stronger. Don&rsquo;t cry; we have no little ones,
      thank God. It will be much better for you when I am gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, word after word gasped out&mdash;he stopped suddenly, and seemed
      to fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife then attempted gently to lay him once more on his pillow&mdash;the
      head fell back heavily&mdash;the jaw had dropped&mdash;the teeth were set&mdash;the
      eyes were open and like the stone&mdash;the truth broke on her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean&mdash;Jean! My God, he is dead! and I was unkind to him at the
      last!&rdquo; With these words she fell upon the corpse, happily herself
      insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment a human face peered in at the window. Through that
      aperture, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, a young man leaped lightly into the
      room. He looked round with a hurried glance, but scarcely noticed the
      forms stretched on the pallet. It was enough for him that they seemed to
      sleep, and saw him not. He stole across the room, the door of which Marie
      had left open, and descended the stairs. He had almost gained the
      courtyard into which the stairs had conducted, when he heard voices below
      by the porter&rsquo;s lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The police have discovered a gang of coiners!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coiners!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one has been shot dead! I have seen his body in the kennel; another
      has fled along the roofs&mdash;a desperate fellow! We were to watch for
      him. Let us go up-stairs and get on the roof and look out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the hum of approval that followed this proposition, Morton judged
      rightly that it had been addressed to several persons whom curiosity and
      the explosion of the pistols had drawn from their beds, and who were
      grouped round the porter&rsquo;s lodge. What was to be done?&mdash;to advance
      was impossible: and was there yet time to retreat?&mdash;it was at least
      the only course left him; he sprang back up the stairs; he had just gained
      the first flight when he heard steps descending; then, suddenly, it
      flashed across him that he had left open the window above&mdash;that,
      doubtless, by that imprudent oversight the officer in pursuit had detected
      a clue to the path he had taken. What was to be done?&mdash;die as Gawtrey
      had done!&mdash;death rather than the galleys. As he thus resolved, he saw
      to the right the open door of an apartment in which lights still glimmered
      in their sockets. It seemed deserted&mdash;he entered boldly and at once,
      closing the door after him. Wines and viands still left on the table;
      gilded mirrors, reflecting the stern face of the solitary intruder; here
      and there an artificial flower, a knot of riband on the floor, all
      betokening the gaieties and graces of luxurious life&mdash;the dance, the
      revel, the feast&mdash;all this in one apartment!&mdash;above, in the same
      house, the pallet&mdash;the corpse&mdash;the widow&mdash;famine and woe!
      Such is a great city! such, above all, is Paris! where, under the same
      roof, are gathered such antagonist varieties of the social state! Nothing
      strange in this; it is strange and sad that so little do people thus
      neighbours know of each other, that the owner of those rooms had a heart
      soft to every distress, but she did not know the distress so close at
      hand. The music that had charmed her guests had mounted gaily to the vexed
      ears of agony and hunger. Morton passed the first room&mdash;a second&mdash;he
      came to a third, and Eugenie de Merville, looking up at that instant, saw
      before her an apparition that might well have alarmed the boldest. His
      head was uncovered&mdash;his dark hair shadowed in wild and disorderly
      profusion the pale face and features, beautiful indeed, but at that moment
      of the beauty which an artist would impart to a young gladiator&mdash;stamped
      with defiance, menace, and despair. The disordered garb&mdash;the fierce
      aspect&mdash;the dark eyes, that literally shone through the shadows of
      the room&mdash;all conspired to increase the terror of so abrupt a
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you?&mdash;What do you seek here?&rdquo; said she, falteringly,
      placing her hand on the bell as she spoke. Upon that soft hand Morton laid
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seek my life! I am pursued! I am at your mercy! I am innocent! Can you
      save me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the door of the outer room beyond was heard to open, and
      steps and voices were at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, recoiling as he recognised her face. &ldquo;And is it to you
      that I have fled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie also recognised the stranger; and there was something in their
      relative positions&mdash;the suppliant, the protectress&mdash;that excited
      both her imagination and her pity. A slight colour mantled to her cheeks&mdash;her
      look was gentle and compassionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy! so young!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew her hand from his, retired a few steps, lifted a curtain
      drawn across a recess&mdash;and pointing to an alcove that contained one
      of those sofa-beds common in French houses, added in a whisper,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter&mdash;you are saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morton obeyed, and Eugenie replaced the curtain.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
             GUIOMAR.
     &ldquo;Speak! What are you?&rdquo;
 
            RUTILIO.
     &ldquo;Gracious woman, hear me. I am a stranger:
     And in that I answer all your demands.&rdquo;
       Custom of the Country.
</pre>
    <p>
      Eugenie replaced the curtain. And scarcely had she done so ere the steps
      in the outer room entered the chamber where she stood. Her servant was
      accompanied by two officers of the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, madame,&rdquo; said one of the latter; &ldquo;but we are in pursuit of a
      criminal. We think he must have entered this house through a window above
      while your servant was in the street. Permit us to search?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; answered Eugenie, seating herself. &ldquo;If he has entered,
      look in the other apartments. I have not quitted this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right. Accept our apologies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the officers turned back to examine every corner where the fugitive
      was not. For in that, the scouts of Justice resembled their mistress: when
      does man&rsquo;s justice look to the right place?
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant lingered to repeat the tale he had heard&mdash;the sight he
      had seen. When, at that instant, he saw the curtain of the alcove slightly
      stirred. He uttered an exclamation&mdash;sprung to the bed&mdash;his hand
      touched the curtain&mdash;Eugenie seized his arm. She did not speak; but
      as he turned his eyes to her, astonished, he saw that she trembled, and
      that her cheek was as white as marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, hesitating, &ldquo;there is some one hid in the recess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is! Be silent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A suspicion flashed across the servant&rsquo;s mind. The pure, the proud, the
      immaculate Eugenie!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is!&mdash;and in madame&rsquo;s chamber!&rdquo; he faltered unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie&rsquo;s quick apprehensions seized the foul thought. Her eyes flashed&mdash;her
      cheek crimsoned. But her lofty and generous nature conquered even the
      indignant and scornful burst that rushed to her lips. The truth!&mdash;could
      she trust the man? A doubt&mdash;and the charge of the human life rendered
      to her might be betrayed. Her colour fell&mdash;tears gushed to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been kind to you, Francois. Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame confides in me&mdash;it is enough,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, bowing,
      with a slight smile on his lips; and he drew back respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the police officers re-entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have done, madame; he is not here. Aha! that curtain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is madame&rsquo;s bed,&rdquo; said Francois. &ldquo;But I have looked behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am most sorry to have disarranged you,&rdquo; said the policeman, satisfied
      with the answer; &ldquo;but we shall have him yet.&rdquo; And he retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last footsteps died away, the last door of the apartments closed
      behind the officers, and Eugenie and her servant stood alone gazing on
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may retire,&rdquo; said she at last; and taking her purse from the table,
      she placed it in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took it, with a significant look. &ldquo;Madame may depend on my
      discretion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie was alone again. Those words rang in her ear,&mdash;Eugenie de
      Merville dependent on the discretion of her lackey! She sunk into her
      chair, and, her excitement succeeded by exhaustion, leaned her face on her
      hands, and burst into tears. She was aroused by a low voice; she looked
      up, and the young man was kneeling at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go&mdash;go!&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;I have done for you all I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard&mdash;you heard&mdash;my own hireling, too! At the hazard of my
      own good name you are saved. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your good name!&rdquo;&mdash;for Eugenie forgot that it was looks, not
      words, that had so wrung her pride&mdash;&ldquo;Your good name,&rdquo; he repeated:
      and glancing round the room&mdash;the toilette, the curtain, the recess he
      had quitted&mdash;all that bespoke that chastest sanctuary of a chaste
      woman, which for a stranger to enter is, as it were, to profane&mdash;her
      meaning broke on him. &ldquo;Your good name&mdash;your hireling! No, madame,&mdash;no!&rdquo;
       And as he spoke, he rose to his feet. &ldquo;Not for me, that sacrifice! Your
      humanity shall not cost you so dear. Ho, there! I am the man you seek.&rdquo;
       And he strode to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie was penetrated with the answer. She sprung to him&mdash;she
      grasped his garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush!&mdash;for mercy&rsquo;s sake! What would you do? Think you I could
      ever be happy again, if the confidence you placed in me were betrayed? Be
      calm&mdash;be still. I knew not what I said. It will be easy to undeceive
      the man&mdash;later&mdash;when you are saved. And you are innocent,&mdash;are
      you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, madame,&rdquo; said Morton, &ldquo;from my soul I say it, I am innocent&mdash;not
      of poverty&mdash;wretchedness&mdash;error&mdash;shame; I am innocent of
      crime. May Heaven bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he reverently kissed the hand laid on his arm, there was something
      in his voice so touching, in his manner something so above his fortunes,
      that Eugenie was lost in her feelings of compassion, surprise, and
      something, it might be, of admiration in her wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, oh!&rdquo; he said, passionately, gazing on her with his dark, brilliant
      eyes, liquid with emotion, &ldquo;you have made my life sweet in saving it. You&mdash;you&mdash;of
      whom, ever since the first time, almost the sole time, I beheld you&mdash;I
      have so often mused and dreamed. Henceforth, whatever befall me, there
      will be some recollections that will&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, for his heart was too full for words; and the silence
      said more to Eugenie than if all the eloquence of Rousseau had glowed upon
      his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who, and what are you?&rdquo; she asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An exile&mdash;an orphan&mdash;an outcast! I have no name! Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;stay yet&mdash;the danger is not past. Wait till my servant is
      gone to rest; I hear him yet. Sit down&mdash;sit down. And whither would
      you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the police of Paris so vigilant!&rdquo; cried Eugenie, wringing her hands.
      &ldquo;What is to be done? I shall have saved you in vain&mdash;you will be
      discovered! Of what do they charge you? Not robbery&mdash;not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she, too, stopped short, for she did not dare to breathe the black
      word, &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Morton, putting his hand to his forehead, &ldquo;except of
      being friends with the only man who befriended me&mdash;and they have
      killed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time you shall tell me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time!&rdquo; he exclaimed, eagerly&mdash;&ldquo;shall I see you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eugenie blushed beneath the gaze and the voice of joy. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;yes. But I must reflect. Be calm be silent. Ah!&mdash;a happy thought!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down, wrote a hasty line, sealed, and gave it to Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this note, as addressed, to Madame Dufour; it will provide you with
      a safe lodging. She is a person I can depend on&mdash;an old servant who
      lived with my mother, and to whom I have given a small pension. She has a
      lodging&mdash;it is lately vacant&mdash;I promised to procure her a tenant&mdash;go&mdash;say
      nothing of what has passed. I will see her, and arrange all. Wait!&mdash;hark!&mdash;all
      is still. I will go first, and see that no one watches you. Stop,&rdquo; (and
      she threw open the window, and looked into the court.) &ldquo;The porter&rsquo;s door
      is open&mdash;that is fortunate! Hurry on, and God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Morton was in the streets. It was still early&mdash;the
      thoroughfares deserted-none of the shops yet open. The address on the note
      was to a street at some distance, on the other side of the Seine. He
      passed along the same Quai which he had trodden but a few hours since&mdash;he
      passed the same splendid bridge on which he had stood despairing, to quit
      it revived&mdash;he gained the Rue Faubourg St. Honore. A young man in a
      cabriolet, on whose fair cheek burned the hectic of late vigils and lavish
      dissipation, was rolling leisurely home from the gaming-house, at which he
      had been more than usually fortunate&mdash;his pockets were laden with
      notes and gold. He bent forwards as Morton passed him. Philip, absorbed in
      his reverie, perceived him not, and continued his way. The gentleman
      turned down one of the streets to the left, stopped, and called to the
      servant dozing behind his cabriolet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow that passenger! quietly&mdash;see where he lodges; be sure to find
      out and let me know. I shall go home without you.&rdquo; With that he drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, unconscious of the espionage, arrived at a small house in a quiet
      but respectable street, and rang the bell several times before at last he
      was admitted by Madame Dufour herself, in her nightcap. The old woman
      looked askant and alarmed at the unexpected apparition. But the note
      seemed at once to satisfy her. She conducted him to an apartment on the
      first floor, small, but neatly and even elegantly furnished, consisting of
      a sitting-room and a bedchamber, and said, quietly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they suit monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To monsieur they seemed a palace. Morton nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will monsieur sleep for a short time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bed is well aired. The rooms have only been vacant three days since.
      Can I get you anything till your luggage arrives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman left him. He threw off his clothes&mdash;flung himself on the
      bed&mdash;and did not wake till noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his eyes unclosed&mdash;when they rested on that calm chamber, with
      its air of health, and cleanliness, and comfort, it was long before he
      could convince himself that he was yet awake. He missed the loud, deep
      voice of Gawtrey&mdash;the smoke of the dead man&rsquo;s meerschaum&mdash;the
      gloomy garret&mdash;the distained walls&mdash;the stealthy whisper of the
      loathed Birnie; slowly the life led and the life gone within the last
      twelve hours grew upon his struggling memory. He groaned, and turned
      uneasily round, when the door slightly opened, and he sprung up fiercely,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only I, sir,&rdquo; answered Madame Dufour. &ldquo;I have been in three times
      to see if you were stirring. There is a letter I believe for you, sir;
      though there is no name to it,&rdquo; and she laid the letter on the chair
      beside him. Did it come from her&mdash;the saving angel? He seized it. The
      cover was blank; it was sealed with a small device, as of a ring seal. He
      tore it open, and found four billets de banque for 1,000 francs each,&mdash;a
      sum equivalent in our money to about L160.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent this, the&mdash;the lady from whom I brought the note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Merville? certainly not, sir,&rdquo; said Madame Dufour, who, with
      the privilege of age, was now unscrupulously filling the water-jugs and
      settling the toilette-table. &ldquo;A young man called about two hours after you
      had gone to bed; and, describing you, inquired if you lodged here, and
      what your name was. I said you had just arrived, and that I did not yet
      know your name. So he went away, and came again half an hour afterwards
      with this letter, which he charged me to deliver to you safely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man&mdash;a gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he seemed a smart but common sort of lad.&rdquo; For the
      unsophisticated Madame Dufour did not discover in the plain black frock
      and drab gaiters of the bearer of that letter the simple livery of an
      English gentleman&rsquo;s groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whom could it come from, if not from Madame de Merville? Perhaps one of
      Gawtrey&rsquo;s late friends. A suspicion of Arthur Beaufort crossed him, but he
      indignantly dismissed it. Men are seldom credulous of what they are
      unwilling to believe. What kindness had the Beauforts hitherto shown him?&mdash;Left
      his mother to perish broken-hearted&mdash;stolen from him his brother, and
      steeled, in that brother, the only heart wherein he had a right to look
      for gratitude and love! No, it must be Madame de Merville. He dismissed
      Madame Dufour for pen and paper&mdash;rose&mdash;wrote a letter to Eugenie&mdash;grateful,
      but proud, and inclosed the notes. He then summoned Madame Dufour, and
      sent her with his despatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; said the ci-devant bonne, when she found herself in
      Eugenie&rsquo;s presence. &ldquo;The poor lad! how handsome he is, and how shameful in
      the Vicomte to let him wear such clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Vicomte!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear mistress, you must not deny it. You told me, in your note, to
      ask him no questions, but I guessed at once. The Vicomte told me himself
      that he should have the young gentleman over in a few days. You need not
      be ashamed of him. You will see what a difference clothes will make in his
      appearance; and I have taken it on myself to order a tailor to go to him.
      The Vicomte&mdash;must pay me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word to the Vicomte as yet. We will surprise him,&rdquo; said Eugenie,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Merville had been all that morning trying to invent some story
      to account for her interest in the lodger, and now how Fortune favoured
      her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is that a letter for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I had almost forgot it,&rdquo; said Madame Dufour, as she extended the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever there had hitherto been in the circumstances connected with
      Morton, that had roused the interest and excited the romance of Eugenie de
      Merville, her fancy was yet more attracted by the tone of the letter she
      now read. For though Morton, more accustomed to speak than to write
      French, expressed himself with less precision, and a less euphuistic
      selection of phrase, than the authors and elegans who formed her usual
      correspondents; there was an innate and rough nobleness&mdash;a strong and
      profound feeling in every line of his letter, which increased her surprise
      and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that surrounds him&mdash;all that belongs to him, is strangeness and
      mystery!&rdquo; murmured she; and she sat down to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Madame Dufour departed with that letter, Eugenie remained silent and
      thoughtful for more than an hour, Morton&rsquo;s letter before her; and sweet,
      in their indistinctness, were the recollections and the images that
      crowded on her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton, satisfied by the earnest and solemn assurances of Eugenie that she
      was not the unknown donor of the sum she reinclosed, after puzzling
      himself in vain to form any new conjectures as to the quarter whence it
      came, felt that under his present circumstances it would be an absurd
      Quixotism to refuse to apply what the very Providence to whom he had anew
      consigned himself seemed to have sent to his aid. And it placed him, too,
      beyond the offer of all pecuniary assistance from one from whom he could
      least have brooked to receive it. He consented, therefore, to all that the
      loquacious tailor proposed to him. And it would have been difficult to
      have recognised the wild and frenzied fugitive in the stately form, with
      its young beauty and air of well-born pride, which the next day sat by the
      side of Eugenie. And that day he told his sad and troubled story, and
      Eugenie wept: and from that day he came daily; and two weeks&mdash;happy,
      dreamlike, intoxicating to both&mdash;passed by; and as their last sun
      set, he was kneeling at her feet, and breathing to one to whom the homage
      of wit, and genius, and complacent wealth had hitherto been vainly
      proffered, the impetuous, agitated, delicious secrets of the First Love.
      He spoke, and rose to depart for ever&mdash;when the look and sigh
      detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, after a sleepless night, Eugenie de Merville sent for the
      Vicomte de Vaudemont.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;A silver river small
        In sweet accents
        Its music vents;
        The warbling virginal
        To which the merry birds do sing,
        Timed with stops of gold the silver string.&rdquo;
         Sir Richard Fanshawe.
</pre>
    <p>
      One evening, several weeks after the events just commemorated, a stranger,
      leading in his hand, a young child, entered the churchyard of H&mdash;&mdash;.
      The sun had not long set, and the short twilight of deepening summer
      reigned in the tranquil skies; you might still hear from the trees above
      the graves the chirp of some joyous bird;&mdash;what cared he, the denizen
      of the skies, for the dead that slept below?&mdash;what did he value save
      the greenness and repose of the spot,&mdash;to him alike the garden or the
      grave! As the man and the child passed, the robin, scarcely scared by
      their tread from the long grass beside one of the mounds, looked at them
      with its bright, blithe eye. It was a famous plot for the robin&mdash;the
      old churchyard! That domestic bird&mdash;&ldquo;the friend of man,&rdquo; as it has
      been called by the poets&mdash;found a jolly supper among the worms!
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, on reaching the middle of the sacred ground, paused and
      looked round him wistfully. He then approached, slowly and hesitatingly,
      an oblong tablet, on which were graven, in letters yet fresh and new,
      these words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 TO THE
         MEMORY OF ONE CALUMNIATED AND WRONGED
           THIS BURIAL-STONE IS DEDICATED
               BY HER SON.
</pre>
    <p>
      Such, with the addition of the dates of birth and death, was the tablet
      which Philip Morton had directed to be placed over his mother&rsquo;s bones; and
      around it was set a simple palisade, which defended it from the tread of
      the children, who sometimes, in defiance of the beadle, played over the
      dust of the former race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy son!&rdquo; muttered the stranger, while the child stood quietly by his
      side, pleased by the trees, the grass, the song of the birds, and reeking
      not of grief or death,&mdash;&ldquo;thy son!&mdash;but not thy favoured son&mdash;thy
      darling&mdash;thy youngest born; on what spot of earth do thine eyes look
      down on him? Surely in heaven thy love has preserved the one whom on earth
      thou didst most cherish, from the sufferings and the trials that have
      visited the less-favoured outcast. Oh, mother&mdash;mother!&mdash;it was
      not his crime&mdash;not Philip&rsquo;s&mdash;that he did not fulfil to the last
      the trust bequeathed to him! Happier, perhaps, as it is! And, oh, if thy
      memory be graven as deeply in my brother&rsquo;s heart as my own, how often will
      it warn and save him! That memory!&mdash;it has been to me the angel of my
      life! To thee&mdash;to thee, even in death, I owe it, if, though erring, I
      am not criminal,&mdash;if I have lived with the lepers, and am still
      undefiled!&rdquo; His lips then were silent&mdash;not his heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes thus consumed he turned to the child, and said, gently
      and in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;Fanny, you have been taught to pray&mdash;you
      will live near this spot,&mdash;will you come sometimes here and pray that
      you may grow up good and innocent, and become a blessing to those who love
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will papa ever come to hear me pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That sad and unconscious question went to the heart of Morton. The child
      could not comprehend death. He had sought to explain it, but she had been
      accustomed to consider her protector dead when he was absent from her, and
      she still insisted that he must come again to life. And that man of
      turbulence and crime, who had passed unrepentant, unabsolved, from sin to
      judgment: it was an awful question, &ldquo;If he should hear her pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said he, after a pause,&mdash;&ldquo;yes, Fanny, there is a Father who
      will hear you pray; and pray to Him to be merciful to those who have been
      kind to you. Fanny, you and I may never meet again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to die too? Mechant, every one dies to Fanny!&rdquo; and,
      clinging to him endearingly, she put up her lips to kiss him. He took her
      in his arms: and, as a tear fell upon her rosy cheek, she said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      cry, brother, for I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, dear Fanny? Then, for my sake, when you come to this place, if
      any one will give you a few flowers, scatter them on that stone. And now
      we will go to one whom you must love also, and to whom, as I have told
      you, he sends you; he who&mdash;Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he thus spoke, and placed Fanny again on the ground, he was startled to
      see: precisely on the spot where he had seen before the like apparition&mdash;on
      the same spot where the father had cursed the son, the motionless form of
      an old man. Morton recognised, as if by an instinct rather than by an
      effort of the memory, the person to whom he was bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly towards him; but Fanny abruptly left his side, lured by a
      moth that flitted duskily over the graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, sir, I think, is Simon Gawtrey?&rdquo; said Morton. &ldquo;I have came to
      England in quest of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of me?&rdquo; said the old man, half rising, and his eyes, now completely
      blind, rolled vacantly over Morton&rsquo;s person&mdash;&ldquo;Of me?&mdash;for what?&mdash;Who
      are you?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know your voice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come to you from your son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, with great vehemence,&mdash;&ldquo;the
      reprobate!&mdash;the dishonoured!&mdash;the infamous!&mdash;the accursed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! you revile the dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; muttered the wretched father, tottering back to the seat he had
      quitted,&mdash;&ldquo;dead!&rdquo; and the sound of his voice was so full of anguish,
      that the dog at his feet, which Morton had not hitherto perceived, echoed
      it with a dismal cry, that recalled to Philip the awful day in which he
      had seen the son quit the father for the last time on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound brought Fanny to the spot; and, with a laugh of delight, which
      made to it a strange contrast, she threw herself on the grass beside the
      dog and sought to entice it to play. So there, in that place of death,
      were knit together the four links in the Great Chain;&mdash;lusty and
      blooming life&mdash;desolate and doting age&mdash;infancy, yet scarce
      conscious of a soul&mdash;and the dumb brute, that has no warrant of a
      Hereafter!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&mdash;dead!&rdquo; repeated the old man, covering his sightless balls
      with his withered hands. &ldquo;Poor William!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He remembered you to the last. He bade me seek you out&mdash;he bade me
      replace the guilty son with a thing pure and innocent, as he had been had
      he died in his cradle&mdash;a child to comfort your old age! Kneel, Fanny,
      I have found you a father who will cherish you&mdash;(oh! you will, sir,
      will you not?)&mdash;as he whom you may see no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something in Morton&rsquo;s voice so solemn, that it awed and touched
      both the old man and the infant; and Fanny, creeping to the protector thus
      assigned to her, and putting her little hands confidingly on his knees,
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny will love you if papa wished it. Kiss Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it his child&mdash;his?&rdquo; said the blind man, sobbing. &ldquo;Come to my
      heart; here&mdash;here! O God, forgive me!&rdquo; Morton did not think it right
      at that moment to undeceive him with regard to the poor child&rsquo;s true
      connexion with the deceased: and he waited in silence till Simon, after a
      burst of passionate grief and tenderness, rose, and still clasping the
      child to his breast, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, forgive me!&mdash;I am a very weak old man&mdash;I have many thanks
      to give&mdash;I have much, too, to learn. My poor son! he did not die in
      want,&mdash;did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The particulars of Gawtrey&rsquo;s fate, with his real name and the various
      aliases he had assumed, had appeared in the French journals, had been
      partially copied into the English; and Morton had expected to have been
      saved the painful narrative of that fearful death; but the utter seclusion
      of the old man, his infirmity, and his estranged habits, had shut him out
      from the intelligence that it now devolved on Philip to communicate.
      Morton hesitated a little before he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is late now; you are not yet prepared to receive this poor infant at
      your home, nor to hear the details I have to state. I arrived in England
      but to-day. I shall lodge in the neighbourhood, for it is dear to me. If I
      may feel sure, then, that you will receive and treasure this sacred and
      last deposit bequeathed to you by your unhappy son, I will bring my charge
      to you to-morrow, and we will then, more calmly than we can now, talk over
      the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not answer my question,&rdquo; said Simon, passionately; &ldquo;answer that,
      and I will wait for the rest. They call me a miser! Did I send out my only
      child to starve? Answer that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be comforted. He did not die in want; and he has even left some little
      fortune for Fanny, which I was to place in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he thought to bribe the old miser to be human! Well&mdash;well&mdash;well&mdash;I
      will go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lean on me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog leapt playfully on his master as the latter rose, and Fanny slid
      from Simon&rsquo;s arms to caress and talk to the animal in her own way. As they
      slowly passed through the churchyard Simon muttered incoherently to
      himself for several paces, and Morton would not disturb, since he could
      not comfort, him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he said abruptly, &ldquo;Did my son repent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped,&rdquo; answered Morton, evasively, &ldquo;that, had his life been spared, he
      would have amended!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush, sir!&mdash;I am past seventy; we repent!&mdash;we never amend!&rdquo; And
      Simon again sunk into his own dim and disconnected reveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they arrived at the blind man&rsquo;s house. The door was opened to
      them by an old woman of disagreeable and sinister aspect, dressed out much
      too gaily for the station of a servant, though such was her reputed
      capacity; but the miser&rsquo;s affliction saved her from the chance of his
      comment on her extravagance. As she stood in the doorway with a candle in
      her hand, she scanned curiously, and with no welcoming eye, her master&rsquo;s
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Boxer, my son is dead!&rdquo; said Simon, in a hollow voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a good thing it is, then, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For shame, woman!&rdquo; said Morton, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey-dey! sir! whom have we got here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One,&rdquo; said Simon, sternly, &ldquo;whom you will treat with respect. He brings
      me a blessing to lighten my loss. One harsh word to this child, and you
      quit my house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked perfectly thunderstruck; but, recovering herself, she
      said, whiningly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! a harsh word to anything my dear, kind master cares for. And, Lord,
      what a sweet pretty creature it is! Come here, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fanny shrunk back, and would not let go Philip&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, then,&rdquo; said Morton; and he was turning away, when a sudden
      thought seemed to cross the old man,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, sir&mdash;stay! I&mdash;I&mdash;did my son say I was rich? I am
      very, very poor&mdash;nothing in the house, or I should have been robbed
      long ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son told me to bring money, not to ask for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask for it! No; but,&rdquo; added the old man, and a gleam of cunning
      intelligence shot over his face,&mdash;&ldquo;but he had got into a bad set.
      Ask!&mdash;No!&mdash;Put up the door-chain, Mrs. Boxer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with doubt and misgivings that Morton, the next day, consigned the
      child, who had already nestled herself into the warmest core of his heart,
      to the care of Simon. Nothing short of that superstitious respect, which
      all men owe to the wishes of the dead, would have made him select for her
      that asylum; for Fate had now, in brightening his own prospects, given him
      an alternative in the benevolence of Madame de Merville. But Gawtrey had
      been so earnest on the subject, that he felt as if he had no right to
      hesitate. And was it not a sort of atonement to any faults the son might
      have committed against the parent, to place by the old man&rsquo;s hearth so
      sweet a charge?
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange and peculiar mind and character of Fanny made him, however,
      yet more anxious than otherwise he might have been. She certainly deserved
      not the harsh name of imbecile or idiot, but she was different from all
      other children; she felt more acutely than most of her age, but she could
      not be taught to reason. There was something either oblique or deficient
      in her intellect, which justified the most melancholy apprehensions; yet
      often, when some disordered, incoherent, inexplicable train of ideas most
      saddened the listener, it would be followed by fancies so exquisite in
      their strangeness, or feelings so endearing in their tenderness, that
      suddenly she seemed as much above, as before she seemed below, the
      ordinary measure of infant comprehension. She was like a creature to which
      Nature, in some cruel but bright caprice, has given all that belongs to
      poetry, but denied all that belongs to the common understanding necessary
      to mankind; or, as a fairy changeling, not, indeed, according to the
      vulgar superstition, malignant and deformed, but lovelier than the
      children of men, and haunted by dim and struggling associations of a
      gentler and fairer being, yet wholly incapable to learn the dry and hard
      elements which make up the knowledge of actual life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton, as well as he could, sought to explain to Simon the peculiarities
      in Fanny&rsquo;s mental constitution. He urged on him the necessity of providing
      for her careful instruction, and Simon promised to send her to the best
      school the neighbourhood could afford; but, as the old man spoke, he dwelt
      so much on the supposed fact that Fanny was William&rsquo;s daughter, and with
      his remorse, or affection, there ran so interwoven a thread of selfishness
      and avarice, that Morton thought it would be dangerous to his interest in
      the child to undeceive his error. He, therefore,&mdash;perhaps excusably
      enough&mdash;remained silent on that subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gawtrey had placed with the superior of the convent, together with an
      order to give up the child to any one who should demand her in his true
      name, which he confided to the superior, a sum of nearly L300., which he
      solemnly swore had been honestly obtained, and which, in all his shifts
      and adversities, he had never allowed himself to touch. This sum, with the
      trifling deduction made for arrears due to the convent, Morton now placed
      in Simon&rsquo;s hands. The old man clutched the money, which was for the most
      in French gold, with a convulsive gripe: and then, as if ashamed of the
      impulse, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, sir&mdash;will any sum&mdash;that is, any reasonable sum&mdash;be
      of use to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! and if it were, it is neither yours nor mine&mdash;it is hers. Save
      it for her, and add to it what you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation took place, Fanny had been consigned to the care
      of Mrs. Boxer, and Philip now rose to see and bid her farewell before he
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may come again to visit you, Mr. Gawtrey; and I pray Heaven to find
      that you and Fanny have been a mutual blessing to each other. Oh, remember
      how your son loved her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a good heart, in spite of all his sins. Poor William!&rdquo; said Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip Morton heard, and his lip curled with a sad and a just disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If when, at the age of nineteen, William Gawtrey had quitted his father&rsquo;s
      roof, the father had then remembered that the son&rsquo;s heart was good,&mdash;the
      son had been alive still, an honest and a happy man. Do ye not laugh, O ye
      all-listening Fiends! when men praise those dead whose virtues they
      discovered not when alive? It takes much marble to build the sepulchre&mdash;how
      little of lath and plaster would have repaired the garret!
    </p>
    <p>
      On turning into a small room adjoining the parlour in which Gawtrey sat,
      Morton found Fanny standing gloomily by a dull, soot-grimed window, which
      looked out on the dead walls of a small yard. Mrs. Boxer, seated by a
      table, was employed in trimming a cap, and putting questions to Fanny in
      that falsetto voice of endearment in which people not used to children are
      apt to address them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, my dear, they&rsquo;ve never taught you to read or write? You&rsquo;ve been
      sadly neglected, poor thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must do our best to supply the deficiency,&rdquo; said Morton, as he
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, sir, is that you?&rdquo; and the gouvernante bustled up and dropped a
      low courtesy; for Morton, dressed then in the garb of a gentleman, was of
      a mien and person calculated to strike the gaze of the vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, brother!&rdquo; cried Fanny, for by that name he had taught her to call
      him; and she flew to his side. &ldquo;Come away&mdash;it&rsquo;s ugly there&mdash;it
      makes me cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child, I told you you must stay; but I shall hope to see you again
      some day. Will you not be kind to this poor creature, ma&rsquo;am? Forgive me,
      if I offended you last night, and favour me by accepting this, to show
      that we are friends.&rdquo; As he spoke, he slid his purse into the woman&rsquo;s
      hand. &ldquo;I shall feel ever grateful for whatever you can do for Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny wants nothing from any one else; Fanny wants her brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet child! I fear she don&rsquo;t take to me. Will you like me, Miss Fanny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! get along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, Fanny&mdash;you remember you did not take to me at first. But she is
      so affectionate, ma&rsquo;am; she never forgets a kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do all I can to please her, sir. And so she is really master&rsquo;s
      grandchild?&rdquo; The woman fixed her eyes, as she spoke, so intently on
      Morton, that he felt embarrassed, and busied himself, without answering,
      in caressing and soothing Fanny, who now seemed to awake to the affliction
      about to visit her; for though she did not weep&mdash;she very rarely wept&mdash;her
      slight frame trembled&mdash;her eyes closed&mdash;her cheeks, even her
      lips, were white&mdash;and her delicate hands were clasped tightly round
      the neck of the one about to abandon her to strange breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morton was greatly moved. &ldquo;One kiss, Fanny! and do not forget me when we
      meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child pressed her lips to his cheek, but the lips were cold. He put
      her down gently; she stood mute and passive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember that he wished me to leave you here,&rdquo; whispered Morton, using an
      argument that never failed. &ldquo;We must obey him; and so&mdash;God bless you,
      Fanny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and retreated to the door; the child unclosed her eyes, and gazed
      at him with a strained, painful, imploring gaze; her lips moved, but she
      did not speak. Morton could not bear that silent woe. He sought to smile
      on her consolingly; but the smile would not come. He closed the door, and
      hurried from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day Fanny settled into a kind of dreary, inanimate stupor, which
      resembled that of the somnambulist whom the magnetiser forgets to waken.
      Hitherto, with all the eccentricities or deficiencies of her mind, had
      mingled a wild and airy gaiety. That was vanished. She spoke little&mdash;she
      never played&mdash;no toys could lure her&mdash;even the poor dog failed
      to win her notice. If she was told to do anything she stared vacantly and
      stirred not. She evinced, however, a kind of dumb regard to the old blind
      man; she would creep to his knees and sit there for hours, seldom
      answering when he addressed her, but uneasy, anxious, and restless, if he
      left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you die too?&rdquo; she asked once; the old man understood her not, and
      she did not try to explain. Early one morning, some days after Morton was
      gone, they missed her: she was not in the house, nor the dull yard where
      she was sometimes dismissed and told to play&mdash;told in vain. In great
      alarm the old man accused Mrs. Boxer of having spirited her away, and
      threatened and stormed so loudly that the woman, against her will, went
      forth to the search. At last she found the child in the churchyard,
      standing wistfully beside a tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you here, you little plague?&rdquo; said Mrs. Boxer, rudely seizing her
      by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the way they will both come back some day! I dreamt so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever I catch you here again!&rdquo; said the housekeeper, and, wiping her
      brow with one hand, she struck the child with the other. Fanny had never
      been struck before. She recoiled in terror and amazement, and, for the
      first time since her arrival, burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;come, no crying! and if you tell master I&rsquo;ll beat you within
      an inch of your life!&rdquo; So saying, she caught Fanny in her arms, and,
      walking about, scolding and menacing, till she had frightened back the
      child&rsquo;s tears, she returned triumphantly to the house, and bursting into
      the parlour, exclaimed, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the little darling, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When old Simon learned where the child had been found he was glad; for it
      was his constant habit, whenever the evening was fine, to glide out to
      that churchyard&mdash;his dog his guide&mdash;and sit on his one favourite
      spot opposite the setting sun. This, not so much for the sanctity of the
      place, or the meditations it might inspire, as because it was the nearest,
      the safest, and the loneliest spot in the neighbourhood of his home, where
      the blind man could inhale the air and bask in the light of heaven.
      Hitherto, thinking it sad for the child, he had never taken her with him;
      indeed, at the hour of his monotonous excursion she had generally been
      banished to bed. Now she was permitted to accompany him; and the old man
      and the infant would sit there side by side, as Age and Infancy rested
      side by side in the graves below. The first symptom of childlike interest
      and curiosity that Fanny betrayed was awakened by the affliction of her
      protector. One evening, as they thus sat, she made him explain what the
      desolation of blindness is. She seemed to comprehend him, though he did
      not seek to adapt his complaints to her understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny knows,&rdquo; said she, touchingly; &ldquo;for she, too, is blind here;&rdquo; and
      she pressed her hands to her temples. Notwithstanding her silence and
      strange ways, and although he could not see the exquisite loveliness which
      Nature, as in remorseful pity, had lavished on her outward form, Simon
      soon learned to love her better than he had ever loved yet: for they most
      cold to the child are often dotards to the grandchild. For her even his
      avarice slept. Dainties, never before known at his sparing board, were
      ordered to tempt her appetite, toy-shops ransacked to amuse her indolence.
      He was long, however, before he could prevail on himself to fulfil his
      promise to Morton, and rob himself of her presence. At length, however,
      wearied with Mrs. Boxer&rsquo;s lamentations at her ignorance, and alarmed
      himself at some evidences of helplessness, which made him dread to think
      what her future might be when left alone in life, he placed her at a
      day-school in the suburb. Here Fanny, for a considerable time, justified
      the harshest assertions of her stupidity. She could not even keep her eyes
      two minutes together on the page from which she was to learn the mysteries
      of reading; months passed before she mastered the alphabet, and, a month
      after, she had again forgot it, and the labour was renewed. The only thing
      in which she showed ability, if so it might be called, was in the use of
      the needle. The sisters of the convent had already taught her many pretty
      devices in this art; and when she found that at the school they were
      admired&mdash;that she was praised instead of blamed&mdash;her vanity was
      pleased, and she learned so readily all that they could teach in this not
      unprofitable accomplishment, that Mrs. Boxer slyly and secretly turned her
      tasks to account and made a weekly perquisite of the poor pupil&rsquo;s
      industry. Another faculty she possessed, in common with persons usually
      deficient, and with the lower species&mdash;viz., a most accurate and
      faithful recollection of places. At first Mrs. Boxer had been duly sent,
      morning, noon, and evening, to take her to, or bring her from, the school;
      but this was so great a grievance to Simon&rsquo;s solitary superintendent, and
      Fanny coaxed the old man so endearingly to allow her to go and return
      alone, that the attendance, unwelcome to both, was waived. Fanny exulted
      in this liberty; and she never, in going or in returning, missed passing
      through the burial-ground, and gazing wistfully at the tomb from which she
      yet believed Morton would one day reappear. With his memory she cherished
      also that of her earlier and more guilty protector; but they were separate
      feelings, which she distinguished in her own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa had given her up. She knew that he would not have sent her away, far&mdash;far
      over the great water, if he had meant to see Fanny again; but her brother
      was forced to leave her&mdash;he would come to life one day, and then they
      should live together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day, towards the end of autumn, as her schoolmistress, a good woman on
      the whole, but who had not yet had the wit to discover by what chords to
      tune the instrument, over which so wearily she drew her unskilful hand&mdash;one
      day, we say, the schoolmistress happened to be dressed for a christening
      party to which she was invited in the suburb; and, accordingly, after the
      morning lessons, the pupils were to be dismissed to a holiday. As Fanny
      now came last, with the hopeless spelling-book, she stopped suddenly
      short, and her eyes rested with avidity upon a large bouquet of exotic
      flowers, with which the good lady had enlivened the centre of the parted
      kerchief, whose yellow gauze modestly veiled that tender section of female
      beauty which poets have likened to hills of snow&mdash;a chilling simile!
      It was then autumn; and field, and even garden flowers were growing rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me one of those flowers?&rdquo; said Fanny, dropping her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of these flowers, child! why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny did not answer; but one of the elder and cleverer girls said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she comes from France, you know, ma&rsquo;am, and the Roman Catholics put
      flowers, and ribands, and things, over the graves; you recollect, ma&rsquo;am,
      we were reading yesterday about Pere-la-Chaise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Fanny will do any kind of work for us if we will give her
      flowers.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother told me where to put them;&mdash;but these pretty flowers, I
      never had any like them; they may bring him back again! I&rsquo;ll be so good if
      you&rsquo;ll give me one, only one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you learn your lesson if I do, Fanny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes! Wait a moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Fanny stole back to her desk, put the hateful book resolutely before
      her, pressed both hands tightly on her temples,&mdash;Eureka! the chord
      was touched; and Fanny marched in triumph through half a column of hostile
      double syllables!
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day the schoolmistress knew how to stimulate her, and Fanny
      learned to read: her path to knowledge thus literally strewn with flowers!
      Catherine, thy children were far off, and thy grave looked gay!
    </p>
    <p>
      It naturally happened that those short and simple rhymes, often sacred,
      which are repeated in schools as helps to memory, made a part of her
      studies; and no sooner had the sound of verse struck upon her fancy than
      it seemed to confuse and agitate anew all her senses. It was like the
      music of some breeze, to which dance and tremble all the young leaves of a
      wild plant. Even when at the convent she had been fond of repeating the
      infant rhymes with which they had sought to lull or to amuse her, but now
      the taste was more strongly developed. She confounded, however, in
      meaningless and motley disorder, the various snatches of song that came to
      her ear, weaving them together in some form which she understood, but
      which was jargon to all others; and often, as she went alone through the
      green lanes or the bustling streets, the passenger would turn in pity and
      fear to hear her half chant&mdash;half murmur&mdash;ditties that seemed to
      suit only a wandering and unsettled imagination. And as Mrs. Boxer, in her
      visits to the various shops in the suburb, took care to bemoan her hard
      fate in attending to a creature so evidently moon-stricken, it was no
      wonder that the manner and habits of the child, coupled with that strange
      predilection to haunt the burial-ground, which is not uncommon with
      persons of weak and disordered intellect; confirmed the character thus
      given to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as she tripped gaily and lightly along the thoroughfares, the children
      would draw aside from her path, and whisper with superstitious fear
      mingled with contempt, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the idiot girl!&rdquo;&mdash;Idiot&mdash;how much
      more of heaven&rsquo;s light was there in that cloud than in the rushlights
      that, flickering in sordid chambers, shed on dull things the dull ray&mdash;esteeming
      themselves as stars!
    </p>
    <p>
      Months&mdash;years passed&mdash;Fanny was thirteen, when there dawned a
      new era to her existence. Mrs. Boxer had never got over her first grudge
      to Fanny. Her treatment of the poor girl was always harsh, and sometimes
      cruel. But Fanny did not complain, and as Mrs. Boxer&rsquo;s manner to her
      before Simon was invariably cringing and caressing, the old man never
      guessed the hardships his supposed grandchild underwent. There had been
      scandal some years back in the suburb about the relative connexion of the
      master and the housekeeper; and the flaunting dress of the latter,
      something bold in her regard, and certain whispers that her youth had not
      been vowed to Vesta, confirmed the suspicion. The only reason why we do
      not feel sure that the rumour was false is this,&mdash;Simon Gawtrey had
      been so hard on the early follies of his son! Certainly, at all events,
      the woman had exercised great influence over the miser before the arrival
      of Fanny, and she had done much to steel his selfishness against the
      ill-fated William. And, as certainly, she had fully calculated on
      succeeding to the savings, whatever they might be, of the miser, whenever
      Providence should be pleased to terminate his days. She knew that Simon
      had, many years back, made his will in her favour; she knew that he had
      not altered that will: she believed, therefore, that in spite of all his
      love for Fanny, he loved his gold so much more, that he could not accustom
      himself to the thought of bequeathing it to hands too helpless to guard
      the treasure. This had in some measure reconciled the housekeeper to the
      intruder; whom, nevertheless, she hated as a dog hates another dog, not
      only for taking his bone, but for looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly Simon fell ill. His age made it probable he would die. He
      took to his bed&mdash;his breathing grew fainter and fainter&mdash;he
      seemed dead. Fanny, all unconscious, sat by his bedside as usual, holding
      her breath not to waken him. Mrs. Boxer flew to the bureau&mdash;she
      unlocked it&mdash;she could not find the will; but she found three bags of
      bright gold guineas: the sight charmed her. She tumbled them forth on the
      distained green cloth of the bureau&mdash;she began to count them; and at
      that moment, the old man, as if there were a secret magnetism between
      himself and the guineas, woke from his trance. His blindness saved him the
      pain that might have been fatal, of seeing the unhallowed profanation; but
      he heard the chink of the metal. The very sound restored his strength. But
      the infirm are always cunning&mdash;he breathed not a suspicion. &ldquo;Mrs.
      Boxer,&rdquo; said he, faintly, &ldquo;I think I could take some broth.&rdquo; Mrs. Boxer
      rose in great dismay, gently re-closed the bureau, and ran down-stairs for
      the broth. Simon took the occasion to question Fanny; and no sooner had he
      learnt the operation of the heir-expectant, than he bade the girl first
      lock the bureau and bring him the key, and next run to a lawyer (whose
      address he gave her), and fetch him instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a malignant smile the old man took the broth from his handmaid,&mdash;&ldquo;Poor
      Boxer, you are a disinterested creature,&rdquo; said he, feebly; &ldquo;I think you
      will grieve when I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boxer sobbed, and before she had recovered, the lawyer entered. That
      day a new will was made; and the lawyer politely informed Mrs. Boxer that
      her services would be dispensed with the next morning, when he should
      bring a nurse to the house. Mrs. Boxer heard, and took her resolution. As
      soon as Simon again fell asleep, she crept into the room&mdash;led away
      Fanny&mdash;locked her up in her own chamber&mdash;returned&mdash;searched
      for the key of the bureau, which she found at last under Simon&rsquo;s pillow&mdash;possessed
      herself of all she could lay her hands on&mdash;and the next morning she
      had disappeared forever! Simon&rsquo;s loss was greater than might have been
      supposed; for, except a trifling sum in the savings bank, he, like many
      other misers, kept all he had, in notes or specie, under his own lock and
      key. His whole fortune, indeed, was far less than was supposed: for money
      does not make money unless it is put out to interest,&mdash;and the miser
      cheated himself. Such portion as was in bank-notes Mrs. Boxer probably had
      the prudence to destroy; for those numbers which Simon could remember were
      never traced; the gold, who could swear to? Except the pittance in the
      savings bank, and whatever might be the paltry worth of the house he
      rented, the father who had enriched the menial to exile the son was a
      beggar in his dotage. This news, however, was carefully concealed from him
      by the advice of the doctor, whom, on his own responsibility, the lawyer
      introduced, till he had recovered sufficiently to bear the shock without
      danger; and the delay naturally favoured Mrs. Boxer&rsquo;s escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon remained for some moments perfectly stunned and speechless when the
      news was broken to him. Fanny, in alarm at his increasing paleness, sprang
      to his breast. He pushed her away,&mdash;&ldquo;Go&mdash;go&mdash;go, child,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t feed you now. Leave me to starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To starve!&rdquo; said Fanny, wonderingly; and she stole away, and sat herself
      down as if in deep thought. She then crept up to the lawyer as he was
      about to leave the room, after exhausting his stock of commonplace
      consolation; and putting her hand in his, whispered, &ldquo;I want to talk to
      you&mdash;this way:&rdquo;&mdash;She led him through the passage into the open
      air. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when poor people try not to starve, don&rsquo;t they
      work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For rich people buy poor people&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my dear; to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Mrs. Boxer used to sell my work. Fanny will feed grandpapa! Go
      and tell him never to say &lsquo;starve&rsquo; again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good-natured lawyer was moved. &ldquo;Can you work, indeed, my poor girl?
      Well, put on your bonnet, and come and talk to my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was the new era in Fanny&rsquo;s existence! Her schooling was stopped.
      But now life schooled her. Necessity ripened her intellect. And many a
      hard eye moistened,&mdash;as, seeing her glide with her little basket of
      fancy work along the streets, still murmuring her happy and bird-like
      snatches of unconnected song&mdash;men and children alike said with
      respect, in which there was now no contempt, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the idiot girl who
      supports her blind grandfather!&rdquo; They called her idiot still!

    <p>
      If, reader, you have ever looked through a solar microscope at the
      monsters in a drop of water, perhaps you have wondered to yourself how
      things so terrible have been hitherto unknown to you&mdash;you have felt a
      loathing at the limpid element you hitherto deemed so pure&mdash;you have
      half fancied that you would cease to be a water-drinker; yet, the next day
      you have forgotten the grim life that started before you, with its
      countless shapes, in that teeming globule; and, if so tempted by your
      thirst, you have not shrunk from the lying crystal, although myriads of
      the horrible Unseen are mangling, devouring, gorging each other in the
      liquid you so tranquilly imbibe; so is it with that ancestral and master
      element called Life. Lapped in your sleek comforts, and lolling on the
      sofa of your patent conscience&mdash;when, perhaps for the first time, you
      look through the glass of science upon one ghastly globule in the waters
      that heave around, that fill up, with their succulence, the pores of
      earth, that moisten every atom subject to your eyes or handled by your
      touch&mdash;you are startled and dismayed; you say, mentally, &ldquo;Can such
      things be? I never dreamed of this before! I thought what was invisible to
      me was non-existent in itself&mdash;I will remember this dread
      experiment.&rdquo; The next day the experiment is forgotten.&mdash;The Chemist

      the common eye. Who would judge well of God&rsquo;s great designs, if he could

      without the help of his solar microscope?

    <p>
      It is ten years after the night on which William Gawtrey perished:&mdash;I
      transport you, reader, to the fairest scenes in England,&mdash;scenes
      consecrated by the only true pastoral poetry we have known to
      Contemplation and Repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Autumn had begun to tinge the foliage on the banks of Winandermere. It had
      been a summer of unusual warmth and beauty; and if that year you had
      visited the English lakes, you might, from time to time, amidst the groups
      of happy idlers you encountered, have singled out two persons for
      interest, or, perhaps, for envy. Two who might have seemed to you in
      peculiar harmony with those serene and soft retreats, both young&mdash;both
      beautiful. Lovers you would have guessed them to be; but such lovers as
      Fletcher might have placed under the care of his &ldquo;Holy Shepherdess&rdquo;&mdash;forms
      that might have reclined by
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The virtuous well, about whose flowery banks
     The nimble-footed fairies dance their rounds
     By the pale moonshine.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For in the love of those persons there seemed a purity and innocence that
      suited well their youth and the character of their beauty. Perhaps,
      indeed, on the girl&rsquo;s side, love sprung rather from those affections which
      the spring of life throws upward to the surface, as the spring of earth
      does its flowers, than from that concentrated and deep absorption of self
      in self, which alone promises endurance and devotion, and of which first
      love, or rather the first fancy, is often less susceptible than that which
      grows out of the more thoughtful fondness of maturer years. Yet he, the
      lover, was of so rare and singular a beauty, that he might well seem
      calculated to awake, to the utmost, the love which wins the heart through
      the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to begin at the beginning. A lady of fashion had, in the autumn
      previous to the year in which our narrative re-opens, taken, with her
      daughter, a girl then of about eighteen, the tour of the English lakes.
      Charmed by the beauty of Winandermere, and finding one of the most
      commodious villas on its banks to be let, they had remained there all the
      winter. In the early spring a severe illness had seized the elder lady,
      and finding herself, as she slowly recovered, unfit for the gaieties of a
      London season, nor unwilling, perhaps,&mdash;for she had been a beauty in
      her day&mdash;to postpone for another year the debut of her daughter, she
      had continued her sojourn, with short intervals of absence, for a whole
      year. Her husband, a busy man of the world, with occupation in London, and
      fine estates in the country, joined them only occasionally, glad to escape
      the still beauty of landscapes which brought him no rental, and therefore
      afforded no charm to his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first month of their arrival at Winandermere, the mother and
      daughter had made an eventful acquaintance in the following manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as they were walking on their lawn, which sloped to the lake,
      they heard the sound of a flute, played with a skill so exquisite as to
      draw them, surprised and spellbound, to the banks. The musician was a
      young man, in a boat, which he had moored beneath the trees of their
      demesne. He was alone, or, rather, he had one companion, in a large
      Newfoundland dog, that sat watchful at the helm of the boat, and appeared
      to enjoy the music as much as his master. As the ladies approached the
      spot, the dog growled, and the young man ceased, though without seeing the
      fair causes of his companion&rsquo;s displeasure. The sun, then setting, shone
      full on his countenance as he looked round; and that countenance was one
      that might have haunted the nymphs of Delos; the face of Apollo, not as
      the hero, but the shepherd&mdash;not of the bow, but of the lute&mdash;not
      the Python-slayer, but the young dreamer by shady places&mdash;he whom the
      sculptor has portrayed leaning idly against the tree&mdash;the boy-god
      whose home is yet on earth, and to whom the Oracle and the Spheres are
      still unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the dog leaped from the boat, and the elder lady uttered a
      faint cry of alarm, which, directing the attention of the musician,
      brought him also ashore. He called off his dog, and apologised, with a not
      ungraceful mixture of diffidence and ease, for his intrusion. He was not
      aware the place was inhabited&mdash;it was a favourite haunt of his&mdash;he
      lived near. The elder lady was pleased with his address, and struck with
      his appearance. There was, indeed, in his manner that indefinable charm,
      which is more attractive than mere personal appearance, and which can
      never be imitated or acquired. They parted, however, without establishing
      any formal acquaintance. A few days after, they met at dinner at a
      neighbouring house, and were introduced by name. That of the young man
      seemed strange to the ladies; not so theirs to him. He turned pale when he
      heard it, and remained silent and aloof the rest of the evening. They met
      again and often; and for some weeks&mdash;nay, even for months&mdash;he
      appeared to avoid, as much as possible, the acquaintance so auspiciously
      begun; but, by little and little, the beauty of the younger lady seemed to
      gain ground on his diffidence or repugnance. Excursions among the
      neighbouring mountains threw them together, and at last he fairly
      surrendered himself to the charm he had at first determined to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young man lived on the opposite side of the lake, in a quiet
      household, of which he was the idol. His life had been one of almost
      monastic purity and repose; his tastes were accomplished, his character
      seemed soft and gentle; but beneath that calm exterior, flashes of passion&mdash;the
      nature of the poet, ardent and sensitive&mdash;would break forth at times.
      He had scarcely ever, since his earliest childhood, quitted those
      retreats; he knew nothing of the world, except in books&mdash;books of
      poetry and romance. Those with whom he lived&mdash;his relations, an old
      bachelor, and the cold bachelor&rsquo;s sisters, old maids&mdash;seemed equally
      innocent and inexperienced. It was a family whom the rich respected and
      the poor loved&mdash;inoffensive, charitable, and well off. To whatever
      their easy fortune might be, he appeared the heir. The name of this young
      man was Charles Spencer; the ladies were Mrs. Beaufort, and Camilla her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaufort, though a shrewd woman, did not at first perceive any danger
      in the growing intimacy between Camilla and the younger Spencer. Her
      daughter was not her favourite&mdash;not the object of her one thought or
      ambition. Her whole heart and soul were wrapped in her son Arthur, who
      lived principally abroad. Clever enough to be considered capable, when he
      pleased, of achieving distinction, good-looking enough to be thought
      handsome by all who were on the qui vive for an advantageous match,
      good-natured enough to be popular with the society in which he lived,
      scattering to and fro money without limit,&mdash;Arthur Beaufort, at the
      age of thirty, had established one of those brilliant and evanescent
      reputations, which, for a few years, reward the ambition of the fine
      gentleman. It was precisely the reputation that the mother could
      appreciate, and which even the more saving father secretly admired, while,
      ever respectable in phrase, Mr. Robert Beaufort seemed openly to regret
      it. This son was, I say, everything to them; they cared little, in
      comparison, for their daughter. How could a daughter keep up the proud
      name of Beaufort? However well she might marry, it was another house, not
      theirs, which her graces and beauty would adorn. Moreover, the better she
      might marry the greater her dowry would naturally be,&mdash;the dowry, to
      go out of the family! And Arthur, poor fellow! was so extravagant, that
      really he would want every sixpence. Such was the reasoning of the father.
      The mother reasoned less upon the matter. Mrs. Beaufort, faded and meagre,
      in blonde and cashmere, was jealous of the charms of her daughter; and she
      herself, growing sentimental and lachrymose as she advanced in life, as
      silly women often do, had convinced herself that Camilla was a girl of no
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Beaufort was, indeed, of a character singularly calm and placid; it
      was the character that charms men in proportion, perhaps, to their own
      strength and passion. She had been rigidly brought up&mdash;her affections
      had been very early chilled and subdued; they moved, therefore, now, with
      ease, in the serene path of her duties. She held her parents, especially
      her father, in reverential fear, and never dreamed of the possibility of
      resisting one of their wishes, much less their commands. Pious, kind,
      gentle, of a fine and never-ruffled temper, Camilla, an admirable
      daughter, was likely to make no less admirable a wife; you might depend on
      her principles, if ever you could doubt her affection. Few girls were more
      calculated to inspire love. You would scarcely wonder at any folly, any
      madness, which even a wise man might commit for her sake. This did not
      depend on her beauty alone, though she was extremely lovely rather than
      handsome, and of that style of loveliness which is universally
      fascinating: the figure, especially as to the arms, throat, and bust, was
      exquisite; the mouth dimpled; the teeth dazzling; the eyes of that velvet
      softness which to look on is to love. But her charm was in a certain
      prettiness of manner, an exceeding innocence, mixed with the most
      captivating, because unconscious, coquetry. With all this, there was a
      freshness, a joy, a virgin and bewitching candour in her voice, her laugh&mdash;you
      might almost say in her very movements. Such was Camilla Beaufort at that
      age. Such she seemed to others. To her parents she was only a great girl
      rather in the way. To Mrs. Beaufort a rival, to Mr. Beaufort an
      encumbrance on the property.

    <p>
      One day (nearly a year after their first introduction) as with a party of
      friends Camilla and Charles Spencer were riding through those wild and
      romantic scenes which lie between the sunny Winandermere and the dark and
      sullen Wastwater, their conversation fell on topics more personal than it
      had hitherto done, for as yet, if they felt love, they had never spoken of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrowness of the path allowed only two to ride abreast, and the two
      to whom I confine my description were the last of the little band.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I wish Arthur were here!&rdquo; said Camilla; &ldquo;I am sure you would like
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? He lives much in the world&mdash;the world of which I know
      nothing. Are we then characters to suit each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the kindest&mdash;the best of human beings!&rdquo; said Camilla, rather
      evasively, but with more warmth than usually dwelt in her soft and low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he so kind?&rdquo; returned Spencer, musingly. &ldquo;Well, it may be so. And who
      would not be kind to you? Ah! it is a beautiful connexion that of brother
      and sister&mdash;I never had a sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you then a brother?&rdquo; asked Camilla, in some surprise, and turning
      her ingenuous eyes full on her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spencer&rsquo;s colour rose&mdash;rose to his temples: his voice trembled as he
      answered, &ldquo;No;&mdash;no brother!&rdquo; then, speaking in a rapid and hurried
      tone, he continued, &ldquo;My life has been a strange and lonely one. I am an
      orphan. I have mixed with few of my own age: my boyhood and youth have
      been spent in these scenes; my education such as Nature and books could
      bestow, with scarcely any guide or tutor save my guardian&mdash;the dear
      old man! Thus the world, the stir of cities, ambition, enterprise,&mdash;all
      seem to me as things belonging to a distant land to which I shall never
      wander. Yet I have had my dreams, Miss Beaufort; dreams of which these
      solitudes still form a part&mdash;but solitudes not unshared. And lately I
      have thought that those dreams might be prophetic. And you&mdash;do you
      love the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, like you, have scarcely tried it,&rdquo; said Camilla, with a sweet laugh.
      &ldquo;but I love the country better,&mdash;oh! far better than what little I
      have seen of towns. But for you,&rdquo; she continued with a charming
      hesitation, &ldquo;a man is so different from us,&mdash;for you to shrink from
      the world&mdash;you, so young and with talents too&mdash;nay, it is true!&mdash;it
      seems to me strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so, but I cannot tell you what feelings of dread&mdash;what
      vague forebodings of terror seize me if I carry my thoughts beyond these
      retreats. Perhaps my good guardian&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle?&rdquo; interrupted Camilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, my uncle&mdash;may have contributed to engender feelings, as you say,
      strange at my age; but still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My earlier childhood,&rdquo; continued Spencer, breathing hard and turning
      pale, &ldquo;was not spent in the happy home I have now; it was passed in a
      premature ordeal of suffering and pain. Its recollections have left a dark
      shadow on my mind, and under that shadow lies every thought that points
      towards the troublous and labouring career of other men. But,&rdquo; he resumed
      after a pause, and in a deep, earnest, almost solemn voice,&mdash;&ldquo;but
      after all, is this cowardice or wisdom? I find no monotony&mdash;no tedium
      in this quiet life. Is there not a certain morality&mdash;a certain
      religion in the spirit of a secluded and country existence? In it we do
      not know the evil passions which ambition and strife are said to arouse. I
      never feel jealous or envious of other men; I never know what it is to
      hate; my boat, my horse, our garden, music, books, and, if I may dare to
      say so, the solemn gladness that comes from the hopes of another life,&mdash;these
      fill up every hour with thoughts and pursuits, peaceful, happy, and
      without a cloud, till of late, when&mdash;when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When what?&rdquo; said Camilla, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I have longed, but did not dare to ask another, if to share such a
      lot would content her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent, as he spoke, his soft blue eyes full upon the blushing face of
      her whom he addressed, and Camilla half smiled and half sighed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our companions are far before us,&rdquo; said she, turning away her face, &ldquo;and
      see, the road is now smooth.&rdquo; She quickened her horse&rsquo;s pace as she said
      this; and Spencer, too new to women to interpret favourably her evasion of
      his words and looks, fell into a profound silence which lasted during the
      rest of their excursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As towards the decline of day he bent his solitary way home, emotions and
      passions to which his life had hitherto been a stranger, and which, alas!
      he had vainly imagined a life so tranquil would everlastingly restrain,
      swelled his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not love me,&rdquo; he muttered, half aloud; &ldquo;she will leave me, and
      what then will all the beauty of the landscape seem in my eyes? And how
      dare I look up to her? Even if her cold, vain mother&mdash;her father, the
      man, they say, of forms and scruples, were to consent, would they not
      question closely of my true birth and origin? And if the one blot were
      overlooked, is there no other? His early habits and vices, his?&mdash;a
      brother&rsquo;s&mdash;his unknown career terminating at any day, perhaps, in
      shame, in crime, in exposure, in the gibbet,&mdash;will they overlook
      this?&rdquo; As he spoke, he groaned aloud, and, as if impatient to escape
      himself, spurred on his horse and rested not till he reached the belt of
      trim and sober evergreens that surrounded his hitherto happy home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his horse to find its way to the stables, the young man passed
      through rooms, which he found deserted, to the lawn on the other side,
      which sloped to the smooth waters of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, seated under the one large tree that formed the pride of the lawn,
      over which it cast its shadow broad and far, he perceived his guardian
      poring idly over an oft-read book, one of those books of which literary
      dreamers are apt to grow fanatically fond&mdash;books by the old English
      writers, full of phrases and conceits half quaint and half sublime,
      interspersed with praises of the country, imbued with a poetical rather
      than orthodox religion, and adorned with a strange mixture of monastic
      learning and aphorisms collected from the weary experience of actual life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left, by a greenhouse, built between the house and the lake, might
      be seen the white dress and lean form of the eldest spinster sister, to
      whom the care of the flowers&mdash;for she had been early crossed in love&mdash;was
      consigned; at a little distance from her, the other two were seated at
      work, and conversing in whispers, not to disturb their studious brother,
      no doubt upon the nephew, who was their all in all. It was the calmest
      hour of eve, and the quiet of the several forms, their simple and harmless
      occupations&mdash;if occupations they might be called&mdash;the breathless
      foliage rich in the depth of summer; behind, the old-fashioned house,
      unpretending, not mean, its open doors and windows giving glimpses of the
      comfortable repose within; before, the lake, without a ripple and catching
      the gleam of the sunset clouds,&mdash;all made a picture of that complete
      tranquillity and stillness, which sometimes soothes and sometimes saddens
      us, according as we are in the temper to woo CONTENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man glided to his guardian and touched his shoulder,&mdash;&ldquo;Sir,
      may I speak to you?&mdash;Hush! they need not see us now! it is only you I
      would speak with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder Spencer rose; and, with his book still in his hand, moved side
      by side with his nephew under the shadow of the tree and towards a walk to
      the right, which led for a short distance along the margin of the lake,
      backed by the interlaced boughs of a thick copse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the young man, speaking first, and with a visible effort,
      &ldquo;your cautions have been in vain! I love this girl&mdash;this daughter of
      the haughty Beauforts! I love her&mdash;better than life I love her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy,&rdquo; said the uncle tenderly, and with a simple fondness passing
      his arm over the speaker&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;do not think I can chide you&mdash;I
      know what it is to love in vain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In vain!&mdash;but why in vain?&rdquo; exclaimed the younger Spencer, with a
      vehemence that had in it something of both agony and fierceness. &ldquo;She may
      love me&mdash;she shall love me!&rdquo; and almost for the first time in his
      life, the proud consciousness of his rare gifts of person spoke in his
      kindled eye and dilated stature. &ldquo;Do they not say that Nature has been
      favourable to me?&mdash;What rival have I here?&mdash;Is she not young?&mdash;And
      (sinking his voice till it almost breathed like music) is not love
      contagious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not doubt that she may love you&mdash;who would not?&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;the
      parents, will they ever consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay!&rdquo; answered the lover, as with that inconsistency common to passion,
      he now argued stubbornly against those fears in another to which he had
      just before yielded in himself,&mdash;&ldquo;Nay!&mdash;after all, am I not of
      their own blood?&mdash;Do I not come from the elder branch?&mdash;Was I
      not reared in equal luxury and with higher hopes?&mdash;And my mother&mdash;my
      poor mother&mdash;did she not to the last maintain our birthright&mdash;her
      own honour?&mdash;Has not accident or law unjustly stripped us of our true
      station?&mdash;Is it not for us to forgive spoliation?&mdash;Am I not, in
      fact, the person who descends, who forgets the wrongs of the dead&mdash;the
      heritage of the living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man had never yet assumed this tone&mdash;had never yet shown
      that he looked back to the history connected with his birth with the
      feelings of resentment and the remembrance of wrong. It was a tone
      contrary to his habitual calm and contentment&mdash;it struck forcibly on
      his listener&mdash;and the elder Spencer was silent for some moments
      before he replied, &ldquo;If you feel thus (and it is natural), you have yet
      stronger reason to struggle against this unhappy affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been conscious of that, sir,&rdquo; replied the young man, mournfully.
      &ldquo;I have struggled!&mdash;and I say again it is in vain! I turn, then, to
      face the obstacles! My birth&mdash;let us suppose that the Beauforts
      overlook it. Did you not tell me that Mr. Beaufort wrote to inform you of
      the abrupt and intemperate visit of my brother&mdash;of his determination
      never to forgive it? I think I remember something of this years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true!&rdquo; said the guardian; &ldquo;and the conduct of that brother is, in
      fact, the true cause why you never ought to reassume your proper name!&mdash;never
      to divulge it, even to the family with whom you connect yourself by
      marriage; but, above all, to the Beauforts, who for that cause, if that
      cause alone, would reject your suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man groaned&mdash;placed one hand before his eyes, and with the
      other grasped his guardian&rsquo;s arm convulsively, as if to check him from
      proceeding farther; but the good man, not divining his meaning, and
      absorbed in his subject, went on, irritating the wound he had touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect!&mdash;your brother in boyhood&mdash;in the dying hours of his
      mother, scarcely saved from the crime of a thief, flying from a friendly
      pursuit with a notorious reprobate; afterwards implicated in some
      discreditable transaction about a horse, rejecting all&mdash;every hand
      that could save him, clinging by choice to the lowest companions and the
      meanest-habits, disappearing from the country, and last seen, ten years
      ago&mdash;the beard not yet on his chin&mdash;with that same reprobate of
      whom I have spoken, in Paris; a day or so only before his companion, a
      coiner&mdash;a murderer&mdash;fell by the hands of the police! You
      remember that when, in your seventeenth year, you evinced some desire to
      retake your name&mdash;nay, even to re-find that guilty brother&mdash;I
      placed before you, as a sad and terrible duty, the newspaper that
      contained the particulars of the death and the former adventures of that
      wretched accomplice, the notorious Gawtrey. And,&mdash;telling you that
      Mr. Beaufort had long since written to inform me that his own son and Lord
      Lilburne had seen your brother in company with the miscreant just before
      his fate&mdash;nay, was, in all probability, the very youth described in
      the account as found in his chamber and escaping the pursuit&mdash;I asked
      you if you would now venture to leave that disguise&mdash;that shelter
      under which you would for ever be safe from the opprobrium of the world&mdash;from
      the shame that, sooner or later, your brother must bring upon your name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true&mdash;it is true!&rdquo; said the pretended nephew, in a tone of
      great anguish, and with trembling lips which the blood had forsaken.
      &ldquo;Horrible to look either to his past or his future! But&mdash;but&mdash;we
      have heard of him no more&mdash;no one ever has learned his fate. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&rdquo;
       (and he seemed to breathe more freely)&mdash;&ldquo;my brother is no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And poor Catherine&mdash;and poor Philip&mdash;-had it come to this? Did
      the one brother feel a sentiment of release, of joy, in conjecturing the
      death&mdash;perhaps the death of violence and shame&mdash;of his
      fellow-orphan? Mr. Spencer shook his head doubtingly, but made no reply.
      The young man sighed heavily, and strode on for several paces in advance
      of his protector, then, turning back, he laid his hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said in a low voice and with downcast eyes, &ldquo;you are right: this
      disguise&mdash;this false name&mdash;must be for ever borne! Why need the
      Beauforts, then, ever know who and what I am? Why not as your nephew&mdash;nephew
      to one so respected and exemplary&mdash;proffer my claims and plead my
      cause?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are proud&mdash;so it is said&mdash;and worldly;&mdash;you know my
      family was in trade&mdash;still&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; and here Mr. Spencer
      broke off from a tone of doubt into that of despondency, &ldquo;but, recollect,
      though Mrs. Beaufort may not remember the circumstance, both her husband
      and her son have seen me&mdash;have known my name. Will they not suspect,
      when once introduced to you, the stratagem that has been adopted?&mdash;Nay,
      has it not been from that very fear that you have wished me to shun the
      acquaintance of the family? Both Mr. Beaufort and Arthur saw you in
      childhood, and their suspicion once aroused, they may recognise you at
      once; your features are developed, but not altogether changed. Come, come!&mdash;my
      adopted, my dear son, shake off this fantasy betimes: let us change the
      scene: I will travel with you&mdash;read with you&mdash;go where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the lover, smiting his breast, &ldquo;you are ever
      kind, compassionate, generous; but do not&mdash;do not rob me of hope. I
      have never&mdash;thanks to you&mdash;felt, save in a momentary dejection,
      the curse of my birth. Now how heavily it falls! Where shall I look for
      comfort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the sound of a bell broke over the translucent air and the
      slumbering lake: it was the bell that every eve and morn summoned that
      innocent and pious family to prayer. The old man&rsquo;s face changed as he
      heard it&mdash;changed from its customary indolent, absent, listless
      aspect, into an expression of dignity, even of animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; he said, pointing upwards; &ldquo;Hark! it chides you. Who shall say,
      &lsquo;Where shall I look for comfort&rsquo; while God is in the heavens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man, habituated to the faith and observance of religion, till
      they had pervaded his whole nature, bowed his head in rebuke; a few tears
      stole from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, father&mdash;,&rdquo; he said tenderly, giving emphasis to the
      deserved and endearing name. &ldquo;I am comforted already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, side by side, silently and noiselessly, the young and the old man
      glided back to the house. When they gained the quiet room in which the
      family usually assembled, the sisters and servants were already gathered
      round the table. They knelt as the loiterers entered. It was the wonted
      duty of the younger Spencer to read the prayers; and, as he now did so,
      his graceful countenance more hushed, his sweet voice more earnest than
      usual, in its accents: who that heard could have deemed the heart within
      convulsed by such stormy passions? Or was it not in that hour&mdash;that
      solemn commune&mdash;soothed from its woe? O beneficent Creator! thou who
      inspirest all the tribes of earth with the desire to pray, hast Thou not,
      in that divinest instinct, bestowed on us the happiest of Thy gifts?

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Bertram. I mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of
   it hereafter.

   &ldquo;1st Soldier. Do you know this Captain Dumain?&rdquo;
                     All&rsquo;s Well that Ends Well.
</pre>
    <p>
      One evening, some weeks after the date of the last chapter, Mr. Robert
      Beaufort sat alone in his house in Berkeley Square. He had arrived that
      morning from Beaufort Court, on his way to Winandermere, to which he was
      summoned by a letter from his wife. That year was an agitated and eventful
      epoch in England; and Mr. Beaufort had recently gone through the bustle of
      an election&mdash;not, indeed, contested; for his popularity and his
      property defied all rivalry in his own county.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rich man had just dined, and was seated in lazy enjoyment by the side
      of the fire, which he had had lighted, less for the warmth&mdash;though it
      was then September&mdash;than for the companionship;&mdash;engaged in
      finishing his madeira, and, with half-closed eyes, munching his devilled
      biscuits. &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; he soliloquised while thus employed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      exactly what to do,&mdash;my wife ought to decide matters where the girl
      is concerned; a son is another affair&mdash;that&rsquo;s the use of a wife.
      Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said a fat servant, opening the door, &ldquo;a gentleman wishes to see
      you upon very particular business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business at this hour! Tell him to go to Mr. Blackwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay! perhaps he is a constituent, Simmons. Ask him if he belongs to the
      county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great estate is a great plague,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Beaufort; &ldquo;so is a great
      constituency. It is pleasanter, after all, to be in the House of Lords. I
      suppose I could if I wished; but then one must rat&mdash;that&rsquo;s a bore. I
      will consult Lilburne. Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant re-appeared. &ldquo;Sir, he says he does belong to the county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in!&mdash;What sort of a person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of gentleman, sir; that is,&rdquo; continued the butler, mindful of five
      shillings just slipped within his palm by the stranger, &ldquo;quite the
      gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More wine, then&mdash;stir up the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the visitor was ushered into the apartment. He was a man
      between fifty and sixty, but still aiming at the appearance of youth. His
      dress evinced military pretensions; consisting of a blue coat, buttoned up
      to the chin, a black stock, loose trousers of the fashion called Cossacks,
      and brass spurs. He wore a wig, of great luxuriance in curl and rich
      auburn in hue; with large whiskers of the same colour slightly tinged with
      grey at the roots. By the imperfect light of the room it was not
      perceptible that the clothes were somewhat threadbare, and that the boots,
      cracked at the side, admitted glimpses of no very white hosiery within.
      Mr. Beaufort, reluctantly rising from his repose and gladly sinking back
      to it, motioned to a chair, and put on a doleful and doubtful semi-smile
      of welcome. The servant placed the wine and glasses before the stranger;&mdash;the
      host and visitor were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, languidly, &ldquo;you are from &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;shire;
      I suppose about the canal,&mdash;may I offer you a glass of wine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most hauppy, sir&mdash;your health!&rdquo; and the stranger, with evident
      satisfaction, tossed off a bumper to so complimentary a toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the canal?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, no! You parliament gentlemen must hauve a vaust deal of trouble
      on your haunds&mdash;very foine property I understaund yours is, sir. Sir,
      allow me to drink the health of your good lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Mr.&mdash;, Mr.&mdash;, what did you say your name was?&mdash;I
      beg you a thousand pardons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offaunce in the least, sir; no ceremony with me&mdash;this is
      perticler good madeira!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask how I can serve you?&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, struggling between the
      sense of annoyance and the fear to be uncivil. &ldquo;And pray, had I the honour
      of your vote in the last election!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, no! It&rsquo;s mauny years since I have been in your part of the
      world, though I was born there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t exactly see&mdash;&rdquo; began Mr. Beaufort, and stopped with
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I call on you,&rdquo; put in the stranger, tapping his boots with his cane;
      and then recognising the rents, he thrust both feet under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that; but at this hour I am seldom at leisure&mdash;not but
      what I am always at the service of a constituent, that is, a voter! Mr.&mdash;,
      I beg your pardon, I did not catch your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, helping himself to a third glass of wine;
      &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a health to your young folk! And now to business.&rdquo; Here the
      visitor, drawing his chair nearer to his host, assuming a more grave
      aspect, and dropping something of his stilted pronunciation, continued,
      &ldquo;You had a brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, with a very changed countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that brother had a wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Had a cannon gone off in the ear of Mr. Robert Beaufort, it could not have
      shocked or stunned him more than that simple word with which his companion
      closed his sentence. He fell back in his chair&mdash;his lips apart, his
      eyes fixed on the stranger. He sought to speak, but his tongue clove to
      his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wife had two sons, born in wedlock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; cried Mr. Beaufort, finding a voice at length, and
      springing to his feet. &ldquo;And who are you, sir? and what do you mean by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the stranger, perfectly unconcerned, and regaining the
      dignity of his haw-haw enunciation, &ldquo;better not let the servants hear
      aunything. For my pawt, I think servants hauve the longest pair of ears of
      auny persons, not excepting jauckasses; their ears stretch from the
      pauntry to the parlour. Hush, sir!&mdash;perticler good madeira, this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, struggling to preserve, or rather recover, his
      temper, &ldquo;your conduct is exceedingly strange; but allow me to say that you
      are wholly misinformed. My brother never did marry; and if you have
      anything to say on behalf of those young men&mdash;his natural sons&mdash;I
      refer you to my solicitor, Mr. Blackwell, of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. I wish you a
      good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&mdash;the same to you&mdash;I won&rsquo;t trouble you auny farther; it was
      only out of koindness I called&mdash;I am not used to be treated so&mdash;sir,
      I am in his maujesty&rsquo;s service&mdash;sir, you will foind that the witness
      of the marriage is forthcoming; you will think of me then, and, perhaps,
      be sorry. But I&rsquo;ve done, &lsquo;Your most obedient humble, sir!&rsquo;&rdquo; And the
      stranger, with a flourish of his hand, turned to the door. At the sight of
      this determination on the part of his strange guest, a cold, uneasy, vague
      presentiment seized Mr. Beaufort. There, not flashed, but rather froze,
      across him the recollection of his brother&rsquo;s emphatic but disbelieved
      assurances&mdash;of Catherine&rsquo;s obstinate assertion of her son&rsquo;s alleged
      rights&mdash;rights which her lawsuit, undertaken on her own behalf, had
      not compromised;&mdash;a fresh lawsuit might be instituted by the son, and
      the evidence which had been wanting in the former suit might be found at
      last. With this remembrance and these reflections came a horrible train of
      shadowy fears,&mdash;witnesses, verdict, surrender, spoliation&mdash;arrears&mdash;ruin!
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, who had gained the door, turned back and looked at him with a
      complacent, half-triumphant leer upon his impudent, reckless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; then said Mr. Beaufort, mildly, &ldquo;I repeat that you had better see
      Mr. Blackwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tempter saw his triumph. &ldquo;I have a secret to communicate which it is
      best for you to keep snug. How mauny people do you wish me to see about
      it? Come, sir, there is no need of a lawyer; or, if you think so, tell him
      yourself. Now or never, Mr. Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can have no objection to hear anything you have to say, sir,&rdquo; said the
      rich man, yet more mildly than before; and then added, with a forced
      smile, &ldquo;though my rights are already too confirmed to admit of a doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without heeding the last assertion, the stranger coolly walked back,
      resumed his seat, and, placing both arms on the table and looking Mr.
      Beaufort full in the face, thus proceeded,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, of the marriage between Philip Beaufort and Catherine Morton there
      were two witnesses: the one is dead, the other went abroad&mdash;the last
      is alive still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, who, not naturally deficient in cunning and
      sense, felt every faculty now prodigiously sharpened, and was resolved to
      know the precise grounds for alarm,&mdash;&ldquo;if so, why did not the man&mdash;it
      was a servant, sir, a man-servant, whom Mrs. Morton pretended to rely on&mdash;appear
      on the trial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, I say, he was abroad and could not be found; or, the search
      after him miscaurried, from clumsy management and a lack of the rhino.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort&mdash;&ldquo;one witness&mdash;one witness, observe,
      there is only one!&mdash;does not alarm me much. It is not what a man
      deposes, it is what a jury believe, sir! Moreover, what has become of the
      young men? They have never been heard of for years. They are probably
      dead; if so, I am heir-at-law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where one of them is to be found at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The elder?&mdash;Philip?&rdquo; asked Mr. Beaufort anxiously, and with a
      fearful remembrance of the energetic and vehement character prematurely
      exhibited by his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pawdon me! I need not aunswer that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir! a lawsuit of this nature, against one in possession, is very
      doubtful, and,&rdquo; added the rich man, drawing himself up&mdash;&ldquo;and, perhaps
      very expensive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young man I speak of does not want friends, who will not grudge the
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, rising and placing his back to the fire&mdash;&ldquo;sir!
      what is your object in this communication? Do you come, on the part of the
      young man, to propose a compromise? If so, be plain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come on my own pawt. It rests with you to say if the young men shall
      never know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred a year as long as the secret is kept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how can you prove that there is a secret, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By producing the witness if you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he go halves in the L500. a year?&rdquo; asked Mr. Beaufort artfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is moy affair, sir,&rdquo; replied the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you say,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Beaufort, &ldquo;is so extraordinary&mdash;so
      unexpected, and still, to me, seems so improbable, that I must have time
      to consider. If you will call on me in a week, and produce your facts, I
      will give you my answer. I am not the man, sir, to wish to keep any one
      out of his true rights, but I will not yield, on the other hand, to
      imposture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to keep them out of their rights, I&rsquo;d best go and tell
      my young gentlemen,&rdquo; said the stranger, with cool impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I must have time,&rdquo; repeated Beaufort, disconcerted. &ldquo;Besides,
      I have not myself alone to look to, sir,&rdquo; he added, with dignified
      emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;I am a father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This day week I will call on you again. Good evening, Mr. Beaufort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the man stretched out his hand with an air of amicable condescension.
      The respectable Mr. Beaufort changed colour, hesitated, and finally
      suffered two fingers to be enticed into the grasp of the visitor, whom he
      ardently wished at that bourne whence no visitor returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger smiled, stalked to the door, laid his finger on his lip,
      winked knowingly, and vanished, leaving Mr. Beaufort a prey to such
      feelings of uneasiness, dread, and terror, as may be experienced by a man
      whom, on some inch or two of slippery rock, the tides have suddenly
      surrounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained perfectly still for some moments, and then glancing round the
      dim and spacious room, his eyes took in all the evidences of luxury and
      wealth which it betrayed. Above the huge sideboard, that on festive days
      groaned beneath the hoarded weight of the silver heirlooms of the
      Beauforts, hung, in its gilded frame, a large picture of the family seat,
      with the stately porticoes&mdash;the noble park&mdash;the groups of deer;
      and around the wall, interspersed here and there with ancestral portraits
      of knight and dame, long since gathered to their rest, were placed
      masterpieces of the Italian and Flemish art, which generation after
      generation had slowly accumulated, till the Beaufort Collection had become
      the theme of connoisseurs and the study of young genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      The still room, the dumb pictures&mdash;even the heavy sideboard seemed to
      gain voice, and speak to him audibly. He thrust his hand into the folds of
      his waistcoat, and griped his own flesh convulsively; then, striding to
      and fro the apartment, he endeavoured to re-collect his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not consult Mrs. Beaufort,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;no&mdash;no,&mdash;she
      is a fool! Besides, she&rsquo;s not in the way. No time to lose&mdash;I will go
      to Lilburne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had that thought crossed him than he hastened to put it into
      execution. He rang for his hat and gloves and sallied out on foot to Lord
      Lilburne&rsquo;s house in Park Lane,&mdash;the distance was short, and
      impatience has long strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew Lord Lilburne was in town, for that personage loved London for its
      own sake; and even in September he would have said with the old Duke of
      Queensberry, when some one observed that London was very empty&mdash;&ldquo;Yes;
      but it is fuller than the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort found Lord Lilburne reclined on a sofa, by the open window of
      his drawing-room, beyond which the early stars shone upon the glimmering
      trees and silver turf of the deserted park. Unlike the simple dessert of
      his respectable brother-in-law, the costliest fruits, the richest wines of
      France, graced the small table placed beside his sofa; and as the starch
      man of forms and method entered the room at one door, a rustling silk,
      that vanished through the aperture of another, seemed to betray tokens of
      a tete-a-tete, probably more agreeable to Lilburne than the one with which
      only our narrative is concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been a curious study for such men as love to gaze upon the
      dark and wily features of human character, to have watched the contrast
      between the reciter and the listener, as Beaufort, with much
      circumlocution, much affected disdain and real anxiety, narrated the
      singular and ominous conversation between himself and his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant, in introducing Mr. Beaufort, had added to the light of the
      room; and the candles shone full on the face and form of Mr. Beaufort. All
      about that gentleman was so completely in unison with the world&rsquo;s forms
      and seemings, that there was something moral in the very sight of him!
      Since his accession of fortune he had grown less pale and less thin; the
      angles in his figure were filled up. On his brow there was no trace of
      younger passion. No able vice had ever sharpened the expression&mdash;no
      exhausting vice ever deepened the lines. He was the beau-ideal of a county
      member,&mdash;so sleek, so staid, so business-like; yet so clean, so neat,
      so much the gentleman. And now there was a kind of pathos in his grey
      hairs, his nervous smile, his agitated hands, his quick and uneasy
      transition of posture, the tremble of his voice. He would have appeared to
      those who saw, but heard not, The Good Man in trouble. Cold, motionless,
      speechless, seemingly apathetic, but in truth observant, still reclined on
      the sofa, his head thrown back, but one eye fixed on his companion, his
      hands clasped before him, Lord Lilburne listened; and in that repose,
      about his face, even about his person, might be read the history of how
      different a life and character! What native acuteness in the stealthy eye!
      What hardened resolve in the full nostril and firm lips! What sardonic
      contempt for all things in the intricate lines about the mouth. What
      animal enjoyment of all things so despised in that delicate nervous
      system, which, combined with original vigour of constitution, yet betrayed
      itself in the veins on the hands and temples, the occasional quiver of the
      upper lip! His was the frame above all others the most alive to pleasure&mdash;deep-chested,
      compact, sinewy, but thin to leanness&mdash;delicate in its texture and
      extremities, almost to effeminacy. The indifference of the posture, the
      very habit of the dress&mdash;not slovenly, indeed, but easy, loose,
      careless&mdash;seemed to speak of the man&rsquo;s manner of thought and life&mdash;his
      profound disdain of externals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till Beaufort had concluded did Lord Lilburne change his position or
      open his lips; and then, turning to his brother-in-law his calm face, he
      said drily,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always thought your brother had married that woman; he was the sort of
      man to do it. Besides, why should she have gone to law without a vestige
      of proof, unless she was convinced of her rights? Imposture never proceeds
      without some evidence. Innocence, like a fool as it is, fancies it has
      only to speak to be believed. But there is no cause for alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No cause!&mdash;And yet you think there was a marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite clear,&rdquo; continued Lilburne, without heeding this
      interruption; &ldquo;that the man, whatever his evidence, has not got sufficient
      proofs. If he had, he would go to the young men rather than you: it is
      evident that they would promise infinitely larger rewards than he could
      expect from yourself. Men are always more generous with what they expect
      than with what they have. All rogues know this. &lsquo;Tis the way Jews and
      usurers thrive upon heirs rather than possessors; &lsquo;tis the philosophy of
      post-obits. I dare say the man has found out the real witness of the
      marriage, but ascertained, also, that the testimony of that witness would
      not suffice to dispossess you. He might be discredited&mdash;rich men have
      a way sometimes of discrediting poor witnesses. Mind, he says nothing of
      the lost copy of the register&mdash;whatever may be the value of that
      document, which I am not lawyer enough to say&mdash;of any letters of your
      brother avowing the marriage. Consider, the register itself is destroyed&mdash;the
      clergyman dead. Pooh! make yourself easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, much comforted; &ldquo;what a memory you have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. Your wife is my sister&mdash;I hate poor relations&mdash;and I
      was therefore much interested in your accession and your lawsuit. No&mdash;you
      may feel&mdash;at rest on this matter, so far as a successful lawsuit is
      concerned. The next question is, Will you have a lawsuit at all? and is it
      worth while buying this fellow? That I can&rsquo;t say unless I see him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to Heaven you would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very willingly: &lsquo;tis a sort of thing I like&mdash;I&rsquo;m fond of dealing
      with rogues&mdash;it amuses me. This day week? I&rsquo;ll be at your house&mdash;your
      proxy; I shall do better than Blackwell. And since you say you are wanted
      at the Lakes, go down, and leave all to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks. I can&rsquo;t say how grateful I am. You certainly are the
      kindest and cleverest person in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t think worse of the world&rsquo;s cleverness and kindness than I do,&rdquo;
       was Lilburne&rsquo;s rather ambiguous answer to the compliment. &ldquo;But why does my
      sister want to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot!&mdash;here is her letter. I was going to ask your advice in
      this too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lilburne took the letter, and glanced over it with the rapid eye of a
      man accustomed to seize in everything the main gist and pith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An offer to my pretty niece&mdash;Mr. Spencer&mdash;requires no fortune&mdash;his
      uncle will settle all his own&mdash;(poor silly old man!) All! Why that&rsquo;s
      only L1000. a year. You don&rsquo;t think much of this, eh? How my sister can
      even ask you about it puzzles me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, Lilburne,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, rather embarrassed, &ldquo;there is
      no question of fortune&mdash;nothing to go out of the family; and, really,
      Arthur is so expensive, and, if she were to marry well, I could not give
      her less than fifteen or twenty thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&mdash;I see&mdash;every man to his taste: here a daughter&mdash;there
      a dowry. You are devilish fond of money, Beaufort. Any pleasure in
      avarice,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort coloured very much at the remark and the question, and,
      forcing a smile, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are severe. But you don&rsquo;t know what it is to be father to a young
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then a great many young women have told me sad fibs! But you are right in
      your sense of the phrase. No, I never had an heir apparent, thank Heaven!
      No children imposed upon me by law&mdash;natural enemies, to count the
      years between the bells that ring for their majority, and those that will
      toll for my decease. It is enough for me that I have a brother and a
      sister&mdash;that my brother&rsquo;s son will inherit my estates&mdash;and that,
      in the meantime, he grudges me every tick in that clock. What then? If he
      had been my uncle, I had done the same. Meanwhile, I see as little of him
      as good breeding will permit. On the face of a rich man&rsquo;s heir is written
      the rich man&rsquo;s memento mori! But revenons a nos moutons. Yes, if you give
      your daughter no fortune, your death will be so much the more profitable
      to Arthur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you take such a very odd view of the matter,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort,
      exceedingly shocked. &ldquo;But I see you don&rsquo;t like the marriage; perhaps you
      are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I have no choice in the matter; I never interfere between father
      and children. If I had children myself, I will, however, tell you, for
      your comfort, that they might marry exactly as they pleased&mdash;I would
      never thwart them. I should be too happy to get them out of my way. If
      they married well, one would have all the credit; if ill, one would have
      an excuse to disown them. As I said before, I dislike poor relations.
      Though if Camilla lives at the Lakes when she is married, it is but a
      letter now and then; and that&rsquo;s your wife&rsquo;s trouble, not yours. But,
      Spencer&mdash;what Spencer!&mdash;what family? Was there not a Mr. Spencer
      who lived at Winandermere&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who went with us in search of these boys, to be sure. Very likely the
      same&mdash;nay, he must be so. I thought so at the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down to the Lakes to-morrow. You may hear something about your
      nephews;&rdquo; at that word Mr. Beaufort winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well to be forearmed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many thanks for all your counsel,&rdquo; said Beaufort, rising, and glad to
      escape; for though both he and his wife held the advice of Lord Lilburne
      in the highest reverence, they always smarted beneath the quiet and
      careless stings which accompanied the honey. Lord Lilburne was singular in
      this,&mdash;he would give to any one who asked it, but especially a
      relation, the best advice in his power; and none gave better, that is,
      more worldly advice. Thus, without the least benevolence, he was often of
      the greatest service; but he could not help mixing up the draught with as
      much aloes and bitter-apple as possible. His intellect delighted in
      exhibiting itself even gratuitously. His heart equally delighted in that
      only cruelty which polished life leaves to its tyrants towards their
      equals,&mdash;thrusting pins into the feelings and breaking self-love upon
      the wheel. But just as Mr. Beaufort had drawn on his gloves and gained the
      doorway, a thought seemed to strike Lord Lilburne:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you understand that when I promised I would try and
      settle the matter for you, I only meant that I would learn the exact
      causes you have for alarm on the one hand, or for a compromise with this
      fellow on the other. If the last be advisable you are aware that I cannot
      interfere. I might get into a scrape; and Beaufort Court is not my
      property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am plain enough, too. If there is money to be given it is given in
      order to defeat what is called justice&mdash;to keep these nephews of
      yours out of their inheritance. Now, should this ever come to light, it
      would have an ugly appearance. They who risk the blame must be the persons
      who possess the estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think it dishonourable or dishonest&mdash;&rdquo; said Beaufort,
      irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! I never can advise as to the feelings; I can only advise as to the
      policy. If you don&rsquo;t think there ever was a marriage, it may, still, be
      honest in you to prevent the bore of a lawsuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he can prove to me that they were married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Lilburne, raising his eyebrows with a slight expression of
      contemptuous impatience; &ldquo;it rests on yourself whether or not he prove it
      to YOUR satisfaction! For my part, as a third person, I am persuaded the
      marriage did take place. But if I had Beaufort Court, my convictions would
      be all the other way. You understand. I am too happy to serve you. But no
      man can be expected to jeopardise his character, or coquet with the law,
      unless it be for his own individual interest. Then, of course, he must
      judge for himself. Adieu! I expect some friends foreigners&mdash;Carlists&mdash;to
      whist. You won&rsquo;t join them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never play, you know. You will write to me at Winandermere: and, at all
      events, you will keep off the man till I return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaufort, whom the latter part of the conversation had comforted far less
      than the former, hesitated, and turned the door-handle three or four
      times; but, glancing towards his brother-in-law, he saw in that cold face
      so little sympathy in the struggle between interest and conscience, that
      he judged it best to withdraw at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was gone, Lilburne summoned his valet, who had lived with
      him many years, and who was his confidant in all the adventurous
      gallantries with which he still enlivened the autumn of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dykeman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have let out that lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at home if she calls again. She is stupid; she cannot get the
      girl to come to her again. I shall trust you with an adventure, Dykeman&mdash;an
      adventure that will remind you of our young days, man. This charming
      creature&mdash;I tell you she is irresistible&mdash;her very oddities
      bewitch me. You must&mdash;well, you look uneasy. What would you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I have found out more about her&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The valet drew near and whispered something in his master&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are idiots who say it, then,&rdquo; answered Lilburne. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; faltered the
      man, with the shame of humanity on his face, &ldquo;she is not worthy your
      lordship&rsquo;s notice&mdash;a poor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know she is poor; and, for that reason, there can be no
      difficulty, if the thing is properly managed. You never, perhaps, heard of
      a certain Philip, king of Macedon; but I will tell you what he once said,
      as well as I can remember it: &lsquo;Lead an ass with a pannier of gold; send
      the ass through the gates of a city, and all the sentinels will run away.&rsquo; 
      Poor!&mdash;where there is love, there is charity also, Dykeman. Besides&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Lilburne&rsquo;s countenance assumed a sudden aspect of dark and angry
      passion,&mdash;he broke off abruptly, rose, and paced the room, muttering
      to himself. Suddenly he stopped, and put his hand to his hip, as an
      expression of pain again altered the character of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The limb pains me still! Dykeman&mdash;I was scarce twenty-one&mdash;when
      I became a cripple for life.&rdquo; He paused, drew a long breath, smiled,
      rubbed his hands gently, and added: &ldquo;Never fear&mdash;you shall be the
      ass; and thus Philip of Macedon begins to fill the pannier.&rdquo; And he tossed
      his purse into the hands of the valet, whose face seemed to lose its
      anxious embarrassment at the touch of the gold. Lilburne glanced at him
      with a quiet sneer: &ldquo;Go!&mdash;I will give you my orders when I undress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he repeated to himself, &ldquo;the limb pains me still. But he died!&mdash;shot
      as a man would shoot a jay or a polecat!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the newspaper still in that drawer. He died an outcast&mdash;a
      felon&mdash;a murderer! And I blasted his name&mdash;and I seduced his
      mistress&mdash;and I&mdash;am John Lord Lilburne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About ten o&rsquo;clock, some half-a-dozen of those gay lovers of London, who,
      like Lilburne, remain faithful to its charms when more vulgar worshippers
      desert its sunburnt streets&mdash;mostly single men&mdash;mostly men of
      middle age&mdash;dropped in. And soon after came three or four high-born
      foreigners, who had followed into England the exile of the unfortunate
      Charles X. Their looks, at once proud and sad&mdash;their moustaches
      curled downward&mdash;their beards permitted to grow&mdash;made at first a
      strong contrast with the smooth gay Englishmen. But Lilburne, who was fond
      of French society, and who, when he pleased, could be courteous and
      agreeable, soon placed the exiles at their ease; and, in the excitement of
      high play, all differences of mood and humour speedily vanished. Morning
      was in the skies before they sat down to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been very fortunate to-night, milord,&rdquo; said one of the
      Frenchmen, with an envious tone of congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, indeed,&rdquo; said another, who, having been several times his host&rsquo;s
      partner, had won largely, &ldquo;you are the finest player, milord, I ever
      encountered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always excepting Monsieur Deschapelles and&mdash;,&rdquo; replied Lilburne,
      indifferently. And, turning the conversation, he asked one of the guests
      why he had not introduced him to a French officer of merit and
      distinction; &ldquo;With whom,&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne, &ldquo;I understand that you are
      intimate, and of whom I hear your countrymen very often speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean De Vaudemont. Poor fellow!&rdquo; said a middle-aged Frenchman, of a
      graver appearance than the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why &lsquo;poor fellow!&rsquo; Monsieur de Liancourt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was rising so high before the revolution. There was not a braver
      officer in the army. But he is but a soldier of fortune, and his career is
      closed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till the Bourbons return,&rdquo; said another Carlist, playing with his
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will really honour me much by introducing me to him,&rdquo; said Lord
      Lilburne. &ldquo;De Vaudemont&mdash;it is a good name,&mdash;perhaps, too, he
      plays at whist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed one of the Frenchmen, &ldquo;I am by no means sure that he has
      the best right in the world to the name. &lsquo;Tis a strange story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I hear it?&rdquo; asked the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. It is briefly this: There was an old Vicomte de Vaudemont
      about Paris; of good birth, but extremely poor&mdash;a mauvais sujet. He
      had already had two wives, and run through their fortunes. Being old and
      ugly, and men who survive two wives having a bad reputation among
      marriageable ladies at Paris, he found it difficult to get a third.
      Despairing of the noblesse he went among the bourgeoisie with that hope.
      His family were kept in perpetual fear of a ridiculous mesalliance. Among
      these relations was Madame de Merville, whom you may have heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Merville! Ah, yes! Handsome, was she not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. Madame de Merville, whose failing was pride, was known more
      than once to have bought off the matrimonial inclinations of the amorous
      vicomte. Suddenly there appeared in her circles a very handsome young man.
      He was presented formally to her friends as the son of the Vicomte de
      Vaudemont by his second marriage with an English lady, brought up in
      England, and now for the first time publicly acknowledged. Some scandal
      was circulated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; interrupted Monsieur de Liancourt, very gravely, &ldquo;the scandal was
      such as all honourable men must stigmatise and despise&mdash;it was only
      to be traced to some lying lackey&mdash;a scandal that the young man was
      already the lover of a woman of stainless reputation the very first day
      that he entered Paris! I answer for the falsity of that report. But that
      report I own was one that decided not only Madame de Merville, who was a
      sensitive&mdash;too sensitive a person, but my friend young Vaudemont, to
      a marriage, from the pecuniary advantages of which he was too
      high-spirited not to shrink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne, &ldquo;then this young De Vaudemont married Madame
      de Merville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Liancourt somewhat sadly, &ldquo;it was not so decreed; for
      Vaudemont, with a feeling which belongs to a gentleman, and which I
      honour, while deeply and gratefully attached to Madame de Merville,
      desired that he might first win for himself some honourable distinction
      before he claimed a hand to which men of fortunes so much higher had
      aspired in vain. I am not ashamed,&rdquo; he added, after a slight pause, &ldquo;to
      say that I had been one of the rejected suitors, and that I still revere
      the memory of Eugenie de Merville. The young man, therefore, was to have
      entered my regiment. Before, however, he had joined it, and while yet in
      the full flush of a young man&rsquo;s love for a woman formed to excite the
      strongest attachment, she&mdash;she&mdash;-&rdquo; The Frenchman&rsquo;s voice
      trembled, and he resumed with affected composure: &ldquo;Madame de Merville, who
      had the best and kindest heart that ever beat in a human breast, learned
      one day that there was a poor widow in the garret of the hotel she
      inhabited who was dangerously ill&mdash;without medicine and without food&mdash;having
      lost her only friend and supporter in her husband some time before. In the
      impulse of the moment, Madame de Merville herself attended this widow&mdash;caught
      the fever that preyed upon her&mdash;was confined to her bed ten days&mdash;and
      died as she had lived, in serving others and forgetting self.&mdash;And so
      much, sir, for the scandal you spoke of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A warning,&rdquo; observed Lord Lilburne, &ldquo;against trifling with one&rsquo;s health
      by that vanity of parading a kind heart, which is called charity. If
      charity, mon cher, begins at home, it is in the drawing-room, not the
      garret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman looked at his host in some disdain, bit his lip, and was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still,&rdquo; resumed Lord Lilburne, &ldquo;still it is so probable that your old
      vicomte had a son; and I can so perfectly understand why he did not wish
      to be embarrassed with him as long as he could help it, that I do not
      understand why there should be any doubt of the younger De Vaudemont&rsquo;s
      parentage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the Frenchman who had first commenced the narrative,&mdash;&ldquo;because
      the young man refused to take the legal steps to proclaim his birth and
      naturalise himself a Frenchman; because, no sooner was Madame de Merville
      dead than he forsook the father he had so newly discovered&mdash;forsook
      France, and entered with some other officers, under the brave, &amp;m&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      in the service of one of the native princes of India.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps he was poor,&rdquo; observed Lord Lilburne. &ldquo;A father is a very
      good thing, and a country is a very good thing, but still a man must have
      money; and if your father does not do much for you, somehow or other, your
      country generally follows his example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said Liancourt, &ldquo;my friend here has forgotten to say that
      Madame de Merville had by deed of gift; (though unknown to her lover),
      before her death, made over to young Vaudemont the bulk of her fortune;
      and that, when he was informed of this donation after her decease, and
      sufficiently recovered from the stupor of his grief, he summoned her
      relations round him, declared that her memory was too dear to him for
      wealth to console him for her loss, and reserving to himself but a modest
      and bare sufficiency for the common necessaries of a gentleman, he divided
      the rest amongst them, and repaired to the East; not only to conquer his
      sorrow by the novelty and stir of an exciting life, but to carve out with
      his own hand the reputation of an honourable and brave man. My friend
      remembered the scandal long buried&mdash;he forgot the generous action.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend, you see, my dear Monsieur de Liancourt,&rdquo; remarked Lilburne,
      &ldquo;is more a man of the world than you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was just going to observe,&rdquo; said the friend thus referred to, &ldquo;that
      that very action seemed to confirm the rumour that there had been some
      little manoeuvring as to this unexpected addition to the name of De
      Vaudemont; for, if himself related to Madame de Merville, why have such
      scruples to receive her gift?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very shrewd remark,&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne, looking with some respect at
      the speaker; &ldquo;and I own that it is a very unaccountable proceeding, and
      one of which I don&rsquo;t think you or I would ever have been guilty. Well, and
      the old Vicomte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not live long!&rdquo; said the Frenchman, evidently gratified by his host&rsquo;s
      compliment, while Liancourt threw himself back in his chair in grave
      displeasure. &ldquo;The young man remained some years in India, and when he
      returned to Paris, our friend here, Monsieur de Liancourt (then in favour
      with Charles X.), and Madame de Merville&rsquo;s relations took him up. He had
      already acquired a reputation in this foreign service, and he obtained a
      place at the court, and a commission in the king&rsquo;s guards. I allow that he
      would certainly have made a career, had it not been for the Three Days. As
      it is, you see him in London, like the rest of us, an exile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose, without a sous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I believe that he had still saved, and even augmented, in India, the
      portion he allotted to himself from Madame de Merville&rsquo;s bequest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he don&rsquo;t play whist, he ought to play it,&rdquo; said Lilburne. &ldquo;You
      have roused my curiosity; I hope you will let me make his acquaintance,
      Monsieur de Liancourt. I am no politician, but allow me to propose this
      toast, &lsquo;Success to those who have the wit to plan, and the strength to
      execute.&rsquo; In other words, &lsquo;the Right Divine!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards the guests retired.

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Ros. Happily, he&rsquo;s the second time come to them.&rdquo;&mdash;Hamlet.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was the evening after that in which the conversations recorded in our
      last chapter were held;&mdash;evening in the quiet suburb of H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      The desertion and silence of the metropolis in September had extended to
      its neighbouring hamlets;&mdash;a village in the heart of the country
      could scarcely have seemed more still; the lamps were lighted, many of the
      shops already closed, a few of the sober couples and retired spinsters of
      the place might, here and there, be seen slowly wandering homeward after
      their evening walk: two or three dogs, in spite of the prohibitions of the
      magistrates placarded on the walls,&mdash;(manifestoes which threatened
      with death the dogs, and predicted more than ordinary madness to the
      public,)&mdash;were playing in the main road, disturbed from time to time
      as the slow coach, plying between the city and the suburb, crawled along
      the thoroughfare, or as the brisk mails whirled rapidly by, announced by
      the cloudy dust and the guard&rsquo;s lively horn. Gradually even these
      evidences of life ceased&mdash;the saunterers disappeared, the mails had
      passed, the dogs gave place to the later and more stealthy perambulations
      of their feline successors &ldquo;who love the moon.&rdquo; At unfrequent intervals,
      the more important shops&mdash;the linen-drapers&rsquo;, the chemists&rsquo;, and the
      gin-palace&mdash;still poured out across the shadowy road their streams of
      light from windows yet unclosed: but with these exceptions, the business
      of the place stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time there emerged from a milliner&rsquo;s house (shop, to outward
      appearance, it was not, evincing its gentility and its degree above the
      Capelocracy, to use a certain classical neologism, by a brass plate on an
      oak door, whereon was graven, &ldquo;Miss Semper, Milliner and Dressmaker, from
      Madame Devy,&rdquo;)&mdash;at this time, I say, and from this house there
      emerged the light and graceful form of a young female. She held in her
      left hand a little basket, of the contents of which (for it was empty) she
      had apparently just disposed; and, as she stepped across the road, the
      lamplight fell on a face in the first bloom of youth, and characterised by
      an expression of childlike innocence and candour. It was a face regularly
      and exquisitely lovely, yet something there was in the aspect that
      saddened you; you knew not why, for it was not sad itself; on the
      contrary, the lips smiled and the eyes sparkled. As she now glided along
      the shadowy street with a light, quick step, a man, who had hitherto been
      concealed by the portico of an attorney&rsquo;s house, advanced stealthily, and
      followed her at a little distance. Unconscious that she was dogged, and
      seemingly fearless of all danger, the girl went lightly on, swinging her
      basket playfully to and fro, and chaunting, in a low but musical tone,
      some verses that seemed rather to belong to the nursery than to that age
      which the fair singer had attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she came to an angle which the main street formed with a lane, narrow
      and partially lighted, a policeman, stationed there, looked hard at her,
      and then touched his hat with an air of respect, in which there seemed
      also a little of compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night to you,&rdquo; said the girl, passing him, and with a frank, gay
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I attend you home, Miss?&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? I am very well!&rdquo; answered the young woman, with an accent and
      look of innocent surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this time the man, who had hitherto followed her, gained the spot,
      and turned down the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the policeman; &ldquo;but it is getting dark, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is every night when I walk home, unless there&rsquo;s a moon.&mdash;Good-bye.&mdash;The
      moon,&rdquo; she repeated to herself, as she walked on, &ldquo;I used to be afraid of
      the moon when I was a little child;&rdquo; and then, after a pause, she
      murmured, in a low chaunt:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;&lsquo;The moon she is a wandering ghost,
        That walks in penance nightly;
        How sad she is, that wandering moon,
        For all she shines so brightly!

        &ldquo;&lsquo;I watched her eyes when I was young,
        Until they turned my brain,
        And now I often weep to think
        &lsquo;Twill ne&rsquo;er be right again.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As the murmur of these words died at a distance down the lane in which the
      girl had disappeared, the policeman, who had paused to listen, shook his
      head mournfully, and said, while he moved on,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing! they should not let her always go about by herself; and yet,
      who would harm her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the girl proceeded along the lane, which was skirted by small,
      but not mean houses, till it terminated in a cross-stile that admitted
      into a church yard. Here hung the last lamp in the path, and a few dim
      stars broke palely over the long grass, and scattered gravestones, without
      piercing the deep shadow which the church threw over a large portion of
      the sacred ground. Just as she passed the stile, the man, whom we have
      before noticed, and who had been leaning, as if waiting for some one,
      against the pales, approached, and said gently,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Miss! it is a lone place for one so beautiful as you are to be alone.
      You ought never to be on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stopped, and looked full, but without any alarm in her eyes, into
      the man&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; she said, with a half-peevish, half-kindly tone of command. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have been sent to speak to you by one who does know you, Miss&mdash;one
      who loves you to distraction&mdash;he has seen you before at Mrs. West&rsquo;s.
      He is so grieved to think you should walk&mdash;you ought, he says, to
      have every luxury&mdash;that he has sent his carriage for you. It is on
      the other side of the yard. Do come now;&rdquo; and he laid his hand, though
      very lightly, on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Mrs. West&rsquo;s!&rdquo; she said; and, for the first time, her voice and look
      showed fear. &ldquo;Go away directly! How dare you touch me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear Miss, you have no idea how my employer loves you, and how
      rich he is. See, he has sent you all this money; it is gold&mdash;real
      gold. You may have what you like, if you will but come. Now, don&rsquo;t be
      silly, Miss.&rdquo; The girl made no answer, but, with a sudden spring, passed
      the man, and ran lightly and rapidly along the path, in an opposite
      direction from that to which the tempter had pointed, when inviting her to
      the carriage. The man, surprised, but not baffled, reached her in an
      instant, and caught hold of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay! you must come&mdash;you must!&rdquo; he said, threateningly; and,
      loosening his grasp on her shawl, he threw his arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the girl, pleadingly, and apparently subdued, turning her
      fair, soft face upon her pursuer, and clasping her hands. &ldquo;Be quiet! Fanny
      is silly! No one is ever rude to poor Fanny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one will be rude to you, Miss,&rdquo; said the man, apparently touched;
      &ldquo;but I dare not go without you. You don&rsquo;t know what you refuse. Come;&rdquo; and
      he attempted gently to draw her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; said the girl, changing from supplication to anger, and raising
      her voice into a loud shriek, &ldquo;No! I will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then,&rdquo; interrupted the man, looking round anxiously, and, with a
      quick and dexterous movement he threw a large handkerchief over her face,
      and, as he held it fast to her lips with one hand, he lifted her from the
      ground. Still violently struggling, the girl contrived to remove the
      handkerchief, and once more her shriek of terror rang through the violated
      sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant a loud deep voice was heard, &ldquo;Who calls?&rdquo; And a tall
      figure seemed to rise, as from the grave itself, and emerge from the
      shadow of the church. A moment more, and a strong gripe was laid on the
      shoulder of the ravisher. &ldquo;What is this? On God&rsquo;s ground, too! Release
      her, wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man, trembling, half with superstitious, half with bodily fear, let go
      his captive, who fell at once at the knees of her deliverer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      hurt me too,&rdquo; she said, as the tears rolled down her eyes. &ldquo;I am a good
      girl&mdash;and my grandfather&rsquo;s blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger bent down and raised her; then looking round for the
      assailant with an eye whose dark fire shone through the gloom, he
      perceived the coward stealing off. He disdained to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; said he, with that voice which the strong assume to the
      weak&mdash;the man to some wounded infant&mdash;the voice of tender
      superiority and compassion, &ldquo;there is no cause for fear now. Be soothed.
      Do you live near? Shall I see you home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you! That&rsquo;s kind. Pray do!&rdquo; And, with an infantine confidence she
      took his hand, as a child does that of a grown-up person;&mdash;so they
      walked on together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;do you know that man? Has he insulted you
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk of him: ce me fait mal!&rdquo; And she put her hand to her
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French was spoken with so French an accent, that, in some curiosity,
      the stranger cast his eye over her plain dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak French well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? I wish I knew more words&mdash;I only recollect a few. When I am
      very happy or very sad they come into my head. But I am happy now. I like
      your voice&mdash;I like you&mdash;Oh! I have dropped my basket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go back for it, or shall I buy you another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another!&mdash;Oh, no! come back for it. How kind you are!&mdash;Ah! I
      see it!&rdquo; and she broke away and ran forward to pick it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had recovered it, she laughed&mdash;she spoke to it&mdash;she
      kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion smiled as he said: &ldquo;Some sweetheart has given you that
      basket&mdash;it seems but a common basket too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had it&mdash;oh, ever since&mdash;since&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how
      long! It came with me from France&mdash;it was full of little toys. They
      are gone&mdash;I am so sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pretty one,&rdquo; said the stranger, with deep pity in his rich voice,
      &ldquo;your mother should not let you go out alone at this hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&mdash;mother!&rdquo; repeated the girl, in a tone of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I had a father once. But he died, they say. I did not see him die. I
      sometimes cry when I think that I shall never, never see him again! But,&rdquo;
       she said, changing her accent from melancholy almost to joy, &ldquo;he is to
      have a grave here like the other girl&rsquo;s fathers&mdash;a fine stone upon it&mdash;and
      all to be done with my money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your money, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the money I make. I sell my work and take the money to my
      grandfather; but I lay by a little every week for a gravestone for my
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will the gravestone be placed in that churchyard?&rdquo; They were now in
      another lane; and, as he spoke, the stranger checked her, and bending down
      to look into her face, he murmured to himself, &ldquo;Is it possible?&mdash;it
      must be&mdash;it must!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I love that churchyard&mdash;my brother told me to put flowers
      there; and grandfather and I sit there in the summer, without speaking.
      But I don&rsquo;t talk much, I like singing better:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;&lsquo;All things that good and harmless are
        Are taught, they say, to sing
        The maiden resting at her work,
        The bird upon the wing;
        The little ones at church, in prayer;
        The angels in the sky
        The angels less when babes are born
        Than when the aged die.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And unconscious of the latent moral, dark or cheering, according as we
      estimate the value of this life, couched in the concluding rhyme, Fanny
      turned round to the stranger, and said, &ldquo;Why should the angels be glad
      when the aged die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That they are released from a false, unjust, and miserable world, in
      which the first man was a rebel, and the second a murderer!&rdquo; muttered the
      stranger between his teeth, which he gnashed as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not understand him: she shook her head gently, and made no
      reply. A few moments, and she paused before a small house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said her companion, examining the exterior of the house with
      an earnest gaze; &ldquo;and your name is Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;every one knows Fanny. Come in;&rdquo; and the girl opened the door
      with a latch-key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger bowed his stately height as he crossed the low threshold and
      followed his guide into a little parlour. Before a table on which burned
      dimly, and with unheeded wick, a single candle, sat a man of advanced age;
      and as he turned his face to the door, the stranger saw that he was blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl bounded to his chair, passed her arms round the old man&rsquo;s neck,
      and kissed his forehead; then nestling herself at his feet, and leaning
      her clasped hands caressingly on his knee, she said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpapa, I have brought you somebody you must love. He has been so kind
      to Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And neither of you can remember me!&rdquo; said the guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, whose dull face seemed to indicate dotage, half raised
      himself at the sound of the stranger&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said he, with
      a feeble and querulous voice. &ldquo;Who wants me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the friend of your lost son. I am he who, ten years go, brought
      Fanny to your roof, and gave her to your care&mdash;your son&rsquo;s last
      charge. And you blessed your son, and forgave him, and vowed to be a
      father to his Fanny.&rdquo; The old man, who had now slowly risen to his feet,
      trembled violently, and stretched out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come near&mdash;near&mdash;let me put my hands on your head. I cannot see
      you; but Fanny talks of you, and prays for you; and Fanny&mdash;she has
      been an angel to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger approached and half knelt as the old man spread his hands
      over his head, muttering inaudibly. Meanwhile Fanny, pale as death&mdash;her
      lips apart&mdash;an eager, painful expression on her face&mdash;looked
      inquiringly on the dark, marked countenance of the visitor, and creeping
      towards him inch by inch, fearfully touched his dress&mdash;his arms&mdash;his
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; she said at last, doubtingly and timidly, &ldquo;Brother, I thought I
      could never forget you! But you are not like my brother; you are older;&mdash;you
      are&mdash;you are!&mdash;no! no! you are not my brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much changed, Fanny; and you too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled as he spoke; and the smile&mdash;sweet and pitying&mdash;thoroughly
      changed the character of his face, which was ordinarily stern, grave, and
      proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you now!&rdquo; exclaimed Fanny, in a tone of wild joy. &ldquo;And you come
      back from that grave! My flowers have brought you back at last! I knew
      they would! Brother! Brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she threw herself on his breast and burst into passionate tears. Then,
      suddenly drawing herself back, she laid her finger on his arm, and looked
      up at him beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, now, is he really dead? He, my father!&mdash;he, too, was lost like
      you. Can&rsquo;t he come back again as you have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you grieve for him still, then? Poor girl!&rdquo; said the stranger,
      evasively, and seating himself. Fanny continued to listen for an answer to
      her touching question; but finding that none was given, she stole away to
      a corner of the room, and leaned her face on her hands, and seemed to
      think&mdash;till at last, as she so sat, the tears began to flow down her
      cheeks, and she wept, but silently and unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said the guest, after a short pause, &ldquo;how is this? Fanny tells
      me she supports you by her work. Are you so poor, then? Yet I left you
      your son&rsquo;s bequest; and you, too, I understood, though not rich, were not
      in want!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a curse on my gold,&rdquo; said the old man, sternly. &ldquo;It was stolen
      from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause. Simon broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, young man&mdash;how has it fared with you? You have prospered, I
      hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as I have been for years&mdash;alone in the world, without kindred
      and without friends. But, thanks to Heaven, I am not a beggar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No kindred and no friends!&rdquo; repeated the old man. &ldquo;No father&mdash;no
      brother&mdash;no wife&mdash;no sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None! No one to care whether I live or die,&rdquo; answered the stranger, with
      a mixture of pride and sadness in his voice. &ldquo;But, as the song has it&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;&lsquo;I care for nobody&mdash;no, not I,
          For nobody cares for me!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There was a certain pathos in the mockery with which he repeated the
      homely lines, although, as he did, he gathered himself up, as if conscious
      of a certain consolation and reliance on the resources not dependent on
      others which he had found in his own strong limbs and his own stout heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he felt a soft touch upon his hand, and he saw Fanny
      looking at him through the tears that still flowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no one to care for you? Don&rsquo;t say so! Come and live with us,
      brother; we&rsquo;ll care for you. I have never forgotten the flowers&mdash;never!
      Do come! Fanny shall love you. Fanny can work for three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they call her an idiot!&rdquo; mumbled the old man, with a vacant smile on
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister! You shall be my sister! Forlorn one&mdash;whom even Nature has
      fooled and betrayed! Sister!&mdash;we, both orphans! Sister!&rdquo; exclaimed
      that dark, stern man, passionately, and with a broken voice; and he opened
      his arms, and Fanny, without a blush or a thought of shame, threw herself
      on his breast. He kissed her forehead with a kiss that was, indeed, pure
      and holy as a brother&rsquo;s: and Fanny felt that he had left upon her cheek a
      tear that was not her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with an altered voice, and taking the old man&rsquo;s hand,
      &ldquo;what say you? Shall I take up my lodging with you? I have a little money;
      I can protect and aid you both. I shall be often away&mdash;in London or
      else where&mdash;and will not intrude too much on you. But you blind, and
      she&mdash;(here he broke off the sentence abruptly and went on)&mdash;you
      should not be left alone. And this neighbourhood, that burial-place, are
      dear to me. I, too, Fanny, have lost a parent; and that grave&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and then added, in a trembling voice, &ldquo;And you have placed
      flowers over that grave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay with us,&rdquo; said the blind man; &ldquo;not for our sake, but your own. The
      world is a bad place. I have been long sick of the world. Yes! come and
      live near the burial-ground&mdash;the nearer you are to the grave, the
      safer you are;&mdash;and you have a little money, you say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come to-morrow, then. I must return now. Tomorrow, Fanny, we shall
      meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you go?&rdquo; said Fanny, tenderly. &ldquo;But you will come again; you know I
      used to think every one died when he left me. I am wiser now. Yet still,
      when you do leave me, it is true that you die for Fanny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, as the three persons were grouped, each had assumed a
      posture of form, an expression of face, which a painter of fitting
      sentiment and skill would have loved to study. The visitor had gained the
      door; and as he stood there, his noble height&mdash;the magnificent
      strength and health of his manhood in its full prime&mdash;contrasted
      alike the almost spectral debility of extreme age and the graceful
      delicacy of Fanny&mdash;half girl, half child. There was something foreign
      in his air&mdash;and the half military habit, relieved by the red riband
      of the Bourbon knighthood. His complexion was dark as that of a Moor, and
      his raven hair curled close to the stately head. The soldier-moustache&mdash;thick,
      but glossy as silk-shaded the firm lip; and the pointed beard, assumed by
      the exiled Carlists, heightened the effect of the strong and haughty
      features and the expression of the martial countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Fanny&rsquo;s voice died on his ear, he half averted that proud face; and
      the dark eyes&mdash;almost Oriental in their brilliancy and depth of shade&mdash;seemed
      soft and humid. And there stood Fanny, in a posture of such unconscious
      sadness&mdash;such childlike innocence; her arms drooping&mdash;her face
      wistfully turned to his&mdash;and a half smile upon the lips, that made
      still more touching the tears not yet dried upon her cheeks. While thin,
      frail, shadowy, with white hair and furrowed cheeks, the old man fixed his
      sightless orbs on space; and his face, usually only animated from the
      lethargy of advancing dotage by a certain querulous cynicism, now grew
      suddenly earnest, and even thoughtful, as Fanny spoke of Death!

      I have not sought&mdash;as would have been easy, by a little ingenuity in
      the earlier portion of this narrative&mdash;whatever source of vulgar
      interest might be derived from the mystery of names and persons. As in
      Charles Spencer the reader is allowed at a glance to detect Sidney Morton,
      so in Philip de Vaudemont (the stranger who rescued Fanny) the reader at
      once recognises the hero of my tale; but since neither of these young men
      has a better right to the name resigned than to the name adopted, it will
      be simpler and more convenient to designate them by those appellations by
      which they are now known to the world. In truth, Philip de Vaudemont was
      scarcely the same being as Philip Morton. In the short visit he had paid
      to the elder Gawtrey, when he consigned Fanny to his charge, he had given
      no name; and the one he now took (when, towards the evening of the next
      day he returned to Simon&rsquo;s house) the old man heard for the first time.
      Once more sunk into his usual apathy, Simon did not express any surprise
      that a Frenchman should be so well acquainted with English&mdash;he
      scarcely observed that the name was French. Simon&rsquo;s age seemed daily to
      bring him more and more to that state when life is mere mechanism, and the
      soul, preparing for its departure, no longer heeds the tenement that
      crumbles silently and neglected into its lonely dust. Vaudemont came with
      but little luggage (for he had an apartment also in London), and no
      attendant,&mdash;a single horse was consigned to the stables of an inn at
      hand, and he seemed, as soldiers are, more careful for the comforts of the
      animal than his own. There was but one woman servant in the humble
      household, who did all the ruder work, for Fanny&rsquo;s industry could afford
      it. The solitary servant and the homely fare sufficed for the simple and
      hardy adventurer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, with a countenance radiant with joy, took his hand and led him to
      his room. Poor child! with that instinct of woman which never deserted
      her, she had busied herself the whole day in striving to deck the chamber
      according to her own notions of comfort. She had stolen from her little
      hoard wherewithal to make some small purchases, on which the Dowbiggin of
      the suburb had been consulted. And what with flowers on the table, and a
      fire at the hearth, the room looked cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him as he glanced around, and felt disappointed that he did
      not utter the admiration she expected. Angry at last with the indifference
      which, in fact, as to external accommodation, was habitual to him, she
      plucked his sleeve, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak? Is it not nice?&mdash;Fanny did her best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a thousand thanks to Fanny! It is all I could wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another room, bigger than this, but the wicked woman who robbed
      us slept there; and besides, you said you liked the churchyard. See!&rdquo; and
      she opened the window and pointed to the church-tower rising dark against
      the evening sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is better than all!&rdquo; said Vaudemont; and he looked out from the
      window in a silent reverie, which Fanny did not disturb.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he was settled! From a career so wild, agitated, and various, the
      adventurer paused in that humble resting-nook. But quiet is not repose&mdash;obscurity
      is not content. Often as, morn and eve, he looked forth upon the spot,
      where his mother&rsquo;s heart, unconscious of love and woe, mouldered away, the
      indignant and bitter feelings of the wronged outcast and the son who could
      not clear the mother&rsquo;s name swept away the subdued and gentle melancholy
      into which time usually softens regret for the dead, and with which most
      of us think of the distant past, and the once joyous childhood!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this man&rsquo;s breast lay, concealed by his external calm, those memories
      and aspirations which are as strong as passions. In his earlier years,
      when he had been put to hard shifts for existence, he had found no leisure
      for close and brooding reflection upon that spoliation of just rights&mdash;that
      calumny upon his mother&rsquo;s name, which had first brought the Night into his
      Morning. His resentment towards the Beauforts, it is true, had ever been
      an intense but a fitful and irregular passion. It was exactly in
      proportion as, by those rare and romantic incidents which Fiction cannot
      invent, and which Narrative takes with diffidence from the great
      Store-house of Real Life, his steps had ascended in the social ladder&mdash;that
      all which his childhood had lost&mdash;all which the robbers of his
      heritage had gained, the grandeur and the power of WEALTH&mdash;above all,
      the hourly and the tranquil happiness of a stainless name, became palpable
      and distinct. He had loved Eugenie as a boy loves for the first time an
      accomplished woman. He regarded her, so refined&mdash;so gentle&mdash;so
      gifted, with the feelings due to a superior being, with an eternal
      recollection of the ministering angel that had shone upon him when he
      stood on the dark abyss. She was the first that had redeemed his fate&mdash;the
      first that had guided aright his path&mdash;the first that had tamed the
      savage at his breast:&mdash;it was the young lion charmed by the eyes of
      Una. The outline of his story had been truly given at Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s.
      Despite his pride, which revolted from such obligations to another, and a
      woman&mdash;which disliked and struggled against a disguise which at once
      and alone saved him from the detection of the past and the terrors of the
      future&mdash;he had yielded to her, the wise and the gentle, as one whose
      judgment he could not doubt; and, indeed, the slanderous falsehoods
      circulated by the lackey, to whose discretion, the night of Gawtrey&rsquo;s
      death, Eugenie had preferred to confide her own honour, rather than
      another&rsquo;s life, had (as Liancourt rightly stated) left Philip no option
      but that which Madame de Merville deemed the best, whether for her
      happiness or her good name. Then had followed a brief season&mdash;the
      holiday of his life&mdash;the season of young hope and passion, of
      brilliancy and joy, closing by that abrupt death which again left him
      lonely in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, from the grief that succeeded to the death of Eugenie, he woke to
      find himself amidst the strange faces and exciting scenes of an Oriental
      court, he turned with hard and disgustful contempt from Pleasure, as an
      infidelity to the dead. Ambition crept over him&mdash;his mind hardened as
      his cheek bronzed under those burning suns&mdash;his hardy frame, his
      energies prematurely awakened, his constitutional disregard to danger,&mdash;made
      him a brave and skilful soldier. He acquired reputation and rank. But, as
      time went on, the ambition took a higher flight&mdash;he felt his sphere
      circumscribed; the Eastern indolence that filled up the long intervals
      between Eastern action chafed a temper never at rest: he returned to
      France: his reputation, Liancourt&rsquo;s friendship, and the relations of
      Eugenie&mdash;grateful, as has before been implied, for the generosity
      with which he surrendered the principal part of her donation&mdash;opened
      for him a new career, but one painful and galling. In the Indian court
      there was no question of his birth&mdash;one adventurer was equal with the
      rest. But in Paris, a man attempting to rise provoked all the sarcasm of
      wit, all the cavils of party; and in polished and civil life, what valour
      has weapons against a jest? Thus, in civilisation, all the passions that
      spring from humiliated self-love and baffled aspiration again preyed upon
      his breast. He saw, then, that the more he struggled from obscurity, the
      more acute would become research into his true origin; and his writhing
      pride almost stung to death his ambition. To succeed in life by regular
      means was indeed difficult for this man; always recoiling from the name he
      bore&mdash;always strong in the hope yet to regain that to which he
      conceived himself entitled&mdash;cherishing that pride of country which
      never deserts the native of a Free State, however harsh a parent she may
      have proved; and, above all, whatever his ambition and his passions,
      taking, from the very misfortunes he had known, an indomitable belief in
      the ultimate justice of Heaven;&mdash;he had refused to sever the last
      ties that connected him with his lost heritage and his forsaken land&mdash;he
      refused to be naturalised&mdash;to make the name he bore legally
      undisputed&mdash;he was contented to be an alien. Neither was Vaudemont
      fitted exactly for that crisis in the social world when the men of
      journals and talk bustle aside the men of action. He had not cultivated
      literature, he had no book-knowledge&mdash;the world had been his school,
      and stern life his teacher. Still, eminently skilled in those physical
      accomplishments which men admire and soldiers covet, calm and
      self-possessed in manner, of great personal advantages, of much ready
      talent and of practised observation in character, he continued to breast
      the obstacles around him, and to establish himself in the favour of those
      in power. It was natural to a person so reared and circumstanced to have
      no sympathy with what is called the popular cause. He was no citizen in
      the state&mdash;he was a stranger in the land. He had suffered and still
      suffered too much from mankind to have that philanthropy, sometimes
      visionary but always noble, which, in fact, generally springs from the
      studies we cultivate, not in the forum, but the closet. Men, alas! too
      often lose the Democratic Enthusiasm in proportion as they find reason to
      suspect or despise their kind. And if there were not hopes for the Future,
      which this hard, practical daily life does not suffice to teach us, the
      vision and the glory that belong to the Great Popular Creed, dimmed
      beneath the injustice, the follies, and the vices of the world as it is,
      would fade into the lukewarm sectarianism of temporary Party. Moreover,
      Vaudemont&rsquo;s habits of thought and reasoning were those of the camp,
      confirmed by the systems familiar to him in the East: he regarded the
      populace as a soldier enamoured of discipline and order usually does. His
      theories, therefore, or rather his ignorance of what is sound in theory,
      went with Charles the Tenth in his excesses, but not with the timidity
      which terminated those excesses by dethronement and disgrace. Chafed to
      the heart, gnawed with proud grief, he obeyed the royal mandates, and
      followed the exiled monarch: his hopes overthrown, his career in France
      annihilated forever. But on entering England, his temper, confident and
      ready of resource, fastened itself on new food. In the land where he had
      no name he might yet rebuild his fortunes. It was an arduous effort&mdash;an
      improbable hope; but the words heard by the bridge of Paris&mdash;words
      that had often cheered him in his exile through hardships and through
      dangers which it is unnecessary to our narrative to detail&mdash;yet rung
      again in his ear, as he leaped on his native land,&mdash;&ldquo;Time, Faith,
      Energy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While such his character in the larger and more distant relations of life,
      in the closer circles of companionship many rare and noble qualities were
      visible. It is true that he was stern, perhaps imperious&mdash;of a temper
      that always struggled for command; but he was deeply susceptible of
      kindness, and, if feared by those who opposed, loved by those who served
      him. About his character was that mixture of tenderness and fierceness
      which belonged, of old, to the descriptions of the warrior. Though so
      little unlettered, Life had taught him a certain poetry of sentiment and
      idea&mdash;More poetry, perhaps, in the silent thoughts that, in his
      happier moments, filled his solitude, than in half the pages that his
      brother had read and written by the dreaming lake. A certain largeness of
      idea and nobility of impulse often made him act the sentiments of which
      bookmen write. With all his passions, he held licentiousness in disdain;
      with all his ambition for the power of wealth, he despised its luxury.
      Simple, masculine, severe, abstemious, he was of that mould in which, in
      earlier times, the successful men of action have been cast. But to
      successful action, circumstance is more necessary than to triumphant
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to be expected that, in proportion as he had been familiar with a
      purer and nobler life, he should look with great and deep self-humiliation
      at his early association with Gawtrey. He was in this respect more severe
      on himself than any other mind ordinarily just and candid would have been,&mdash;when
      fairly surveying the circumstances of penury, hunger, and despair, which
      had driven him to Gawtrey&rsquo;s roof, the imperfect nature of his early
      education, the boyish trust and affection he had felt for his protector,
      and his own ignorance of, and exemption from, all the worst practices of
      that unhappy criminal. But still, when, with the knowledge he had now
      acquired, the man looked calmly back, his cheek burned with remorseful
      shame at his unreflecting companionship in a life of subterfuge and
      equivocation, the true nature of which, the boy (so circumstanced as we
      have shown him) might be forgiven for not at that time comprehending. Two
      advantages resulted, however, from the error and the remorse: first, the
      humiliation it brought curbed, in some measure, a pride that might
      otherwise have been arrogant and unamiable, and, secondly, as I have
      before intimated, his profound gratitude to Heaven for his deliverance
      from the snares that had beset his youth gave his future the guide of an
      earnest and heartfelt faith. He acknowledged in life no such thing as
      accident. Whatever his struggles, whatever his melancholy, whatever his
      sense of worldly wrong, he never despaired; for nothing now could shake
      his belief in one directing Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ways and habits of Vaudemont were not at discord with those of the
      quiet household in which he was now a guest. Like most men of strong
      frames, and accustomed to active, not studious pursuits, he rose early;&mdash;and
      usually rode to London, to come back late at noon to their frugal meal.
      And if again, perhaps after the hour when Fanny and Simon retired, he
      would often return to London, his own pass-key re-admitted him, at
      whatever time he came back, without disturbing the sleep of the household.
      Sometimes, when the sun began to decline, if the air was warm, the old man
      would crawl out, leaning on that strong arm, through the neighbouring
      lanes, ever returning through the lonely burial-ground; or when the blind
      host clung to his fireside, and composed himself to sleep, Philip would
      saunter forth along with Fanny; and on the days when she went to sell her
      work, or select her purchases, he always made a point of attending her.
      And her cheek wore a flush of pride when she saw him carrying her little
      basket, or waiting without, in musing patience, while she performed her
      commissions in the shops. Though in reality Fanny&rsquo;s intellect was ripening
      within, yet still the surface often misled the eye as to the depths. It
      was rather that something yet held back the faculties from their growth
      than that the faculties themselves were wanting. Her weakness was more of
      the nature of the infant&rsquo;s than of one afflicted with incurable
      imbecility. For instance, she managed the little household with skill and
      prudence; she could calculate in her head, as rapidly as Vaudemont
      himself, the arithmetic necessary to her simple duties; she knew the value
      of money, which is more than some of us wise folk do. Her skill, even in
      her infancy so remarkable, in various branches of female handiwork, was
      carried, not only by perseverance, but by invention and peculiar talent,
      to a marvellous and exquisite perfection. Her embroidery, especially in
      what was then more rare than at present, viz., flowers on silk, was much
      in request among the great modistes of London, to whom it found its way
      through the agency of Miss Semper. So that all this had enabled her, for
      years, to provide every necessary comfort of life for herself and her
      blind protector. And her care for the old man was beautiful in its
      minuteness, its vigilance. Wherever her heart was interested, there never
      seemed a deficiency of mind. Vaudemont was touched to see how much of
      affectionate and pitying respect she appeared to enjoy in the
      neighbourhood, especially among the humbler classes&mdash;even the beggar
      who swept the crossings did not beg of her, but bade God bless her as she
      passed; and the rude, discontented artisan would draw himself from the
      wall and answer, with a softened brow, the smile with which the harmless
      one charmed his courtesy. In fact, whatever attraction she took from her
      youth, her beauty, her misfortune, and her affecting industry, was
      heightened, in the eyes of the poorer neighbours, by many little traits of
      charity and kindness; many a sick child had she tended, and many a
      breadless board had stolen something from the stock set aside for her
      father&rsquo;s grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; she once whispered to Vaudemont, &ldquo;that God attends to
      us more if we are good to those who are sick and hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly we are taught to think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell again. Grandpapa once said
      that my father had done bad things; now, if Fanny is good to those she can
      help, I think that God will hear her more kindly when she prays him to
      forgive what her father did. Do you think so too? Do say&mdash;you are so
      wise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny, you are wiser than all of us; and I feel myself better and happier
      when I hear you speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were, indeed, many moments when Vaudemont thought that her
      deficiencies of intellect might have been repaired, long since, by skilful
      culture and habitual companionship with those of her own age; from which
      companionship, however, Fanny, even when at school, had shrunk aloof. At
      other moments there was something so absent and distracted about her, or
      so fantastic and incoherent, that Vaudemont, with the man&rsquo;s hard, worldly
      eye, read in it nothing but melancholy confusion. Nevertheless, if the
      skein of ideas was entangled, each thread in itself was a thread of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny&rsquo;s great object&mdash;her great ambition&mdash;her one hope&mdash;was
      a tomb for her supposed father. Whether from some of that early religion
      attached to the grave, which is most felt in Catholic countries, and which
      she had imbibed at the convent; or from her residence so near the burial
      ground, and the affection with which she regarded the spot;&mdash;whatever
      the cause, she had cherished for some years, as young maidens usually
      cherish the desire of the Altar&mdash;the dream of the Gravestone. But the
      hoard was amassed so slowly;&mdash;now old Gawtrey was attacked by
      illness;&mdash;now there was some little difficulty in the rent; now some
      fluctuation in the price of work; and now, and more often than all, some
      demand on her charity, which interfered with, and drew from, the pious
      savings. This was a sentiment in which her new friend sympathised deeply;
      for he, too, remembered that his first gold had bought that humble stone
      which still preserved upon the earth the memory of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, days crept on, and no new violence was offered to Fanny.
      Vaudemont learned, then, by little and little&mdash;and Fanny&rsquo;s account
      was very confused&mdash;the nature of the danger she had run.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that one day, tempted by the fineness of the weather up the road
      that led from the suburb farther into the country, Fanny was stopped by a
      gentleman in a carriage, who accosted her, as she said, very kindly: and
      after several questions, which she answered with her usual unsuspecting
      innocence, learned her trade, insisted on purchasing some articles of work
      which she had at the moment in her basket, and promised to procure her a
      constant purchaser, upon much better terms than she had hitherto obtained,
      if she would call at the house of a Mrs. West, about a mile from the
      suburb towards London. This she promised to do, and this she did,
      according to the address he gave her. She was admitted to a lady more
      gaily dressed than Fanny had ever seen a lady before,&mdash;the gentleman
      was also present,&mdash;they both loaded her with compliments, and bought
      her work at a price which seemed about to realise all the hopes of the
      poor girl as to the gravestone for William Gawtrey,&mdash;as if his evil
      fate pursued that wild man beyond the grave, and his very tomb was to be
      purchased by the gold of the polluter! The lady then appointed her to call
      again; but, meanwhile, she met Fanny in the streets, and while she was
      accosting her, it fortunately chanced that Miss Semper the milliner passed
      that way&mdash;turned round, looked hard at the lady, used very angry
      language to her, seized Fanny&rsquo;s hand, led her away while the lady slunk
      off; and told her that the said lady was a very bad woman, and that Fanny
      must never speak to her again. Fanny most cheerfully promised this. And,
      in fact, the lady, probably afraid, whether of the mob or the magistrates,
      never again came near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Fanny, &ldquo;I gave the money they had both given to me to Miss
      Semper, who said she would send it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did right, Fanny; and as you made one promise to Miss Semper, so you
      must make me one&mdash;never to stir from home again without me or some
      other person. No, no other person&mdash;only me. I will give up everything
      else to go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you? Oh, yes. I promise! I used to like going alone, but that was
      before you came, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Fanny kept her promise, it would have been a bold gallant indeed
      who would have ventured to molest her by the side of that stately and
      strong protector.

      On the day and at the hour fixed for the interview with the stranger who
      had visited Mr. Beaufort, Lord Lilburne was seated in the library of his
      brother-in-law; and before the elbow-chair, on which he lolled carelessly,
      stood our old friend Mr. Sharp, of Bow Street notability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sharp,&rdquo; said the peer, &ldquo;I have sent for you to do me a little favour.
      I expect a man here who professes to give Mr. Beaufort, my brother-in-law,
      some information about a lawsuit. It is necessary to know the exact value
      of his evidence. I wish you to ascertain all particulars about him. Be so
      good as to seat yourself in the porter&rsquo;s chair in the hall; note him when
      he enters, unobserved yourself&mdash;but as he is probably a stranger to
      you, note him still more when he leaves the house; follow him at a

      visits, their names and directions, what his character and calling are;&mdash;in
      a word, everything you can, and report to me each evening. Dog him well,
      never lose sight of him&mdash;you will be handsomely paid. You
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Sharp, &ldquo;leave me alone, my lord. Been employed before by
      your lordship&rsquo;s brother-in-law. We knows what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it. To your post&mdash;I expect him every moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in fact, Mr. Sharp had only just ensconced himself in the porter&rsquo;s
      chair when the stranger knocked at the door&mdash;in another moment he was
      shown in to Lord Lilburne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said his lordship, without rising, &ldquo;be so good as to take a chair.
      Mr. Beaufort is obliged to leave town&mdash;he has asked me to see you&mdash;I
      am one of his family&mdash;his wife is my sister&mdash;you may be as frank
      with me as with him,&mdash;more so, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg the fauvour of your name, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, adjusting his
      collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours first&mdash;business is business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Captain Smith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what regiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Lord Lilburne. Your name is Smith&mdash;humph!&rdquo; added the peer,
      looking over some notes before him. &ldquo;I see it is also the name of the
      witness appealed to by Mrs. Morton&mdash;humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this remark, and still more at the look which accompanied it, the
      countenance, before impudent and complacent, of Captain Smith fell into
      visible embarrassment; he cleared his throat and said, with a little
      hesitation,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, that witness is living!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of it&mdash;witnesses never die where property is concerned and
      imposture intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the servant entered, and placed a little note, quaintly
      folded, before Lord Lilburne. He glanced at it in surprise&mdash;opened,
      and read as follows, in pencil,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My LORD,&mdash;I knows the man; take caer of him; he is as big a roge as
      ever stept; he was transported some three year back, and unless his time
      has been shortened by the Home, he&rsquo;s absent without leve. We used to call
      him Dashing Jerry. That ere youngster we went arter, by Mr. Bofort&rsquo;s wish,
      was a pall of his. Scuze the liberty I take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J. SHARP.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Lord Lilburne held this effusion to the candle, and spelled his way
      through it, Captain Smith, recovering his self-composure, thus proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imposture, my lord! imposture! I really don&rsquo;t understand. Your lordship
      really seems so suspicious, that it is quite uncomfortable. I am sure it
      is all the same to me; and if Mr. Beaufort does not think proper to see me
      himself, why I&rsquo;d best make my bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Captain Smith rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay a moment, sir. What Mr. Beaufort may yet do, I cannot say; but I
      know this, you stand charged of a very grave offence, and if your witness
      or witnesses&mdash;you may have fifty, for what I care&mdash;are equally
      guilty, so much the worse for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord, I really don&rsquo;t comprehend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will be more plain. I accuse you of devising an infamous falsehood
      for the purpose of extorting money. Let your witnesses appear in court,
      and I promise that you, they, and the young man, Mr. Morton, whose claim
      they set up, shall be indicted for conspiracy&mdash;conspiracy, if
      accompanied (as in the case of your witnesses) with perjury, of the
      blackest die. Mr. Smith, I know you; and, before ten o&rsquo;clock to-morrow, I
      shall know also if you had his majesty&rsquo;s leave to quit the colonies! Ah! I
      am plain enough now, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lord Lilburne threw himself back in his chair, and coldly contemplated
      the white face and dismayed expression of the crestfallen captain. That
      most worthy person, after a pause of confusion, amaze, and fear, made an
      involuntary stride, with a menacing gesture, towards Lilburne; the peer
      quietly placed his hand on the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment more,&rdquo; said the latter; &ldquo;if I ring this bell, it is to place
      you in custody. Let Mr. Beaufort but see you here once again&mdash;nay,
      let him but hear another word of this pretended lawsuit&mdash;and you
      return to the colonies. Pshaw! Frown not at me, sir! A Bow Street officer
      is in the hall. Begone!&mdash;no, stop one moment, and take a lesson in
      life. Never again attempt to threaten people of property and station.
      Around every rich man is a wall&mdash;better not run your head against
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I swear solemnly,&rdquo; cried the knave, with an emphasis so startling
      that it carried with it the appearance of truth, &ldquo;that the marriage did
      take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say, no less solemnly, that any one who swears it in a court of law
      shall be prosecuted for perjury! Bah! you are a sorry rogue, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with an air of supreme and half-compassionate contempt, Lord Lilburne
      turned away and stirred the fire. Captain Smith muttered and fumbled a
      moment with his gloves, then shrugged his shoulders and sneaked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Lord Lilburne again received his friends, and amongst his
      guests came Vaudemont. Lilburne was one who liked the study of character,
      especially the character of men wrestling against the world. Wholly free
      from every species of ambition, he seemed to reconcile himself to his
      apathy by examining into the disquietude, the mortification, the heart&rsquo;s
      wear and tear, which are the lot of the ambitious. Like the spider in his
      hole, he watched with hungry pleasure the flies struggling in the web;
      through whose slimy labyrinth he walked with an easy safety. Perhaps one
      reason why he loved gaming was less from the joy of winning than the
      philosophical complacency with which he feasted on the emotions of those
      who lost; always serene, and, except in debauch, always passionless,&mdash;Majendie,
      tracing the experiments of science in the agonies of some tortured dog,
      could not be more rapt in the science, and more indifferent to the dog,
      than Lord Lilburne, ruining a victim, in the analysis of human passions,&mdash;stoical
      in the writhings of the wretch whom he tranquilly dissected. He wished to
      win money of Vaudemont&mdash;to ruin this man, who presumed to be more
      generous than other people&mdash;to see a bold adventurer submitted to the
      wheel of the Fortune which reigns in a pack of cards;&mdash;and all, of
      course, without the least hate to the man whom he then saw for the first
      time. On the contrary, he felt a respect for Vaudemont. Like most worldly
      men, Lord Lilburne was prepossessed in favour of those who seek to rise in
      life: and like men who have excelled in manly and athletic exercises, he
      was also prepossessed in favour of those who appeared fitted for the same
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liancourt took aside his friend, as Lord Lilburne was talking with his
      other guests:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need not caution you, who never play, not to commit yourself to Lord
      Lilburne&rsquo;s tender mercies; remember, he is an admirable player.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Vaudemont, &ldquo;I want to know this man: I have reasons, which
      alone induce me to enter his house. I can afford to venture something,
      because I wish to see if I can gain something for one dear to me. And for
      the rest (he muttered)&mdash;I know him too well not to be on my guard.&rdquo;
       With that he joined Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s group, and accepted the invitation to
      the card-table. At supper, Vaudemont conversed more than was habitual to
      him; he especially addressed himself to his host, and listened, with great
      attention, to Lilburne&rsquo;s caustic comments upon every topic successively
      started. And whether it was the art of De Vaudemont, or from an interest
      that Lord Lilburne took in studying what was to him a new character,&mdash;or
      whether that, both men excelling peculiarly in all masculine
      accomplishments, their conversation was of a nature that was more
      attractive to themselves than to others; it so happened that they were
      still talking while the daylight already peered through the
      window-curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have outstayed all your guests,&rdquo; said De Vaudemont, glancing round
      the emptied room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the best compliment you could pay me. Another night we can enliven
      our tete-a-tete with ecarte; though at your age, and with your appearance,
      I am surprised, Monsieur de Vaudemont, that you are fond of play: I should
      have thought that it was not in a pack of cards that you looked for
      hearts. But perhaps you are <i>blase </i>betimes of the <i>beau sexe</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet your lordship&rsquo;s devotion to it is, perhaps, as great now as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine?&mdash;no, not as ever. To different ages different degrees. At your
      age I wooed; at mine I purchase&mdash;the better plan of the two: it does
      not take up half so much time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your marriage, I think, Lord Lilburne, was not blessed with children.
      Perhaps sometimes you feel the want of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did, I could have them by the dozen. Other ladies have been more
      generous in that department than the late Lady Lilburne, Heaven rest her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Vaudemont, fixing his eyes with some earnestness on his host,
      &ldquo;if you were really persuaded that you had a child, or perhaps a
      grandchild&mdash;the mother one whom you loved in your first youth&mdash;a
      child affectionate, beautiful, and especially needing your care and
      protection, would you not suffer that child, though illegitimate, to
      supply to you the want of filial affection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Filial affection, mon cher!&rdquo; repeated Lord Lilburne, &ldquo;needing my care and
      protection! Pshaw! In other words, would I give board and lodging to some
      young vagabond who was good enough to say he was son to Lord Lilburne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you were convinced that the claimant were your son, or perhaps
      your daughter&mdash;a tenderer name of the two, and a more helpless
      claimant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Monsieur de Vaudemont, you are doubtless a man of gallantry and
      of the world. If the children whom the law forces on one are, nine times
      out of ten, such damnable plagues, judge if one would father those whom
      the law permits us to disown! Natural children are the pariahs of the
      world, and I&mdash;am one of the Brahmans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; persisted Vaudemont, &ldquo;forgive me if I press the question farther.
      Perhaps I seek from your wisdom a guide to my own conduct;&mdash;suppose,
      then, a man had loved, had wronged, the mother;&mdash;suppose that in the
      child he saw one who, without his aid, might be exposed to every curse
      with which the pariahs (true, the pariahs!) of the world are too often
      visited, and who with his aid might become, as age advanced, his
      companion, his nurse, his comforter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; interrupted Lilburne, with some impatience; &ldquo;I know not how our
      conversation fell on such a topic&mdash;but if you really ask my opinion
      in reference to any case in practical life, you shall have it. Look you,
      then Monsieur de Vaudemont, no man has studied the art of happiness more
      than I have; and I will tell you the great secret&mdash;have as few ties
      as possible. Nurse!&mdash;pooh! you or I could hire one by the week a
      thousand times more useful and careful than a bore of a child. Comforter!&mdash;a
      man of mind never wants comfort. And there is no such thing as sorrow
      while we have health and money, and don&rsquo;t care a straw for anybody in the
      world. If you choose to love people, their health and circumstances, if
      either go wrong, can fret you: that opens many avenues to pain. Never live
      alone, but always feel alone. You think this unamiable: possibly. I am no
      hypocrite, and, for my part, I never affect to be anything but what I am&mdash;John
      Lilburne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the peer thus spoke, Vaudemont, leaning against the door, contemplated
      him with a strange mixture of interest and disgust. &ldquo;And John Lilburne is
      thought a great man, and William Gawtrey was a great rogue. You don&rsquo;t
      conceal your heart?&mdash;no, I understand. Wealth and power have no need
      of hypocrisy: you are the man of vice&mdash;Gawtrey, the man of crime. You
      never sin against the law&mdash;he was a felon by his trade. And the felon
      saved from vice the child, and from want the grandchild (Your flesh and
      blood) whom you disown: which will Heaven consider the worse man? No, poor
      Fanny, I see I am wrong. If he would own you, I would not give you up to
      the ice of such a soul:&mdash;better the blind man than the dead heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lord Lilburne,&rdquo; said De Vaudemont aloud, shaking off his reverie,
      &ldquo;I must own that your philosophy seems to me the wisest for yourself. For
      a poor man it might be different&mdash;the poor need affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the poor, certainly,&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne, with an air of patronising
      candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will own farther,&rdquo; continued De Vaudemont, &ldquo;that I have willingly
      lost my money in return for the instruction I have received in hearing you
      converse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are kind: come and take your revenge next Thursday. Adieu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Lilburne undressed, and his valet attended him, he said to that
      worthy functionary,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have not been able to make out the name of the stranger&mdash;the
      new lodger you tell me of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord. They only say he is a very fine-looking man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord. What do you wish me now to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Nothing at this moment! You manage things so badly, you might get
      me into a scrape. I never do anything which the law or the police, or even
      the news papers, can get hold of. I must think of some other way&mdash;humph!
      I never give up what I once commence, and I never fail in what I
      undertake! If life had been worth what fools trouble it with&mdash;business
      and ambition&mdash;I suppose I should have been a great man with a very
      bad liver&mdash;ha ha! I alone, of all the world, ever found out what the
      world was good for! Draw the curtains, Dykeman.&rdquo;

      If Vaudemont had fancied that, considering the age and poverty of Simon,
      it was his duty to see whether Fanny&rsquo;s not more legal, but more natural
      protector were, indeed, the unredeemed and unmalleable egotist which
      Gawtrey had painted him, the conversation of one night was sufficient to
      make him abandon for ever the notion of advancing her claims upon Lord
      Lilburne. But Philip had another motive in continuing his acquaintance
      with that personage. The sight of his mother&rsquo;s grave had recalled to him
      the image of that lost brother over whom he had vowed to watch. And,
      despite the deep sense of wronged affection with which he yet remembered
      the cruel letter that had contained the last tidings of Sidney, Philip&rsquo;s
      heart clung with undying fondness to that fair shape associated with all
      the happy recollections of childhood; and his conscience as well as his
      love asked him, each time that he passed the churchyard, &ldquo;Will you make no
      effort to obey that last prayer of the mother who consigned her darling to
      your charge?&rdquo; Perhaps, had Philip been in want, or had the name he now
      bore been sullied by his conduct, he might have shrunk from seeking one
      whom he might injure, but could not serve. But though not rich, he had
      more than enough for tastes as hardy and simple as any to which soldier of
      fortune ever limited his desires. And he thought, with a sentiment of just
      and noble pride, that the name which Eugenie had forced upon him had been
      borne spotless as the ermine through the trials and vicissitudes he had
      passed since he had assumed it. Sidney could give him nothing, and
      therefore it was his duty to seek Sidney out. Now, he had always believed
      in his heart that the Beauforts were acquainted with a secret which he
      more and more pined to penetrate. He would, for Sidney&rsquo;s sake, smother his
      hate to the Beauforts; he would not reject their acquaintance if thrown in
      his way; nay, secure in his change of name and his altered features, from
      all suspicion on their part, he would seek that acquaintance in order to
      find his brother and fulfil Catherine&rsquo;s last commands. His intercourse
      with Lilburne would necessarily bring him easily into contact with
      Lilburne&rsquo;s family. And in this thought he did not reject the invitations
      pressed on him. He felt, too, a dark and absorbing interest in examining a
      man who was in himself the incarnation of the World&mdash;the World of Art&mdash;the
      World as the Preacher paints it&mdash;the hollow, sensual, sharp-witted,
      self-wrapped WORLD&mdash;the World that is all for this life, and thinks
      of no Future and no God!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lilburne was, indeed, a study for deep contemplation. A study to
      perplex the ordinary thinker, and task to the utmost the analysis of more
      profound reflection. William Gawtrey had possessed no common talents; he
      had discovered that his life had been one mistake; Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s
      intellect was far keener than Gawtrey&rsquo;s, and he had never made, and if he
      had lived to the age of Old Parr, never would have made a similar
      discovery. He never wrestled against a law, though he slipped through all
      laws! And he knew no remorse, for he knew no fear. Lord Lilburne had
      married early, and long survived, a lady of fortune, the daughter of the
      then Premier&mdash;the best match, in fact, of his day. And for one very
      brief period of his life he had suffered himself to enter into the field
      of politics the only ambition common with men of equal rank. He showed
      talents that might have raised one so gifted by circumstance to any
      height, and then retired at once into his old habits and old system of
      pleasure. &ldquo;I wished to try,&rdquo; said he once, &ldquo;if fame was worth one
      headache, and I have convinced myself that the man who can sacrifice the
      bone in his mouth to the shadow of the bone in the water is a fool.&rdquo; From
      that time he never attended the House of Lords, and declared himself of no
      political opinions one way or the other. Nevertheless, the world had a
      general belief in his powers, and Vaudemont reluctantly subscribed to the
      world&rsquo;s verdict. Yet he had done nothing, he had read but little, he
      laughed at the world to its face,&mdash;and that last was, after all, the
      main secret of his ascendancy over those who were drawn into his circle.
      That contempt of the world placed the world at his feet. His sardonic and
      polished indifference, his professed code that there was no life worth
      caring for but his own life, his exemption from all cant, prejudice, and
      disguise, the frigid lubricity with which he glided out of the grasp of
      the Conventional, whenever it so pleased him, without shocking the
      Decorums whose sense is in their ear, and who are not roused by the deed
      but by the noise,&mdash;all this had in it the marrow and essence of a
      system triumphant with the vulgar; for little minds give importance to the
      man who gives importance to nothing. Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s authority, not in
      matters of taste alone, but in those which the world calls judgment and
      common sense, was regarded as an oracle. He cared not a straw for the
      ordinary baubles that attract his order; he had refused both an earldom
      and the garter, and this was often quoted in his honour. But you only try
      a man&rsquo;s virtue when you offer him something that he covets. The earldom
      and the garter were to Lord Lilburne no more tempting inducements than a
      doll or a skipping-rope; had you offered him an infallible cure for the
      gout, or an antidote against old age, you might have hired him as your
      lackey on your own terms. Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s next heir was the son of his
      only brother, a person entirely dependent on his uncle. Lord Lilburne
      allowed him L1000. a year and kept him always abroad in a diplomatic
      situation. He looked upon his successor as a man who wanted power, but not
      inclination, to become his assassin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he lived sumptuously and grudged himself nothing, Lord Lilburne was
      far from an extravagant man; he might, indeed, be considered close; for he
      knew how much of comfort and consideration he owed to his money, and
      valued it accordingly; he knew the best speculations and the best
      investments. If he took shares in an American canal, you might be sure
      that the shares would soon be double in value; if he purchased an estate,
      you might be certain it was a bargain. This pecuniary tact and success
      necessarily augmented his fame for wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been in early life a successful gambler, and some suspicions of his
      fair play had been noised abroad; but, as has been recently seen in the
      instance of a man of rank equal to Lilburne&rsquo;s, though, perhaps, of less
      acute if more cultivated intellect, it is long before the pigeon will turn
      round upon a falcon of breed and mettle. The rumours, indeed, were so
      vague as to carry with them no weight. During the middle of his career,
      when in the full flush of health and fortune, he had renounced the
      gaming-table. Of late years, as advancing age made time more heavy, he had
      resumed the resource, and with all his former good luck. The money-market,
      the table, the sex, constituted the other occupations and amusements with
      which Lord Lilburne filled up his rosy leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way by which this man had acquired reputation for ability was
      this,&mdash;he never pretended to any branch of knowledge of which he was
      ignorant, any more than to any virtue in which he was deficient. Honesty
      itself was never more free from quackery or deception than was this
      embodied and walking Vice. If the world chose to esteem him, he did not
      buy its opinion by imposture. No man ever saw Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s name in a
      public subscription, whether for a new church, or a Bible Society, or a
      distressed family, no man ever heard of his doing one generous,
      benevolent, or kindly action,&mdash;no man was ever startled by one
      philanthropic, pious, or amiable sentiment from those mocking lips. Yet,
      in spite of all this, John Lord Lilburne was not only esteemed but liked
      by the world, and set up in the chair of its Rhadamanthuses. In a word, he
      seemed to Vaudemont, and he was so in reality, a brilliant example of the
      might of Circumstance&mdash;an instance of what may be done in the way of
      reputation and influence by a rich, well-born man to whom the will a
      kingdom is. A little of genius, and Lord Lilburne would have made his
      vices notorious and his deficiencies glaring; a little of heart, and his
      habits would have led him into countless follies and discreditable
      scrapes. It was the lead and the stone that he carried about him that
      preserved his equilibrium, no matter which way the breeze blew. But all
      his qualities, positive or negative, would have availed him nothing
      without that position which enabled him to take his ease in that inn, the
      world&mdash;which presented, to every detection of his want of intrinsic
      nobleness, the irreproachable respectability of a high name, a splendid
      mansion, and a rent-roll without a flaw. Vaudemont drew comparisons
      between Lilburne and Gawtrey, and he comprehended at last, why one was a
      low rascal and the other a great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was but a few days after their first introduction to each
      other, Vaudemont had been twice to Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s, and their acquaintance
      was already on an easy footing&mdash;when one afternoon as the former was
      riding through the streets towards H&mdash;&mdash;, he met the peer
      mounted on a stout cob, which, from its symmetrical strength, pure English
      breed, and exquisite grooming, showed something of those sporting tastes
      for which, in earlier life, Lord Lilburne had been noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Monsieur de Vaudemont, what brings you to this part of the town?&mdash;curiosity
      and the desire to explore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That might be natural enough in me; but you, who know London so well;
      rather what brings you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I am returned from a long ride. I have had symptoms of a fit of the
      gout, and been trying to keep it off by exercise. I have been to a cottage
      that belongs to me, some miles from the town&mdash;a pretty place enough,
      by the way&mdash;you must come and see me there next month. I shall fill
      the house for a battue! I have some tolerable covers&mdash;you are a good
      shot, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not practised, except with a rifle, for some years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity; for as I think a week&rsquo;s shooting once a year quite enough,
      I fear that your visit to me at Fernside may not be sufficiently long to
      put your hand in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fernside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; is the name familiar to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have heard it before. Did your lordship purchase or inherit
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought it of my brother-in-law. It belonged to his brother&mdash;a gay,
      wild sort of fellow, who broke his neck over a six-barred gate; through
      that gate my friend Robert walked the same day into a very fine estate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard so. The late Mr. Beaufort, then, left no children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; two. But they came into the world in the primitive way in which Mr.
      Owen wishes us all to come&mdash;too naturally for the present state of
      society, and Mr. Owen&rsquo;s parallelogram was not ready for them. By the way,
      one of them disappeared at Paris&mdash;you never met with him, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under what name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morton! hem! What Christian name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip! no. But did Mr. Beaufort do nothing for the young men? I think I
      have heard somewhere that he took compassion on one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you? Ah, my brother-in-law is precisely one of those excellent men
      of whom the world always speaks well. No; he would very willingly have
      served either or both the boys, but the mother refused all his overtures
      and went to law, I fancy. The elder of these bastards turned out a sad
      fellow, and the younger,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know exactly where he is, but no
      doubt with one of his mother&rsquo;s relations. You seem to interest yourself in
      natural children, my dear Vaudemont?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have heard that people have doubted if I were a natural son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I understand now. But are you going?&mdash;I was in hopes you would
      have turned back my way, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good; but I have a particular appointment, and I am now too
      late. Good morning, Lord Lilburne.&rdquo; Sidney with one of his mother&rsquo;s
      relations! Returned, perhaps, to the Mortons! How had he never before
      chanced on a conjecture so probable? He would go at once!&mdash;that very
      night he would go to the house from which he had taken his brother. At
      least, and at the worst, they might give him some clue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buoyed with this hope and this resolve, he rode hastily to H&mdash;&mdash;-,
      to announce to Simon and Fanny that he should not return to them, perhaps,
      for two or three days. As he entered the suburb, he drew up by the
      statuary of whom he had purchased his mother&rsquo;s gravestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist of the melancholy trade was at work in his yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! there!&rdquo; said Vaudemont, looking over the low railing; &ldquo;is the tomb I
      have ordered nearly finished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir, as you were so anxious for despatch, and as it would take a
      long time to get a new one ready, I thought of giving you this, which is
      finished all but the inscription. It was meant for Miss Deborah Primme;
      but her nephew and heir called on me yesterday to say, that as the poor
      lady died worth less by L5,000. than he had expected, he thought a
      handsome wooden tomb would do as well, if I could get rid of this for him.
      It is a beauty, sir. It will look so cheerful&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that will do: and you can place it now where I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In three days, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo; And he rode on, muttering, &ldquo;Fanny, your pious wish will be
      fulfilled. But flowers,&mdash;will they suit that stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put up his horse, and walked through the lane to Simon&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the house, he saw Fanny&rsquo;s bright eyes at the window. She
      was watching his return. She hastened to open the door to him, and the
      world&rsquo;s wanderer felt what music there is in the footstep, what summer
      there is in the smile, of Welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Fanny,&rdquo; he said, affected by her joyous greeting, &ldquo;it makes my
      heart warm to see you. I have brought you a present from town. When I was
      a boy, I remember that my poor mother was fond of singing some simple
      songs, which often, somehow or other, come back to me, when I see and hear
      you. I fancied you would understand and like them as well at least as I do&mdash;for
      Heaven knows (he added to himself) my ear is dull enough generally to the
      jingle of rhyme.&rdquo; And he placed in her hands a little volume of those
      exquisite songs, in which Burns has set Nature to music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are so kind, brother,&rdquo; said Fanny, with tears swimming in her
      eyes, and she kissed the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      After their simple meal, Vaudemont broke to Fanny and Simon the
      intelligence of his intended departure for a few days. Simon heard it with
      the silent apathy into which, except on rare occasions, his life had
      settled. But Fanny turned away her face and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but for a day or two, Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour is very&mdash;very long sometimes,&rdquo; said the girl, shaking her
      head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, I have a little time yet left, and the air is mild, you have not
      been out to-day, shall we walk&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; interrupted Simon, clearing his throat, and seeming to start into
      sudden animation; &ldquo;had not you better settle the board and lodging before
      you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, grandfather!&rdquo; cried Fanny, springing to her feet, with such a blush
      upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, child,&rdquo; said Vaudemont, laughingly; &ldquo;your grandfather only
      anticipates me. But do not talk of board and lodging; Fanny is as a sister
      to me, and our purse is in common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to feel a sovereign&mdash;just to feel it,&rdquo; muttered Simon,
      in a sort of apologetic tone, that was really pathetic; and as Vaudemont
      scattered some coins on the table, the old man clawed them up, chuckling
      and talking to himself; and, rising with great alacrity, hobbled out of
      the room like a raven carrying some cunning theft to its hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was so amusing to Vaudemont that he burst out fairly into an
      uncontrollable laughter. Fanny looked at him, humbled and wondering for
      some moments; and then, creeping to him, put her hand gently on his arm
      and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh&mdash;it pains me. It was not nice in grand papa; but&mdash;but,
      it does not mean anything. It&mdash;it&mdash;don&rsquo;t laugh&mdash;Fanny feels
      so sad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are right. Come, put on your bonnet, we will go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny obeyed; but with less ready delight than usual. And they took their
      way through lanes over which hung, still in the cool air, the leaves of
      the yellow autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was the first to break silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said, timidly, &ldquo;that people here think me very silly?&mdash;do
      you think so too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont was startled by the simplicity of the question, and hesitated.
      Fanny looked up in his dark face anxiously and inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Fanny, there are some things in which I could wish you less
      childlike and, perhaps, less charming. Those strange snatches of song, for
      instance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! do you not like me to sing? It is my way of talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; sing, pretty one! But sing something that we can understand,&mdash;sing
      the songs I have given you, if you will. And now, may I ask why you put to
      me that question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have forgotten,&rdquo; said Fanny, absently, and looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at that instant, as Philip Vaudemont bent over the exceeding
      sweetness of that young face, a sudden thrill shot through his heart, and
      he, too, became silent, and lost in thought. Was it possible that there
      could creep into his breast a wilder affection for this creature than that
      of tenderness and pity? He was startled as the idea crossed him. He shrank
      from it as a profanation&mdash;as a crime&mdash;as a frenzy. He with his
      fate so uncertain and chequered&mdash;he to link himself with one so
      helpless&mdash;he to debase the very poetry that clung to the mental
      temperament of this pure being, with the feelings which every fair face
      may awaken to every coarse heart&mdash;to love Fanny! No, it was
      impossible! For what could he love in her but beauty, which the very
      spirit had forgotten to guard? And she&mdash;could she even know what love
      was? He despised himself for even admitting such a thought; and with that
      iron and hardy vigour which belonged to his mind, resolved to watch
      closely against every fancy that would pass the fairy boundary which
      separated Fanny from the world of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was roused from this self-commune by an abrupt exclamation from his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I recollect now why I asked you that question. There is one thing
      that always puzzles me&mdash;I want you to explain it. Why does everything
      in life depend upon money? You see even my poor grandfather forgot how
      good you are to us both, when&mdash;when Ah! I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;it
      pains&mdash;it puzzles me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny, look there&mdash;no, to the left&mdash;you see that old woman, in
      rags, crawling wearily along; turn now to the right&mdash;you see that
      fine house glancing through the trees, with a carriage and four at the
      gates? The difference between that old woman and the owner of that house
      is&mdash;Money; and who shall blame your grandfather for liking Money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny understood; and while the wise man thus moralised, the girl, whom
      his very compassion so haughtily contemned, moved away to the old woman to
      do her little best to smooth down those disparities from which wisdom and
      moralising never deduct a grain! Vaudemont felt this as he saw her glide
      towards the beggar; but when she came bounding back to him, she had
      forgotten his dislike to her songs, and was chaunting, in the glee of the
      heart that a kind act had made glad, one of her own impromptu melodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont turned away. Poor Fanny had unconsciously decided his
      self-conquest; she guessed not what passed within him, but she suddenly
      recollected&mdash;what he had said to her about her songs, and fancied him
      displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah I will never do it again. Brother, don&rsquo;t turn away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must go home. Hark! the clock strikes seven&mdash;I have no time
      to lose. And you will promise me never to stir out till I return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have no heart to stir out,&rdquo; said Fanny, sadly; and then in a more
      cheerful voice, she added, &ldquo;And I shall sing the songs you like before you
      come back again!&rdquo;

</pre>
    <p>
      And once more, sweet Winandermere, we are on the banks of thy happy lake!
      The softest ray of the soft clear sun of early autumn trembled on the
      fresh waters, and glanced through the leaves of the limes and willows that
      were reflected&mdash;distinct as a home for the Naiads&mdash;beneath the
      limpid surface. You might hear in the bushes the young blackbirds trilling
      their first untutored notes. And the graceful dragon-fly, his wings
      glittering in the translucent sunshine, darted to and fro&mdash;the reeds
      gathered here and there in the mimic bays that broke the shelving marge of
      the grassy shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by that grassy shore, and beneath those shadowy limes, sat the young
      lovers. It was the very place where Spencer had first beheld Camilla. And
      now they were met to say, &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Camilla!&rdquo; said he, with great emotion, and eyes that swam in tears,
      &ldquo;be firm&mdash;be true. You know how my whole life is wrapped up in your
      love. You go amidst scenes where all will tempt you to forget me. I linger
      behind in those which are consecrated by your remembrance, which will
      speak to me every hour of you. Camilla, since you do love me&mdash;you do&mdash;do
      you not?&mdash;since you have confessed it&mdash;since your parents have
      consented to our marriage, provided only that your love last (for of mine
      there can be no doubt) for one year&mdash;one terrible year&mdash;shall I
      not trust you as truth itself? And yet how darkly I despair at times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Camilla innocently took the hands that, clasped together, were raised to
      her, as if in supplication, and pressed them kindly between her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not doubt me&mdash;never doubt my affection. Has not my father
      consented? Reflect, it is but a year&rsquo;s delay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year!&mdash;can you speak thus of a year&mdash;a whole year? Not to see&mdash;not
      to hear you for a whole year, except in my dreams! And, if at the end your
      parents waver? Your father&mdash;I distrust him still. If this delay is
      but meant to wean you from me,&mdash;if, at the end, there are new excuses
      found,&mdash;if they then, for some cause or other not now foreseen, still
      refuse their assent? You&mdash;may I not still look to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Camilla sighed heavily; and turning her meek face on her lover, said,
      timidly, &ldquo;Never think that so short a time can make me unfaithful, and do
      not suspect that my father will break his promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, if he does, you will still be mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Charles, how could you esteem me as a wife if I were to tell you I
      could forget I am a daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said so touchingly, and with so perfect a freedom from all
      affectation, that her lover could only reply by covering her hand with his
      kisses. And it was not till after a pause that he continued passionately,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do but show me how much deeper is my love than yours. You can never
      dream how I love you. But I do not ask you to love me as well&mdash;it
      would be impossible. My life from my earliest childhood has been passed in
      these solitudes;&mdash;a happy life, though tranquil and monotonous, till
      you suddenly broke upon it. You seemed to me the living form of the very
      poetry I had worshipped&mdash;so bright&mdash;so heavenly&mdash;I loved
      you from the very first moment that we met. I am not like other men of my
      age. I have no pursuit&mdash;no occupation&mdash;nothing to abstract me
      from your thought. And I love you so purely&mdash;so devotedly, Camilla. I
      have never known even a passing fancy for another. You are the first&mdash;the
      only woman&mdash;it ever seemed to me possible to love. You are my Eve&mdash;your
      presence my paradise! Think how sad I shall be when you are gone&mdash;how
      I shall visit every spot your footstep has hallowed&mdash;how I shall
      count every moment till the year is past!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he thus spoke, he had risen in that restless agitation which belongs
      to great emotion; and Camilla now rose also, and said soothingly, as she
      laid her hand on his shoulder with tender but modest frankness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall I not also think of you? I am sad to feel that you will be so
      much alone&mdash;no sister&mdash;no brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not grieve for that. The memory of you will be dearer to me than
      comfort from all else. And you will be true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Camilla made no answer by words, but her eyes and her colour spoke. And in
      that moment, while plighting eternal truth, they forgot that they were
      about to part!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in a room in the house which, screened by the foliage, was only
      partially visible where the lovers stood, sat Mr. Robert Beaufort and Mr.
      Spencer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, sir,&rdquo; said the former, &ldquo;that I am not insensible to the
      merits of your nephew and to the very handsome proposals you make, still I
      cannot consent to abridge the time I have named. They are both very young.
      What is a year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long time when it is a year of suspense,&rdquo; said the recluse,
      shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a longer time when it is a year of domestic dissension and
      repentance. And it is a very true proverb, &lsquo;Marry in haste and repent at
      leisure.&rsquo; No! If at the end of the year the young people continue of the
      same mind, and no unforeseen circumstances occur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No unforeseen circumstances, Mr. Beaufort!&mdash;that is a new condition&mdash;it
      is a very vague phrase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, it is hard to please you. Unforeseen circumstances,&rdquo; said
      the wary father, with a wise look, &ldquo;mean circumstances that we don&rsquo;t
      foresee at present. I assure you that I have no intention to trifle with
      you, and I shall be sincerely happy in so respectable a connexion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young people may write to each other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll consult Mrs. Beaufort. At all events, it must not be very
      often, and Camilla is well brought up, and will show all the letters to
      her mother. I don&rsquo;t much like a correspondence of that nature. It often
      leads to unpleasant results; if, for instance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if the parties change their minds, and my girl were to marry
      another. It is not prudent in matters of business, my dear sir, to put
      down anything on paper that can be avoided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spencer opened his eyes. &ldquo;Matters of business, Mr. Beaufort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, is not marriage a matter of business, and a very grave matter too?
      More lawsuits about marriage and settlements, &amp;c., than I like to
      think of. But to change the subject. You have never heard anything more of
      those young men, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, rather inaudibly, and looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is your firm impression that the elder one, Philip, is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a very vexatious and improper lawsuit their mother brought
      against me. Do you know that some wretched impostor, who, it appears, is a
      convict broke loose before his time, has threatened me with another, on
      the part of one of those young men? You never heard anything of it&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, upon my honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, of course, you would not countenance so villanous an attempt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because that would break off our contract at once. But you are too much a
      gentleman and a man of honour. Forgive me so improper a question. As for
      the younger Mr. Morton, I have no ill-feeling against him. But the elder!
      Oh, a thorough reprobate! a very alarming character! I could have nothing
      to do with any member of the family while the elder lived; it would only
      expose me to every species of insult and imposition. And now I think we
      have left our young friends alone long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But stay, to prevent future misunderstanding, I may as well read over
      again the heads of the arrangement you honour me by proposing. You agree
      to settle your fortune after your decease, amounting to L23,000. and your
      house, with twenty-five acres one rood and two poles, more or less, upon
      your nephew and my daughter, jointly&mdash;remainder to their children.
      Certainly, without offence, in a worldly point of view, Camilla might do
      better; still, you are so very respectable, and you speak so handsomely,
      that I cannot touch upon that point; and I own, that though there is a
      large nominal rent-roll attached to Beaufort Court (indeed, there is not a
      finer property in the county), yet there are many incumbrances, and ready
      money would not be convenient to me. Arthur&mdash;poor fellow, a very fine
      young man, sir,&mdash;is, as I have told you in perfect confidence, a
      little imprudent and lavish; in short, your offer to dispense with any
      dowry is extremely liberal, and proves your nephew is actuated by no
      mercenary feelings: such conduct prepossesses me highly in your favour and
      his too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Spencer bowed, and the great man rising, with a stiff affectation of
      kindly affability, put his arm into the uncle&rsquo;s, and strolled with him
      across the lawn towards the lovers. And such is life&mdash;love on the
      lawn and settlements in the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover was the first to perceive the approach of the elder parties. And
      a change came over his face as he saw the dry aspect and marked the
      stealthy stride of his future father-in-law; for then there flashed across
      him a dreary reminiscence of early childhood; the happy evening when, with
      his joyous father, that grave and ominous aspect was first beheld; and
      then the dismal burial, the funereal sables, the carriage at the door, and
      he himself clinging to the cold uncle to ask him to say a word of comfort
      to the mother, who now slept far away. &ldquo;Well, my young friend,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Beaufort, patronisingly, &ldquo;your good uncle and myself are quite agreed&mdash;a
      little time for reflection, that&rsquo;s all. Oh! I don&rsquo;t think the worse of you
      for wishing to abridge it. But papas must be papas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was so little jocular about that sedate man, that this attempt at
      jovial good humour seemed harsh and grating&mdash;the hinges of that wily
      mouth wanted oil for a hearty smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be faint-hearted, Mr. Charles. &lsquo;Faint heart,&rsquo;&mdash;you know
      the proverb. You must stay and dine with us. We return to-morrow to town.
      I should tell you, that I received this morning a letter from my son
      Arthur, announcing his return from Baden, so we must give him the meeting&mdash;a
      very joyful one you may guess. We have not seen him these three years.
      Poor fellow! he says he has been very ill and the waters have ceased to do
      him any good. But a little quiet and country air at Beaufort Court will
      set him up, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus running on about his son, then about his shooting&mdash;about
      Beaufort Court and its splendours&mdash;about parliament and its fatigues&mdash;about
      the last French Revolution, and the last English election&mdash;about Mrs.
      Beaufort and her good qualities and bad health&mdash;about, in short,
      everything relating to himself, some things relating to the public, and
      nothing that related to the persons to whom his conversation was directed,
      Mr. Robert Beaufort wore away half an hour, when the Spencer&rsquo;s took their
      leave, promising to return to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; said Mr. Spencer, as the boat, which the young man rowed,
      bounded over the water towards their quiet home; &ldquo;Charles, I dislike these
      Beauforts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is beautiful, and seems good; not so handsome as your poor
      mother, but who ever was?&rdquo;&mdash;here Mr. Spencer sighed, and repeated
      some lines from Shenstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Mr. Beaufort suspects in the least who I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that puzzles me; I rather think he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is the cause of the delay? I knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, on the contrary, I incline to think he has some kindly feeling to
      you, though not to your brother, and that it is such a feeling that made
      him consent to your marriage. He sifted me very closely as to what I knew
      of the young Mortons&mdash;observed that you were very handsome, and that
      he had fancied at first that he had seen you before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes: and looked hard at me while he spoke; and said more than once,
      significantly, &lsquo;So his name is Charles?&rsquo; He talked about some attempt at
      imposture and litigation, but that was, evidently, merely invented to
      sound me about your brother&mdash;whom, of course, he spoke ill of&mdash;impressing
      on me three or four times that he would never have anything to say to any
      of the family while Philip lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you told him,&rdquo; said the young man, hesitatingly, and with a deep
      blush of shame over his face, &ldquo;that you were persuaded&mdash;that is, that
      you believed Philip was&mdash;was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was dead! Yes&mdash;and without confusion. For the more I reflect, the
      more I think he must be dead. At all events, you may be sure that he is
      dead to us, that we shall never hear more of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Philip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your feelings are natural; they are worthy of your excellent heart; but
      remember, what would have become of you if you had stayed with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; said the brother, with a slight shudder&mdash;&ldquo;a career of
      suffering&mdash;crime&mdash;perhaps the gibbet! Ah! what do I owe you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner-party at Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s that day was constrained and formal,
      though the host, in unusual good humour, sought to make himself agreeable.
      Mrs. Beaufort, languid and afflicted with headache, said little. The two
      Spencers were yet more silent. But the younger sat next to her he loved;
      and both hearts were full: and in the evening they contrived to creep
      apart into a corner by the window, through which the starry heavens looked
      kindly on them. They conversed in whispers, with long pauses between each:
      and at times Camilla&rsquo;s tears flowed silently down her cheeks, and were
      followed by the false smiles intended to cheer her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time did not fly, but crept on breathlessly and heavily. And then came the
      last parting&mdash;formal, cold&mdash;before witnesses. But the lover
      could not restrain his emotion, and the hard father heard his suppressed
      sob as he closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will now be well to explain the cause of Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s heightened
      spirits, and the motives of his conduct with respect to his daughter&rsquo;s
      suitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, perhaps, can be best done by laying before the reader the following
      letters that passed between Mr. Beaufort and Lord Lilburne.
    </p>
    <p>
      From LORD LILBURNE to ROBERT BEAUFORT, ESQ., M.P.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR BEAUFORT,&mdash;I think I have settled, pretty satisfactorily, your
      affair with your unwelcome visitor. The first thing it seemed to me
      necessary to do, was to learn exactly what and who he was, and with what
      parties that could annoy you he held intercourse. I sent for Sharp, the
      Bow Street officer, and placed him in the hall to mark, and afterwards to
      dog and keep watch on your new friend. The moment the latter entered I saw
      at once, from his dress and his address, that he was a &lsquo;scamp;&rsquo; and
      thought it highly inexpedient to place you in his power by any money
      transactions. While talking with him, Sharp sent in a billet containing
      his recognition of our gentleman as a transported convict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acted accordingly; soon saw, from the fellow&rsquo;s manner, that he had
      returned before his time; and sent him away with a promise, which you may
      be sure he believes will be kept, that if he molest you farther, he shall
      return to the colonies, and that if his lawsuit proceed, his witness or
      witnesses shall be indicted for conspiracy and perjury. Make your mind
      easy so far. For the rest, I own to you that I think what he says probable
      enough: but my object in setting Sharp to watch him is to learn what other
      parties he sees. And if there be really anything formidable in his proofs
      or witnesses, it is with those other parties I advise you to deal. Never
      transact business with the go between, if you can with the principal.
      Remember, the two young men are the persons to arrange with after all.
      They must be poor, and therefore easily dealt with. For, if poor, they
      will think a bird in the hand worth two in the bush of a lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, through Mr. Spencer, you can learn anything of either of the young
      men, do so; and try and open some channel, through which you can always
      establish a communication with them, if necessary. Perhaps, by learning
      their early history, you may learn something to put them into your power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had a twinge of the gout this morning, and am likely, I fear, to
      be laid up for some weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LILBURNE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Sharp has just been here. He followed the man who calls
      himself &lsquo;Captain Smith&rsquo; to a house in Lambeth, where he lodges, and from
      which he did not stir till midnight, when Sharp ceased his watch. On
      renewing it this morning, he found that the captain had gone off, to what
      place Sharp has not yet discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn this immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From ROBERT BEAUFORT, ESQ., M.P., to the LORD LILBURNE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR, LILBURNE,&mdash;Accept my warmest thanks for your kindness; you
      have done admirably, and I do not see that I have anything further to
      apprehend. I suspect that it was an entire fabrication on that man&rsquo;s part,
      and your firmness has foiled his wicked designs. Only think, I have
      discovered&mdash;I am sure of it&mdash;one of the Mortons; and he, too,
      though the younger, yet, in all probability, the sole pretender the fellow
      could set up. You remember that the child Sidney had disappeared
      mysteriously,&mdash;you remember also, how much that Mr. Spencer had
      interested himself in finding out the same Sidney. Well,&mdash;this
      gentleman at the Lakes is, as we suspected, the identical Mr. Spencer, and
      his soi-disant nephew, Camilla&rsquo;s suitor, is assuredly no other than the
      lost Sidney. The moment I saw the young man I recognised him, for he is
      very little altered, and has a great look of his mother into the bargain.
      Concealing my more than suspicions, I, however, took care to sound Mr.
      Spencer (a very poor soul), and his manner was so embarrassed as to leave
      no doubt of the matter; but in asking him what he had heard of the
      brothers, I had the satisfaction of learning that, in all human
      probability, the elder is dead: of this Mr. Spencer seems convinced. I
      also assured myself that neither Spencer nor the young man had the
      remotest connection with our Captain Smith, nor any idea of litigation.
      This is very satisfactory, you will allow. And now, I hope you will
      approve of what I have done. I find that young Morton, or Spencer, as he
      is called, is desperately enamoured of Camilla; he seems a meek,
      well-conditioned, amiable young man; writes poetry;&mdash;in short, rather
      weak than otherwise. I have demanded a year&rsquo;s delay, to allow mutual trial
      and reflection. This gives us the channel for constant information which
      you advise me to establish, and I shall have the opportunity to learn if
      the impostor makes any communication to them, or if there be any news of
      the brother. If by any trick or chicanery (for I will never believe that
      there was a marriage) a lawsuit that might be critical or hazardous can be
      cooked up, I can, I am sure, make such terms with Sidney, through his love
      for my daughter, as would effectively and permanently secure me from all
      further trouble and machinations in regard to my property. And if, during
      the year, we convince ourselves that, after all, there is not a leg of law
      for any claimant to stand on, I may be guided by other circumstances how
      far I shall finally accept or reject the suit. That must depend on any
      other views we may then form for Camilla; and I shall not allow a hint of
      such an engagement to get abroad. At the worst, as Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s heir, it
      is not so very bad a match, seeing that they dispense with all marriage
      portion, &amp;c.&mdash;a proof how easily they can be managed. I have not
      let Mr. Spencer see that I have discovered his secret&mdash;I can do that
      or not, according to circumstances hereafter; neither have I said anything
      of my discovery to Mrs. B., or Camilla. At present, &lsquo;Least said soonest
      mended.&rsquo; I heard from Arthur to-day. He is on his road home, and we hasten
      to town, sooner than we expected, to meet him. He complains still of his
      health. We shall all go down to Beaufort Court. I write this at night, the
      pretended uncle and sham nephew having just gone. But though we start
      to-morrow, you will get this a day or two before we arrive, as Mrs.
      Beaufort&rsquo;s health renders short stages necessary. I really do hope that
      Arthur, also, will not be an invalid, poor fellow! one in a family is
      quite enough; and I find Mrs. Beaufort&rsquo;s delicacy very inconvenient,
      especially in moving about and in keeping up one&rsquo;s county connexions. A
      young man&rsquo;s health, however, is soon restored. I am very sorry to hear of
      your gout, except that it carries off all other complaints. I am very
      well, thank Heaven; indeed, my health has been much better of late years:
      Beaufort Court agrees with me so well! The more I reflect, the more I am
      astonished at the monstrous and wicked impudence of that fellow&mdash;to
      defraud a man out of his own property! You are quite right,&mdash;certainly
      a conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours truly, &ldquo;R. B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;I shall keep a constant eye on the Spencers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn this immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After he had written and sealed this letter, Mr. Beaufort went to bed and
      slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next day that place was desolate, and the board on the lawn
      announced that it was again to be let. But thither daily, in rain or
      sunshine, came the solitary lover, as a bird that seeks its young in the
      deserted nest:&mdash;Again and again he haunted the spot where he had
      strayed with the lost one,&mdash;and again and again murmured his
      passionate vows beneath the fast-fading limes. Are those vows destined to
      be ratified or annulled? Will the absent forget, or the lingerer be
      consoled? Had the characters of that young romance been lightly stamped on
      the fancy where once obliterated they are erased for ever,&mdash;or were
      they graven deep in those tablets where the writing, even when invisible,
      exists still, and revives, sweet letter by letter, when the light and the
      warmth borrowed from the One Bright Presence are applied to the faithful
      record? There is but one Wizard to disclose that secret, as all others,&mdash;the
      old Grave-digger, whose Churchyard is the Earth,&mdash;whose trade is to
      find burial-places for Passions that seemed immortal,&mdash;disinterring
      the ashes of some long-crumbling Memory&mdash;to hollow out the dark bed
      of some new-perished Hope:&mdash;He who determines all things, and
      prophesies none,&mdash;for his oracles are uncomprehended till the doom is
      sealed&mdash;He who in the bloom of the fairest affection detects the
      hectic that consumes it, and while the hymn rings at the altar, marks with
      his joyless eye the grave for the bridal vow.&mdash;Wherever is the
      sepulchre, there is thy temple, O melancholy Time!

    <p>
      Mr. Roger Morton was behind his counter one drizzling, melancholy day. Mr.
      Roger Morton, alderman, and twice mayor of his native town, was a thriving
      man. He had grown portly and corpulent. The nightly potations of brandy
      and water, continued year after year with mechanical perseverance, had
      deepened the roses on his cheek. Mr. Roger Morton was never intoxicated&mdash;he
      &ldquo;only made himself comfortable.&rdquo; His constitution was strong; but, somehow
      or other, his digestion was not as good as it might be. He was certain
      that something or other disagreed with him. He left off the joint one day&mdash;the
      pudding another. Now he avoided vegetables as poison&mdash;and now he
      submitted with a sigh to the doctor&rsquo;s interdict of his cigar. Mr. Roger
      Morton never thought of leaving off the brandy and water: and he would
      have resented as the height of impertinent insinuation any hint upon that
      score to a man of so sober and respectable a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Roger Morton was seated&mdash;for the last four years, ever since his
      second mayoralty, he had arrogated to himself the dignity of a chair. He
      received rather than served his customers. The latter task was left to two
      of his sons. For Tom, after much cogitation, the profession of an
      apothecary had been selected. Mrs. Morton observed, that it was a genteel
      business, and Tom had always been a likely lad. And Mr. Roger considered
      that it would be a great comfort and a great saving to have his medical
      adviser in his own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two sons and the various attendants of the shop were plying the
      profitable trade, as customer after customer, with umbrellas and in
      pattens, dropped into the tempting shelter&mdash;when a man, meanly
      dressed, and who was somewhat past middle age, with a careworn, hungry
      face, entered timidly. He waited in patience by the crowded counter,
      elbowed by sharp-boned and eager spinsters&mdash;and how sharp the elbows
      of spinsters are, no man can tell who has not forced his unwelcome way
      through the agitated groups in a linendraper&rsquo;s shop!&mdash;the man, I say,
      waited patiently and sadly, till the smallest of the shopboys turned from
      a lady, who, after much sorting and shading, had finally decided on two
      yards of lilac-coloured penny riband, and asked, in an insinuating
      professional tone,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I show you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to speak to Mr. Morton. Which is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morton is engaged, sir. I can give you what you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it is a matter of business&mdash;important business.&rdquo; The boy
      eyed the napless and dripping hat, the gloveless hands, and the rusty
      neckcloth of the speaker; and said, as he passed his fingers through a
      profusion of light curls &ldquo;Mr. Morton don&rsquo;t attend much to business himself
      now; but that&rsquo;s he. Any cravats, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man made no answer, but moved where, near the window, and chatting
      with the banker of the town (as the banker tried on a pair of beaver
      gloves), sat still&mdash;after due apology for sitting&mdash;Mr. Roger
      Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alderman lowered his spectacles as he glanced grimly at the lean
      apparition that shaded the spruce banker, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me, friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, if you please;&rdquo; and the man took off his shabby hat, and bowed
      low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, speak out. No begging petition, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! Your nephews&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker turned round, and in his turn eyed the newcomer. The
      linendraper started back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nephews!&rdquo; he repeated, with a bewildered look. &ldquo;What does the man mean?
      Wait a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; said the banker, smiling. &ldquo;I am glad to find we agree so
      well upon this question: I knew we should. Our member will never suit us
      if he goes on in this way. Trade must take care of itself. Good day to
      You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nephews!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Morton, rising, and beckoning to the man to follow
      him into the back parlour, where Mrs. Morton sat casting up the washing
      bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the husband, closing the door, &ldquo;what do you mean, my good
      fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, what I wish to ask you is&mdash;if you can tell me what has become
      of&mdash;of the young Beau&mdash;, that is, of your sister&rsquo;s sons. I
      understand there were two&mdash;and I am told that&mdash;that they are
      both dead. Is it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that to you, friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An please you, sir, it is a great deal to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;ha! ha! it is a great deal to everybody whether they are alive
      or dead!&rdquo; Mr. Morton, since he had been mayor, now and then had his joke.
      &ldquo;But really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roger!&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton, under her breath&mdash;&ldquo;Roger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come this way&mdash;I want to speak to you about this bill.&rdquo; The husband
      approached, and bent over his wife. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend on it, he has some claim to make&mdash;some bills or something.
      Don&rsquo;t commit yourself&mdash;the boys are dead for what we know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton hemmed and returned to his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I am not aware of what has become of the young
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they are not dead&mdash;I thought not!&rdquo; exclaimed the man, joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than I can say. It&rsquo;s many years since I lost sight of the
      only one I ever saw; and they may be both dead for what I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Then you can give me no kind of&mdash;of&mdash;hint
      like, to find them out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Do they owe you anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not signify talking now, sir. I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay&mdash;who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a very poor man, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor! Oh, very well&mdash;very well. You have done with me now. Good day&mdash;good
      day. I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger pecked for a moment at his hat&mdash;turned the handle of the
      door&mdash;peered under his grey eyebrows at the portly trader, who, with
      both hands buried in his pockets, his mouth pursed up, like a man about to
      say &ldquo;No&rdquo; fidgeted uneasily behind Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s chair. He sighed, shook
      his head, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton rang the bell&mdash;the maid-servant entered. &ldquo;Wipe the
      carpet, Jenny;&mdash;dirty feet! Mr. Morton, it&rsquo;s a Brussels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not my fault, my dear. I could not talk about family matters
      before the whole shop. Do you know, I&rsquo;d quite forgot those poor boys. This
      unsettles me. Poor Catherine! she was so fond of them. A pretty boy that
      Sidney, too. What can have become of them? My heart rebukes me. I wish I
      had asked the man more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More!&mdash;why he was just going to beg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg&mdash;yes&mdash;very true!&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, pausing irresolutely;
      and then, with a hearty tone, he cried out, &ldquo;And, damme, if he had begged,
      I could afford him a shilling! I&rsquo;ll go after him.&rdquo; So saying, he hastened
      back through the shop, but the man was gone&mdash;the rain was falling,
      Mr. Morton had his thin shoes on&mdash;he blew his nose, and went back to
      the counter. But, there, still rose to his memory the pale face of his
      dead sister; and a voice murmured in his ear, &ldquo;Brother, where is my
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! it is not my fault if he ran away. Bob, go and get me the county
      paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton had again settled himself, and was deep in a trial for murder,
      when another stranger strode haughtily into the shop. The new-comer,
      wrapped in a pelisse of furs, with a thick moustache, and an eye that took
      in the whole shop, from master to boy, from ceiling to floor, in a glance,
      had the air at once of a foreigner and a soldier. Every look fastened on
      him, as he paused an instant, and then walking up to the alderman, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, you are doubtless Mr. Morton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your commands, sir,&rdquo; said Roger, rising involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A word with you, then, on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Morton, turning rather pale, for he began to think
      himself haunted; &ldquo;anything in my line, sir? I should be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger bent down his tall stature, and hissed into Mr. Morton&rsquo;s
      foreboding ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your nephews!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton was literally dumb-stricken. Yes, he certainly was haunted! He
      stared at this second questioner, and fancied that there was something
      very supernatural and unearthly about him. He was so tall, and so dark,
      and so stern, and so strange. Was it the Unspeakable himself come for the
      linendraper? Nephews again! The uncle of the babes in the wood could
      hardly have been more startled by the demand!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Morton at last, recovering his dignity and somewhat
      peevishly,&mdash;&ldquo;sir, I don&rsquo;t know why people should meddle with my
      family affairs. I don&rsquo;t ask other folks about their nephews. I have no
      nephew that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to speak to you, alone, for one instant.&rdquo; Mr. Morton sighed,
      hitched up his trousers, and led the way to the parlour, where Mrs.
      Morton, having finished the washing bills, was now engaged in tying
      certain pieces of bladder round certain pots of preserves. The eldest Miss
      Morton, a young woman of five or six-and-twenty, who was about to be very
      advantageously married to a young gentleman who dealt in coals and played
      the violin (for N&mdash;&mdash;- was a very musical town), had just joined
      her for the purpose of extorting &ldquo;The Swiss Boy, with variations,&rdquo; out of
      a sleepy little piano, that emitted a very painful cry under the awakening
      fingers of Miss Margaret Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton threw open the door with a grunt, and the stranger pausing at
      the threshold, the full flood of sound (key C) upon which &ldquo;the Swiss Boy&rdquo;
       was swimming along, &ldquo;kine&rdquo; and all, for life and death, came splash upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried the father, putting one hand to his ear, while
      with the other he pointed to a chair; and as Mrs. Morton looked up from
      the preserves with that air of indignant suffering with which female
      meekness upbraids a husband&rsquo;s wanton outrage, Mr. Roger added, shrugging
      his shoulders,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My nephews again, Mrs. K!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Margaret turned round, and dropped a courtesy. Mrs. Morton gently let
      fall a napkin over the preserves, and muttered a sort of salutation, as
      the stranger, taking off his hat, turned to mother and daughter one of
      those noble faces in which Nature has written her grant and warranty of
      the lordship of creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I disturb you. But my business will be short. I
      have come to ask you, sir, frankly, and as one who has a right to ask it,
      what tidings you can give me of Sidney Morton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I know nothing whatever about him. He was taken from my house, about
      twelve years since, by his brother. Myself, and the two Mr. Beauforts, and
      another friend of the family, went in search of them both. My search
      failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And theirs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood from Mr. Beaufort that they had not been more successful. I
      have had no communication with those gentlemen since. But that&rsquo;s neither
      here nor there. In all probability, the elder of the boys&mdash;who, I
      fear, was a sad character&mdash;corrupted and ruined his brother; and, by
      this time, Heaven knows what and where they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one has inquired of you since&mdash;no one has asked the brother
      of Catherine Morton, nay, rather of Catherine Beaufort&mdash;where is the
      child intrusted to your care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question, so exactly similar to that which his superstition had rung
      on his own ears, perfectly appalled the worthy alderman. He staggered
      back-stared at the marked and stern face that lowered upon him&mdash;and
      at last cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, sir, be just! What could I do for one who left me of his
      own accord?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day you had beaten him like a dog. You see, Mr. Morton, I know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you?&rdquo; said Mr. Morton, recovering his English courage, and
      feeling himself strangely browbeaten in his own house;&mdash;&ldquo;What and who
      are you, that you thus take the liberty to catechise a man of my character
      and respectability?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice mayor&mdash;&rdquo; began Mrs. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, mother!&rdquo; whispered Miss Margaret,&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t work him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I repeat, sir, what are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I?&mdash;your nephew! Who am I? Before men, I bear a name that I
      have assumed, and not dishonoured&mdash;before Heaven I am Philip
      Beaufort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton dropped down upon her stool. Margaret murmured &ldquo;My cousin!&rdquo; in
      a tone that the ear of the musical coal-merchant might not have greatly
      relished. And Mr. Morton, after a long pause, came up with a frank and
      manly expression of joy, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, I thank Heaven, from my heart, that one of my sister&rsquo;s
      children stands alive before me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, again, I&mdash;I whom you accuse of having corrupted and ruined
      him&mdash;him for whom I toiled and worked&mdash;him, who was to me, then,
      as a last surviving son to some anxious father&mdash;I, from whom he was
      reft and robbed&mdash;I ask you again for Sidney&mdash;for my brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And again, I say, that I have no information to give you&mdash;that&mdash;Stay
      a moment&mdash;stay. You must pardon what I have said of you before you
      made yourself known. I went but by the accounts I had received from Mr.
      Beaufort. Let me speak plainly; that gentleman thought, right or wrong,
      that it would be a great thing to separate your brother from you. He may
      have found him&mdash;it must be so&mdash;and kept his name and condition
      concealed from us all, lest you should detect it. Mrs. M., don&rsquo;t you think
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m so terrified I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton,
      putting her hand to her forehead, and see-sawing herself to and fro upon
      her stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But since they wronged you&mdash;since you&mdash;you seem so very&mdash;very&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much the gentleman,&rdquo; suggested Miss Margaret. &ldquo;Yes, so much the
      gentleman;&mdash;well off, too, I should hope, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;and the
      experienced eye of Mr. Morton glanced at the costly sables that lined the
      pelisse,&mdash;&ldquo;there can be no difficulty in your learning from Mr.
      Beaufort all that you wish to know. And pray, sir, may I ask, did you send
      any one here to-day to make the very inquiry you have made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&mdash;No. What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well&mdash;sit down&mdash;there may be something in all this that
      you may make out better than I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Philip obeyed, Mr. Morton, who was really and honestly rejoiced to
      see his sister&rsquo;s son alive and apparently thriving, proceeded to relate
      pretty exactly the conversation he had held with the previous visitor.
      Philip listened earnestly and with attention. Who could this questioner
      be? Some one who knew his birth&mdash;some one who sought him out?&mdash;some
      one, who&mdash;Good Heavens! could it be the long-lost witness of the
      marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as that idea struck him, he started from his seat and entreated
      Morton to accompany him in search of the stranger. &ldquo;You know not,&rdquo; he
      said, in a tone impressed with that energy of will in which lay the talent
      of his mind,&mdash;&ldquo;you know not of what importance this may be to my
      prospects&mdash;to your sister&rsquo;s fair name. If it should be the witness
      returned at last! Who else, of the rank you describe, would be interested
      in such inquiries? Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What witness?&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton, fretfully. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to come over
      us with the old story of the marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall your wife slander your own sister, sir? A marriage there was&mdash;God
      yet will proclaim the right&mdash;and the name of Beaufort shall be yet
      placed on my mother&rsquo;s gravestone. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your shoes and umbrella, pa,&rdquo; cried Miss Margaret, inspired by
      Philip&rsquo;s earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fair cousin, I guess,&rdquo; and as the soldier took her hand, he kissed the
      unreluctant cheek&mdash;turned to the door&mdash;Mr. Morton placed his arm
      in his, and the next moment they were in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Catherine, in her meek tones, had said, &ldquo;Philip Beaufort was my
      husband,&rdquo; Roger Morton had disbelieved her. And now one word from the son,
      who could, in comparison, know so little of the matter, had almost
      sufficed to convert and to convince the sceptic. Why was this? Because&mdash;Man
      believes the Strong!

</pre>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the object of their search, on quitting Mr. Morton&rsquo;s shop, had
      walked slowly and sadly on, through the plashing streets, till he came to
      a public house in the outskirts and on the high road to London. Here he
      took shelter for a short time, drying himself by the kitchen fire, with
      the license purchased by fourpenny-worth of gin; and having learned that
      the next coach to London would not pass for some hours, he finally settled
      himself in the Ingle, till the guard&rsquo;s horn should arouse him. By the same
      coach that the night before had conveyed Philip to N&mdash;&mdash;, had
      the very man he sought been also a passenger!
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow was sickly and wearied out: he had settled into a doze,
      when he was suddenly wakened by the wheels of a coach and the trampling of
      horses. Not knowing how long he had slept, and imagining that the vehicle
      he had awaited was at the door, he ran out. It was a coach coming from
      London, and the driver was joking with a pretty barmaid who, in rather
      short petticoats, was fielding up to him the customary glass. The man,
      after satisfying himself that his time was not yet come, was turning back
      to the fire, when a head popped itself out of the window, and a voice
      cried, &ldquo;Stars and garters! Will&mdash;so that&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; At the sound of the
      voice the man halted abruptly, turned very pale, and his limbs trembled.
      The inside passenger opened the door, jumped out with a little carpet-bag
      in his hand, took forth a long leathern purse from which he ostentatiously
      selected the coins that paid his fare and satisfied the coachman, and
      then, passing his arm through that of the acquaintance he had discovered,
      led him back into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will&mdash;Will,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you have been to the Mortons. Never
      moind&mdash;let&rsquo;s hear all. Jenny or Dolly, or whatever your sweet praetty
      name is&mdash;a private room and a pint of brandy, my dear. Hot water and
      lots of the grocery. That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as soon as the pair found themselves, with the brandy before them, in
      a small parlour with a good fire, the last comer went to the door, shut it
      cautiously, flung his bag under the table, took off his gloves, spread
      himself wider and wider before the fire, until he had entirely excluded
      every ray from his friend, and then suddenly turning so that the back
      might enjoy what the front had gained, he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damme, Will, you&rsquo;re a praetty sort of a broather to give me the slip in
      that way. But in this world every man for his-self!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said William, with something like decision in his voice,
      &ldquo;that I will not do any wrong to these young men if they live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who asks you to do a wrong to them?&mdash;booby! Perhaps I may be the
      best friend they may have yet&mdash;ay, or you too, though you&rsquo;re the
      ungratefulest whimsicallist sort of a son of a gun that ever I came
      across. Come, help yourself, and don&rsquo;t roll up your eyes in that way, like
      a Muggletonian asoide of a Fye-Fye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the speaker paused a moment, and with a graver and more natural tone
      of voice proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you did not believe me when I told you that these brothers were dead,
      and you have been to the Mortons to learn more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what have you learned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Morton declares that he does not know that they are alive, but
      he says also that he does not know that they are dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the other, listening with great attention; &ldquo;and you really
      think that he does not know anything about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Is he a sort of man who would post down the rhino to help the
      search?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked as if he had the yellow fever when I said I was poor,&rdquo; returned
      William, turning round, and trying to catch a glimpse at the fire, as he
      gulped his brandy and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be d&mdash;-d if I run the risk of calling. I have done some
      things in this town by way of business before now; and though it&rsquo;s a long
      time ago, yet folks don&rsquo;t forget a haundsome man in a hurry&mdash;especially
      if he has done &lsquo;em! Now, then, listen to me. You see, I have given this
      matter all the &lsquo;tention in my power. &lsquo;If the lads be dead,&rsquo; said I to you,
      &lsquo;it is no use burning one&rsquo;s fingers by holding a candle to bones in a
      coffin. But Mr. Beaufort need not know they are dead, and we&rsquo;ll see what
      we can get out of him; and if I succeeds, as I think I shall, you and I
      may hold up our heads for the rest of our life.&rsquo; Accordingly, as I told
      you, I went to Mr. Beaufort, and&mdash;&lsquo;Gad, I thought we had it all our
      own way. But since I saw you last, there&rsquo;s been the devil and all. When I
      called again, Will, I was shown in to an old lord, sharp as a gimblet.
      Hang me, William, if he did not frighten me out of my seven senses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Captain Smith (the reader has, no doubt, already discovered that the
      speaker was no less a personage) took three or four nervous strides across
      the room, returned to the table, threw himself in a chair, placed one foot
      on one hob, and one on the other, laid his finger on his nose, and, with a
      significant wink, said in a whisper, &ldquo;Will, he knew I had been lagged! He
      not only refused to hear all I had to say, but threatened to prosecute&mdash;persecute,
      hang, draw, and quarter us both, if we ever dared to come out with the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the good of the truth if the boys are dead?&rdquo; said William,
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, without heeding this question, continued, as he stirred the
      sugar in his glass, &ldquo;Well, out I sneaked, and as soon as I had got to my
      own door I turned round and saw Sharp the runner on the other side of the
      way&mdash;I felt deuced queer. However, I went in, sat down, and began to
      think. I saw that it was up with us, so far as the old uns were concerned;
      and it might be worth while to find out if the young uns really were
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you did not know that after all! I thought so. Oh, Jerry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, look you, man, it was not our interest to take their side if we
      could make our bargain out of the other. &lsquo;Cause why? You are only one
      witness&mdash;you are a good fellow, but poor, and with very shaky nerves,
      Will. You does not know what them big wigs are when a man&rsquo;s caged in a
      witness-box&mdash;they flank one up, and they flank one down, and they
      bully and bother, till one&rsquo;s like a horse at Astley&rsquo;s dancing on hot iron.
      If your testimony broke down, why it would be all up with the case, and
      what then would become of us? Besides,&rdquo; added the captain, with dignified
      candour, &ldquo;I have been lagged, it&rsquo;s no use denying it; I am back before my
      time. Inquiries about your respectability would soon bring the bulkies
      about me. And you would not have poor Jerry sent back to that d&mdash;-d
      low place on t&rsquo;other side of the herring-pond, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Jerry!&rdquo; said William, kindly placing his hand in his brother&rsquo;s, &ldquo;you
      know I helped you to escape; I left all to come over with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you did, and you&rsquo;re a good fellow; though as to leaving all, why you
      had got rid of all first. And when you told me about the marriage, did not
      I say that I saw our way to a snug thing for life? But to return to my
      story. There is a danger in going with the youngsters. But since, Will,&mdash;since
      nothing but hard words is to be got on the other side, we&rsquo;ll do our duty,
      and I&rsquo;ll find them out, and do the best I can for us&mdash;that is, if
      they be yet above ground. And now I&rsquo;ll own to you that I think I knows
      that the younger one is alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! But as he won&rsquo;t come in for anything unless his brother is dead, we
      must have a hunt for the heir. Now I told you that, many years ago, there
      was a lad with me, who, putting all things together&mdash;seeing how the
      Beauforts came after him, and recollecting different things he let out at
      the time&mdash;I feel pretty sure is your old master&rsquo;s Hopeful. I know
      that poor Will Gawtrey gave this lad the address of Old Gregg, a friend of
      mine. So after watching Sharp off the sly, I went that very night, or
      rather at two in the morning, to Gregg&rsquo;s house, and, after brushing up his
      memory, I found that the lad had been to him, and gone over afterwards to
      Paris in search of Gawtrey, who was then keeping a matrimony shop. As I
      was not rich enough to go off to Paris in a pleasant, gentlemanlike way, I
      allowed Gregg to put me up to a noice quiet little bit of business. Don&rsquo;t
      shake your head&mdash;all safe&mdash;a rural affair! That took some days.
      You see it has helped to new rig me,&rdquo; and the captain glanced complacently
      over a very smart suit of clothes. &ldquo;Well, on my return I went to call on
      you, but you had flown. I half suspected you might have gone to the
      mother&rsquo;s relations here; and I thought, at all events, that I could not do
      better than go myself and see what they knew of the matter. From what you
      say I feel I had better now let that alone, and go over to Paris at once;
      leave me alone to find out. And faith, what with Sharp and the old lord,
      the sooner I quit England the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really think you shall get hold of them after all? Oh, never fear
      my nerves if I&rsquo;m once in the right; it&rsquo;s living with you, and seeing you
      do wrong, and hearing you talk wickedly, that makes me tremble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother!&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;you need not crow over me. Stand up, Will;
      there now, look at us two in the glass! Why, I look ten years younger than
      you do, in spite of all my troubles. I dress like a gentleman, as I am; I
      have money in my pocket; I put money in yours; without me you&rsquo;d starve.
      Look you, you carried over a little fortune to Australia&mdash;you married&mdash;you
      farmed&mdash;you lived honestly, and yet that d&mdash;-d shilly-shally
      disposition of yours, &lsquo;ticed into one speculation to-day, and scared out
      of another to-morrow, ruined you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry! Jerry!&rdquo; cried William, writhing; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all true, and I wants to cure you of preaching. And then, when
      you were nearly run out, instead of putting a bold face on it, and setting
      your shoulder to the wheel, you gives it up&mdash;you sells what you have&mdash;you
      bolts over, wife and all, to Boston, because some one tells you you can do
      better in America&mdash;you are out of the way when a search is made for
      you&mdash;years ago when you could have benefited yourself and your
      master&rsquo;s family without any danger to you or me&mdash;nobody can find you;
      &lsquo;cause why, you could not bear that your old friends in England, or in the
      colony either, should know that you were turned a slave-driver in
      Kentucky. You kick up a mutiny among the niggers by moaning over them,
      instead of keeping &lsquo;em to it&mdash;you get kicked out yourself&mdash;your
      wife begs you to go back to Australia, where her relations will do
      something for you&mdash;you work your passage out, looking as ragged as a
      colt from grass&mdash;wife&rsquo;s uncle don&rsquo;t like ragged nephews-in-law&mdash;wife
      dies broken-hearted&mdash;and you might be breaking stones on the roads
      with the convicts, if I, myself a convict, had not taken compassion on
      you. Don&rsquo;t cry, Will, it is all for your own good&mdash;I hates cant!
      Whereas I, my own master from eighteen, never stooped to serve any other&mdash;have
      dressed like a gentleman&mdash;kissed the pretty girls&mdash;drove my
      pheaton&mdash;been in all the papers as &lsquo;the celebrated Dashing Jerry&rsquo;&mdash;never
      wanted a guinea in my pocket, and even when lagged at last, had a pretty
      little sum in the colonial bank to lighten my misfortunes. I escape,&mdash;I
      bring you over&mdash;and here I am, supporting you, and in all
      probability, the one on whom depends the fate of one of the first families
      in the country. And you preaches at me, do you? Look you, Will;&mdash;in
      this world, honesty&rsquo;s nothing without force of character! And so your
      health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the captain emptied the rest of the brandy into his glass, drained it
      at a draught, and, while poor William was wiping his eyes with a ragged
      blue pocket-handkerchief, rang the bell, and asked what coaches would pass
      that way to &mdash;&mdash;-, a seaport town at some distance. On hearing
      that there was one at six o&rsquo;clock, the captain ordered the best dinner the
      larder would afford to be got ready as soon as possible; and, when they
      were again alone, thus accosted his brother:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you go back to town&mdash;here are four shiners for you. Keep quiet&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      speak to a soul&mdash;don&rsquo;t put your foot in it, that&rsquo;s all I beg, and
      I&rsquo;ll find out whatever there is to be found. It is damnably out of my way
      embarking at &mdash;&mdash;-, but I had best keep clear of Lunnon. And I
      tell you what, if these youngsters have hopped the twig, there&rsquo;s another
      bird on the bough that may prove a goldfinch after all&mdash;Young Arthur
      Beaufort: I hear he is a wild, expensive chap, and one who can&rsquo;t live
      without lots of money. Now, it&rsquo;s easy to frighten a man of that sort, and
      I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have the old lord at his elbow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you, that I only care for my poor master&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but if they are dead, and by saying they are alive, one can make old
      age comfortable, there&rsquo;s no harm in it&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said William, irresolutely. &ldquo;But certainly it is a hard
      thing to be so poor at my time of life; and so honest a man as I&rsquo;ve been,
      too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Smith went a little too far when he said that &ldquo;honesty&rsquo;s nothing
      without force of character.&rdquo; Still, Honesty has no business to be helpless
      and draggle-tailed;&mdash;she must be active and brisk, and make use of
      her wits; or, though she keep clear or the prison, &lsquo;tis no very great
      wonder if she fall on the parish.

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Mitis.&mdash;This Macilente, signior, begins to be more sociable on
     a sudden.&rdquo; Every Man out of his Humour.

     &ldquo;Punt. Signior, you are sufficiently instructed.

     &ldquo;Fast. Who, I, sir?&rdquo;&mdash;Ibid.
</pre>
    <p>
      After spending the greater part of the day in vain inquiries and a vain
      search, Philip and Mr. Morton returned to the house of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;all that remains to be done is this: first give
      to the police of the town a detailed description of the man; and secondly,
      let us put an advertisement both in the county journal and in some of the
      London papers, to the effect, that if the person who called on you will
      take the trouble to apply again, either personally or by letter, he may
      obtain the information sought for. In case he does, I will trouble you to
      direct him to&mdash;yes&mdash;to Monsieur de Vaudemont, according to this
      address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same thing,&rdquo; replied Philip, drily. &ldquo;You have confirmed my
      suspicions, that the Beauforts know some thing of my brother. What did you
      say of some other friend of the family who assisted in the search?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&mdash;a Mr. Spencer! an old acquaintance of your mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Here Mr.
      Morton smiled, but not being encouraged in a joke, went on, &ldquo;However,
      that&rsquo;s neither here nor there; he certainly never found out your brother.
      For I have had several letters from him at different times, asking if any
      news had been heard of either of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, Spencer had taken peculiar pains to deceive the Mortons,
      whose interposition he feared little less than that of the Beauforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it can be of no use to apply to him,&rdquo; said Philip, carelessly, not
      having any recollection of the name of Spencer, and therefore attaching
      little importance to the mention of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I should think not. Depend on it, Mr. Beaufort must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;And I have only to thank you for your kindness, and
      return to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But stay with us this day&mdash;do&mdash;let me feel that we are friends.
      I assure you poor Sidney&rsquo;s fate has been a load on my mind ever since he
      left. You shall have the bed he slept in, and over which your mother bent
      when she left him and me for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were said with so much feeling, that the adventurer wrung his
      uncle&rsquo;s hand, and said, &ldquo;Forgive me, I wronged you&mdash;I will be your
      guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morton, strange to say, evinced no symptoms of ill-humour at the news
      of the proffered hospitality. In fact, Miss Margaret had been so eloquent
      in Philip&rsquo;s praise during his absence, that she suffered herself to be
      favourably impressed. Her daughter, indeed, had obtained a sort of
      ascendency over Mrs. M. and the whole house, ever since she had received
      so excellent an offer. And, moreover, some people are like dogs&mdash;they
      snarl at the ragged and fawn on the well-dressed. Mrs. Morton did not
      object to a nephew de facto, she only objected to a nephew in forma
      pauperis. The evening, therefore, passed more cheerfully than might have
      been anticipated, though Philip found some difficulty in parrying the many
      questions put to him on the past. He contented himself with saying, as
      briefly as possible, that he had served in a foreign service, and acquired
      what sufficed him for an independence; and then, with the ease which a man
      picks up in the great world, turned the conversation to the prospects of
      the family whose guest he was. Having listened with due attention to Mrs.
      Morton&rsquo;s eulogies on Tom, who had been sent for, and who drank the praises
      on his own gentility into a very large pair of blushing ears,&mdash;also,
      to her self-felicitations on Miss Margaret&rsquo;s marriage,&mdash;item, on the
      service rendered to the town by Mr. Roger, who had repaired the town-hall
      in his first mayoralty at his own expense,&mdash;item, to a long chronicle
      of her own genealogy, how she had one cousin a clergyman, and how her
      great-grandfather had been knighted,&mdash;item, to the domestic virtues
      of all her children,&mdash;item, to a confused explanation of the
      chastisement inflicted on Sidney, which Philip cut short in the middle; he
      asked, with a smile, what had become of the Plaskwiths. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Morton, &ldquo;my brother Kit has retired from business. His son-in-law, Mr.
      Plimmins, has succeeded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, Plimmins married one of the young ladies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jane&mdash;she had a sad squint!&mdash;Tom, there is nothing to
      laugh at,&mdash;we are all as God made us,&mdash;&lsquo;Handsome is as handsome
      does,&rsquo;&mdash;she has had three little uns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they squint too?&rdquo; asked Philip; and Miss Margaret giggled, and Tom
      roared, and the other young men roared too. Philip had certainly said
      something very witty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Mrs. Morton administered no reproof; but replied pensively
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natur is very mysterious&mdash;they all squint!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Morton conducted Philip to his chamber. There it was, fresh, clean,
      unaltered&mdash;the same white curtains, the same honeysuckle paper as
      when Catherine had crept across the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Sidney ever tell you that his mother placed a ring round his neck
      that night?&rdquo; asked Mr. Morton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the dear boy wept when he said that he had slept too soundly to
      know that she was by his side that last, last time. The ring&mdash;oh, how
      well I remember it! she never put it off till then; and often in the
      fields&mdash;for we were wild wanderers together in that day&mdash;often
      when his head lay on my shoulder, I felt that ring still resting on his
      heart, and fancied it was a talisman&mdash;a blessing. Well, well-good
      night to you!&rdquo; And he shut the door on his uncle, and was alone.

      CHAPTER IV.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;The Man of Law,.......
        And a great suit is like to be between them.&rdquo;
         BEN JONSON: Staple of News.
</pre>
    <p>
      On arriving in London, Philip went first to the lodging he still kept
      there, and to which his letters were directed; and, among some
      communications from Paris, full of the politics and the hopes of the
      Carlists, he found the following note from Lord Lilburne:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR,&mdash;When I met you the other day I told you I had been
      threatened with the gout. The enemy has now taken possession of the field.
      I am sentenced to regimen and the sofa. But as it is my rule in life to
      make afflictions as light as possible, so I have asked a few friends to
      take compassion on me, and help me &lsquo;to shuffle off this mortal coil&rsquo; by
      dealing me, if they can, four by honours. Any time between nine and twelve
      to-night, or to-morrow night, you will find me at home; and if you are not
      better engaged, suppose you dine with me to-day&mdash;or rather dine
      opposite to me&mdash;and excuse my Spartan broth. You will meet (besides
      any two or three friends whom an impromptu invitation may find disengaged)
      my sister, with Beaufort and their daughter: they only arrived in town
      this morning, and are kind enough &lsquo;to nurse me,&rsquo; as they call it,&mdash;that
      is to say, their cook is taken ill!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                   &ldquo;Yours,

                      &ldquo;LILBURNE
&ldquo;Park Lane, Sept. &mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Beauforts. Fate favors me&mdash;I will go. The date is for to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent off a hasty line to accept the invitation, and finding he had a
      few hours yet to spare, he resolved to employ them in consultation with
      some lawyer as to the chances of ultimately regaining his inheritance&mdash;a
      hope which, however wild, he had, since his return to his native shore,
      and especially since he had heard of the strange visit made to Roger
      Morton, permitted himself to indulge. With this idea he sallied out,
      meaning to consult Liancourt, who, having a large acquaintance among the
      English, seemed the best person to advise him as to the choice of a lawyer
      at once active and honest,&mdash;when he suddenly chanced upon that
      gentleman himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is lucky, my dear Liancourt. I was just going to your lodgings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was coming to yours to know if you dine with Lord Lilburne. He told
      me he had asked you. I have just left him. And, by the sofa of
      Mephistopheles, there was the prettiest Margaret you ever beheld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called her his niece; but I should doubt if he had any relation on
      this side the Styx so human as a niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have no great predilection for our host.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Vaudemont, between our blunt, soldierly natures, and those wily,
      icy, sneering intellects, there is the antipathy of the dog to the cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so on our side, not on his&mdash;or why does he invite us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London is empty; there is no one else to ask. We are new faces, new minds
      to him. We amuse him more than the hackneyed comrades he has worn out.
      Besides, he plays&mdash;and you, too. Fie on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Liancourt, I had two objects in knowing that man, and I pay to the toll
      for the bridge. When I cease to want the passage, I shall cease to pay the
      toll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the bridge may be a draw-bridge, and the moat is devilish deep below.
      Without metaphor, that man may ruin you before you know where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! I have my eyes open. I know how much to spend on the rogue whose
      service I hire as a lackey&rsquo;s; and I know also where to stop. Liancourt,&rdquo;
       he added, after a short pause, and in a tone deep with suppressed passion,
      &ldquo;when I first saw that man, I thought of appealing to his heart for one
      who has a claim on it. That was a vain hope. And then there came upon me a
      sterner and deadlier thought&mdash;the scheme of the Avenger! This
      Lilburne&mdash;this rogue whom the world sets up to worship&mdash;ruined,
      body and soul ruined&mdash;one whose name the world gibbets with scorn!
      Well, I thought to avenge that man. In his own house&mdash;amidst you all&mdash;I
      thought to detect the sharper, and brand the cheat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You startle me!&mdash;It has been whispered, indeed, that Lord Lilburne
      is dangerous,&mdash;but skill is dangerous. To cheat!&mdash;an Englishman!&mdash;a
      nobleman!&mdash;impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether he do or not,&rdquo; returned Vaudemont, in a calmer tone, &ldquo;I have
      foregone the vengeance, because he is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said Vaudemont aloud, but he added to himself,&mdash;&ldquo;Because
      he is the grandfather of Fanny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very enigmatical to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, Liancourt; I may solve all the riddles that make up my life,
      yet. Bear with me a little longer. And now can you help me to a lawyer?&mdash;a
      man experienced, indeed, and of repute, but young, active, not overladen
      with business;&mdash;I want his zeal and his time, for a hazard that your
      monopolists of clients may not deem worth their devotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can recommend you, then, the very man you require. I had a suit some
      years ago at Paris, for which English witnesses were necessary. My avocat
      employed a solicitor here whose activity in collecting my evidence gained
      my cause. I will answer for his diligence and his honesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Barlow&mdash;somewhere by the Strand&mdash;let me see&mdash;Essex-yes,
      Essex Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then good-bye to you for the present.&mdash;You dine at Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s
      too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Adieu till then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont was not long before he arrived at Mr. Barlow&rsquo;s; a brass-plate
      announced to him the house. He was shown at once into a parlour, where he
      saw a man whom lawyers would call young, and spinsters middle-aged&mdash;viz.,
      about two-and-forty; with a bold, resolute, intelligent countenance, and
      that steady, calm, sagacious eye, which inspires at once confidence and
      esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont scanned him with the look of one who has been accustomed to
      judge mankind&mdash;as a scholar does books&mdash;with rapidity because
      with practice. He had at first resolved to submit to him the heads of his
      case without mentioning names, and, in fact, he so commenced his
      narrative; but by degrees, as he perceived how much his own earnestness
      arrested and engrossed the interest of his listener, he warmed into fuller
      confidence, and ended by a full disclosure, and a caution as to the
      profoundest secrecy in case, if there were no hope to recover his rightful
      name, he might yet wish to retain, unannoyed by curiosity or suspicion,
      that by which he was not discreditably known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Barlow, after assuring him of the most scrupulous
      discretion,&mdash;&ldquo;sir, I have some recollection of the trial instituted
      by your mother, Mrs. Beaufort&rdquo;&mdash;and the slight emphasis he laid on
      that name was the most grateful compliment he could have paid to the truth
      of Philip&rsquo;s recital. &ldquo;My impression is, that it was managed in a very
      slovenly manner by her lawyer; and some of his oversights we may repair in
      a suit instituted by yourself. But it would be absurd to conceal from you
      the great difficulties that beset us&mdash;your mother&rsquo;s suit, designed to
      establish her own rights, was far easier than that which you must commence&mdash;viz.,
      an action for ejectment against a man who has been some years in
      undisturbed possession. Of course, until the missing witness is found out,
      it would be madness to commence litigation. And the question, then, will
      be, how far that witness will suffice? It is true, that one witness of a
      marriage, if the others are dead, is held sufficient by law. But I need
      not add, that that witness must be thoroughly credible. In suits for real
      property, very little documentary or secondary evidence is admitted. I
      doubt even whether the certificate of the marriage on which&mdash;in the
      loss or destruction of the register&mdash;you lay so much stress, would be
      available in itself. But if an examined copy, it becomes of the last
      importance, for it will then inform us of the name of the person who
      extracted and examined it. Heaven grant it may not have been the clergyman
      himself who performed the ceremony, and who, you say, is dead; if some one
      else, we should then have a second, no doubt credible and most valuable
      witness. The document would thus become available as proof, and, I think,
      that we should not fail to establish our case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this certificate, how is it ever to be found? I told you we had
      searched everywhere in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; but you say that your mother always declared that the late Mr.
      Beaufort had so solemnly assured her, even just prior to his decease, that
      it was in existence, that I have no doubt as to the fact. It may be
      possible, but it is a terrible insinuation to make, that if Mr. Robert
      Beaufort, in examining the papers of the deceased, chanced upon a document
      so important to him, he abstracted or destroyed it. If this should not
      have been the case (and Mr. Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s moral character is unspotted&mdash;and
      we have no right to suppose it), the probability is, either that it was
      intrusted to some third person, or placed in some hidden drawer or
      deposit, the secret of which your father never disclosed. Who has
      purchased the house you lived in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fernside? Lord Lilburne. Mrs. Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph&mdash;probably, then, he took the furniture and all. Sir, this is a
      matter that requires some time for close consideration. With your leave, I
      will not only insert in the London papers an advertisement to the effect
      that you suggested to Mr. Roger Morton (in case you should have made a
      right conjecture as to the object of the man who applied to him), but I
      will also advertise for the witness himself. William Smith, you say, his
      name is. Did the lawyer employed by Mrs. Beaufort send to inquire for him
      in the colony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I fear there could not have been time for that. My mother was so
      anxious and eager, and so convinced of the justice of her case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity; her lawyer must have been a sad driveller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, now I remember, inquiry was made of his relations in England.
      His father, a farmer, was then alive; the answer was that he had certainly
      left Australia. His last letter, written two years before that date,
      containing a request for money, which the father, himself made a bankrupt
      by reverses, could not give, had stated that he was about to seek his
      fortune elsewhere&mdash;since then they had heard nothing of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem! Well, you will perhaps let me know where any relations of his are
      yet to be found, and I will look up the former suit, and go into the whole
      case without delay. In the meantime, you do right, sir&mdash;if you will
      allow me to say it&mdash;not to disclose either your own identity or a
      hint of your intentions. It is no use putting suspicion on its guard. And
      my search for this certificate must be managed with the greatest address.
      But, by the way&mdash;speaking of identity&mdash;there can be no
      difficulty, I hope, in proving yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was startled. &ldquo;Why, I am greatly altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But probably your beard and moustache may contribute to that change; and
      doubtless, in the village where you lived, there would be many with whom
      you were in sufficient intercourse, and on whose recollection, by
      recalling little anecdotes and circumstances with which no one but
      yourself could be acquainted, your features would force themselves along
      with the moral conviction that the man who spoke to them could be no other
      but Philip Morton&mdash;or rather Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; there must be many such. There was not a cottage in the
      place where I and my dogs were not familiar and half domesticated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s right, so far, then. But I repeat, we must not be too sanguine. Law
      is not justice&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But God is,&rdquo; said Philip; and he left the room.

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Volpone. A little in a mist, but not dejected;
     Never&mdash;but still myself.&rdquo;
                BEN JONSON: Volpone.

     &ldquo;Peregrine. Am I enough disguised?
     Mer. Ay. I warrant you.
     Per. Save you, fair lady.&rdquo;&mdash;Ibid.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is an ill wind that blows nobody good. The ill wind that had blown gout
      to Lord Lilburne had blown Lord Lilburne away from the injury he had
      meditated against what he called &ldquo;the object of his attachment.&rdquo; How
      completely and entirely, indeed, the state of Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s feelings
      depended on the state of his health, may be seen in the answer he gave to
      his valet, when, the morning after the first attack of the gout, that
      worthy person, by way of cheering his master, proposed to ascertain
      something as to the movements of one with whom Lord Lilburne professed to
      be so violently in love,&mdash;&ldquo;Confound you, Dykeman!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      invalid,&mdash;&ldquo;why do you trouble me about women when I&rsquo;m in this
      condition? I don&rsquo;t care if they were all at the bottom of the sea! Reach
      me the colchicum! I must keep my mind calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever tolerably well, Lord Lilburne was careless of his health; the
      moment he was ill, Lord Lilburne paid himself the greatest possible
      attention. Though a man of firm nerves, in youth of remarkable daring, and
      still, though no longer rash, of sufficient personal courage, he was by no
      means fond of the thought of death&mdash;that is, of his own death. Not
      that he was tormented by any religious apprehensions of the Dread Unknown,
      but simply because the only life of which he had any experience seemed to
      him a peculiarly pleasant thing. He had a sort of instinctive persuasion
      that John Lord Lilburne would not be better off anywhere else. Always
      disliking solitude, he disliked it more than ever when he was ill, and he
      therefore welcomed the visit of his sister and the gentle hand of his
      pretty niece. As for Beaufort, he bored the sufferer; and when that
      gentleman, on his arrival, shutting out his wife and daughter, whispered
      to Lilburne, &ldquo;Any more news of that impostor?&rdquo; Lilburne answered
      peevishly, &ldquo;I never talk about business when I have the gout! I have set
      Sharp to keep a lookout for him, but he has learned nothing as yet. And
      now go to your club. You are a worthy creature, but too solemn for my
      spirits just at this moment. I have a few people coming to dine with me,
      your wife will do the honors, and&mdash;you can come in the evening.&rdquo;
       Though Mr. Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s sense of importance swelled and chafed at
      this very unceremonious conge, he forced a smile, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is no wonder you are a little fretful with the gout. I have
      plenty to do in town, and Mrs. Beaufort and Camilla can come back without
      waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as your cook is ill, and they can&rsquo;t dine at a club, you may as well
      leave them here till I am a little better; not that I care, for I can hire
      a better nurse than either of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Lilburne, don&rsquo;t talk of hiring nurses; certainly, I am too happy
      if they can be of comfort to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! on second thoughts, you may take back your wife, she&rsquo;s always talking
      of her own complaints, and leave me Camilla: you can&rsquo;t want her for a few
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you like. And you really think I have managed as well as I could
      about this young man,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes! And so you go to Beaufort Court in a few days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I propose doing so. I wish you were well enough to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um! Chambers says that it would be a very good air for me&mdash;better
      than Fernside; and as to my castle in the north, I would as soon go to
      Siberia. Well, if I get better, I will pay you a visit, only you always
      have such a stupid set of respectable people about you. I shock them, and
      they oppress me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as I hope soon to see Arthur, I shall make it as agreeable to him as
      I can, and I shall be very much obliged to you if you would invite a few
      of your own friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are a good fellow, Beaufort, and I will take you at your word;
      and, since one good turn deserves another, I have now no scruples in
      telling you that I feel quite sure that you will have no further annoyance
      from this troublesome witness-monger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Beaufort, &ldquo;I may pick up a better match for Camilla!
      Good-bye, my dear Lilburne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Form and Ceremony of the world!&rdquo; snarled the peer, as the door closed on
      his brother-in-law, &ldquo;ye make little men very moral, and not a bit the
      better for being so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Vaudemont arrived before any of the other guests that
      day, and during the half hour which Dr. Chambers assigned to his
      illustrious patient, so that, when he entered, there were only Mrs.
      Beaufort and Camilla in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont drew back involuntarily as he recognized in the faded
      countenance of the elder lady, features associated with one of the dark
      passages in his earlier life; but Mrs. Beaufort&rsquo;s gracious smile, and
      urbane, though languid welcome, sufficed to assure him that the
      recognition was not mutual. He advanced, and again stopped short, as his
      eye fell upon that fair and still childlike form, which had once knelt by
      his side and pleaded, with the orphan, for his brother. While he spoke to
      her, many recollections, some dark and stern&mdash;but those, at least,
      connected with Camilla, soft and gentle&mdash;thrilled through his heart.
      Occupied as her own thoughts and feelings necessarily were with Sidney,
      there was something in Vaudemont&rsquo;s appearance&mdash;his manner, his voice&mdash;which
      forced upon Camilla a strange and undefined interest; and even Mrs.
      Beaufort was roused from her customary apathy, as she glanced at that dark
      and commanding face with something between admiration and fear. Vaudemont
      had scarcely, however, spoken ten words, when some other guests were
      announced, and Lord Lilburne was wheeled in upon his sofa shortly
      afterwards. Vaudemont continued, however, seated next to Camilla, and the
      embarrassment he had at first felt disappeared. He possessed, when he
      pleased, that kind of eloquence which belongs to men who have seen much
      and felt deeply, and whose talk has not been frittered down to the
      commonplace jargon of the world. His very phraseology was distinct and
      peculiar, and he had that rarest of all charms in polished life,
      originality both of thought and of manner. Camilla blushed, when she found
      at dinner that he placed himself by her side. That evening De Vaudemont
      excused himself from playing, but the table was easily made without him,
      and still he continued to converse with the daughter of the man whom he
      held as his worst foe. By degrees, he turned the conversation into a
      channel that might lead him to the knowledge he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my fate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;once to become acquainted with an intimate
      friend of the late Mr. Beaufort. Will you pardon me if I venture to fulfil
      a promise I made to him, and ask you to inform me what has become of a&mdash;a&mdash;that
      is, of Sidney Morton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney Morton! I don&rsquo;t even remember the name. Oh, yes! I have heard it,&rdquo;
       added Camilla, innocently, and with a candour that showed how little she
      knew of the secrets of the family; &ldquo;he was one of two poor boys in whom my
      brother felt a deep interest&mdash;some relations to my uncle. Yes&mdash;yes!
      I remember now. I never knew Sidney, but I once did see his brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! and you remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! I was very young then. I scarcely recollect what passed, it was all
      so confused and strange; but, I know that I made papa very angry, and I
      was told never to mention the name of Morton again. I believe they behaved
      very ill to papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never learned&mdash;never!&mdash;the fate of either&mdash;of
      Sidney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father must know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not; but tell me,&rdquo;&mdash;said Camilla, with girlish and
      unaffected innocence, &ldquo;I have always felt anxious to know,&mdash;what and
      who were those poor boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What and who were they? So deep, then, was the stain upon their name, that
      the modest mother and the decorous father had never even said to that
      young girl, &ldquo;They are your cousins&mdash;the children of the man in whose
      gold we revel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip bit his lip, and the spell of Camilla&rsquo;s presence seemed vanished.
      He muttered some inaudible answer, turned away to the card-table, and
      Liancourt took the chair he had left vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how does Miss Beaufort like my friend Vaudemont? I assure you that I
      have seldom seen him so alive to the fascination of female beauty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Camilla, with her silver laugh, &ldquo;your nation spoils us for our
      own countrymen. You forget how little we are accustomed to flattery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flattery! what truth could flatter on the lips of an exile? But you don&rsquo;t
      answer my question&mdash;what think you of Vaudemont? Few are more
      admired. He is handsome!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; said Camilla, and she glanced at Vaudemont, as he stood at a
      little distance, thoughtful and abstracted. Every girl forms to herself
      some untold dream of that which she considers fairest. And Vaudemont had
      not the delicate and faultless beauty of Sidney. There was nothing that
      corresponded to her ideal in his marked features and lordly shape! But she
      owned, reluctantly to herself, that she had seldom seen, among the trim
      gallants of everyday life, a form so striking and impressive. The air,
      indeed, was professional&mdash;the most careless glance could detect the
      soldier. But it seemed the soldier of an elder age or a wilder clime. He
      recalled to her those heads which she had seen in the Beaufort Gallery and
      other Collections yet more celebrated&mdash;portraits by Titian of those
      warrior statesman who lived in the old Republics of Italy in a perpetual
      struggle with their kind&mdash;images of dark, resolute, earnest men. Even
      whatever was intellectual in his countenance spoke, as in those portraits,
      of a mind sharpened rather in active than in studious life;&mdash;intellectual,
      not from the pale hues, the worn exhaustion, and the sunken cheek of the
      bookman and dreamer, but from its collected and stern repose, the calm
      depth that lay beneath the fire of the eyes, and the strong will that
      spoke in the close full lips, and the high but not cloudless forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as she gazed, Vaudemont turned round&mdash;her eyes fell beneath his,
      and she felt angry with herself that she blushed. Vaudemont saw the
      downcast eye, he saw the blush, and the attraction of Camilla&rsquo;s presence
      was restored. He would have approached her, but at that moment Mr.
      Beaufort himself entered, and his thoughts went again into a darker
      channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Liancourt, &ldquo;you must allow Vaudemont looks what he is&mdash;a
      noble fellow and a gallant soldier. Did you never hear of his battle with
      the tigress? It made a noise in India. I must tell it you as I have heard
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while Laincourt was narrating the adventure, whatever it was, to which
      he referred, the card-table was broken up, and Lord Lilburne, still
      reclining on his sofa, lazily introduced his brother-in-law to such of the
      guests as were strangers to him&mdash;Vaudemont among the rest. Mr.
      Beaufort had never seen Philip Morton more than three times; once at
      Fernside, and the other times by an imperfect light, and when his features
      were convulsed by passion, and his form disfigured by his dress.
      Certainly, therefore, had Robert Beaufort even possessed that faculty of
      memory which is supposed to belong peculiarly to kings and princes, and
      which recalls every face once seen, it might have tasked the gift to the
      utmost to have detected, in the bronzed and decorated foreigner to whom he
      was now presented, the features of the wild and long-lost boy. But still
      some dim and uneasy presentiment, or some struggling and painful effort of
      recollection, was in his mind, as he spoke to Vaudemont, and listened to
      the cold calm tone of his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you say that Frenchman is?&rdquo; he whispered to his brother-in-law, as
      Vaudemont turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a cleverish sort of adventurer&mdash;a gentleman; he plays.&mdash;He
      has seen a good deal of the world&mdash;he rather amuses me&mdash;different
      from other people. I think of asking him to join our circle at Beaufort
      Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort coughed huskily, but not seeing any reasonable objection to
      the proposal, and afraid of rousing the sleeping hyaena of Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s
      sarcasm, he merely said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one you like to invite:&rdquo; and looking round for some one on whom to
      vent his displeasure, perceived Camilla still listening to Liancourt. He
      stalked up to her, and as Liancourt, seeing her rise, rose also and moved
      away, he said peevishly, &ldquo;You will never learn to conduct yourself
      properly; you are to be left here to nurse and comfort your uncle, and not
      to listen to the gibberish of every French adventurer. Well, Heaven be
      praised, I have a son&mdash;girls are a great plague!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are, Mr. Beaufort,&rdquo; sighed his wife, who had just joined him, and
      who was jealous of the preference Lilburne had given to her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so selfish,&rdquo; added Mrs. Beaufort; &ldquo;they only care for their own
      amusements, and never mind how uncomfortable their parents are for want of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dear mamma, don&rsquo;t say so&mdash;let me go home with you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      speak to my uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, child! Come along, Mr. Beaufort;&rdquo; and the affectionate parents
      went out arm in arm. They did not perceive that Vaudemont had been
      standing close behind them; but Camilla, now looking up with tears in her
      eyes, again caught his gaze: he had heard all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they ill-treat her,&rdquo; he muttered: &ldquo;that divides her from them!&mdash;she
      will be left here&mdash;I shall see her again.&rdquo; As he turned to depart,
      Lilburne beckoned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not mean to desert our table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: but I am not very well to-night&mdash;to-morrow, if you will allow
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, to-morrow; and if you can spare an hour in the morning it will be a
      charity. You see,&rdquo; he added in a whisper, &ldquo;I have a nurse, though I have
      no children. D&rsquo;ye think that&rsquo;s love? Bah! sir&mdash;a legacy! Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; said Vaudemont to himself, as he walked through
      the moonlit streets. &ldquo;No! though my heart burns,&mdash;poor murdered
      felon!&mdash;to avenge thy wrongs and thy crimes, revenge cannot come from
      me&mdash;he is Fanny&rsquo;s grandfather and&mdash;Camilla&rsquo;s uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Camilla, when that uncle had dismissed her for the night, sat down
      thoughtfully in her own room. The dark eyes of Vaudemont seemed still to
      shine on her; his voice yet rung in her ear; the wild tales of daring and
      danger with which Liancourt had associated his name yet haunted her
      bewildered fancy&mdash;she started, frightened at her own thoughts. She
      took from her bosom some lines that Sidney had addressed to her, and, as
      she read and re-read, her spirit became calmed to its wonted and faithful
      melancholy. Vaudemont was forgotten, and the name of Sidney yet murmured
      on her lips, when sleep came to renew the image of the absent one, and
      paint in dreams the fairy land of a happy Future!

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Ring on, ye bells&mdash;most pleasant is your chime!&rdquo;
       WILSON. Isle of Palms.

     &ldquo;O fairy child! What can I wish for thee?&rdquo;&mdash;Ibid.
</pre>
    <p>
      Vaudemont remained six days in London without going to H&mdash;&mdash;,
      and on each of those days he paid a visit to Lord Lilburne. On the seventh
      day, the invalid being much better, though still unable to leave his room,
      Camilla returned to Berkeley Square. On the same day, Vaudemont went once
      more to see Simon and poor Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the door, he heard from the window, partially opened, for
      the day was clear and fine, Fanny&rsquo;s sweet voice. She was chaunting one of
      the simple songs she had promised to learn by heart; and Vaudemont, though
      but a poor judge of the art, was struck and affected by the music of the
      voice and the earnest depth of the feeling. He paused opposite the window
      and called her by her name. Fanny looked forth joyously, and ran, as
      usual, to open the door to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you have been so long away; but I already know many of the songs:
      they say so much that I always wanted to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont smiled, but languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange it is,&rdquo; said Fanny, musingly, &ldquo;that there should be so much
      in a piece of paper! for, after all,&rdquo; pointing to the open page of her
      book, &ldquo;this is but a piece of paper&mdash;only there is life in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Vaudemont, gloomily, and far from seizing the subtle delicacy
      of Fanny&rsquo;s thought&mdash;her mind dwelling upon Poetry, and his upon Law,&mdash;&ldquo;ay,
      and do you know that upon a mere scrap of paper, if I could but find it,
      may depend my whole fortune, my whole happiness, all that I care for in
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon a scrap of paper? Oh! how I wish I could find it! Ah! you look as if
      you thought I should never be wise enough for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont, not listening to her, uttered a deep sigh. Fanny approached him
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not sigh, brother,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear to hear you sigh. You are
      changed. Have you, too, not been happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy, Fanny! yes, lately very happy&mdash;too happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy, have you? and I&mdash;&rdquo; the girl stopped short&mdash;her tone had
      been that of sadness and reproach, and she stopped&mdash;why, she knew
      not, but she felt her heart sink within her. Fanny suffered him to pass
      her, and he went straight to his room. Her eyes followed him wistfully: it
      was not his habit to leave her thus abruptly. The family meal of the day
      was over; and it was an hour before Vaudemont descended to the parlour.
      Fanny had put aside the songs; she had no heart to recommence those gentle
      studies that had been so sweet,&mdash;they had drawn no pleasure, no
      praise from him. She was seated idly and listlessly beside the silent old
      man, who every day grew more and more silent still. She turned her head as
      Vaudemont entered, and her pretty lip pouted as that of a neglected child.
      But he did not heed it, and the pout vanished, and tears rushed to her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont was changed. His countenance was thoughtful and overcast. His
      manner abstracted. He addressed a few words to Simon, and then, seating
      himself by the window, leant his cheek on his hand, and was soon lost in
      reverie. Fanny, finding that he did not speak, and after stealing many a
      long and earnest glance at his motionless attitude and gloomy brow, rose
      gently, and gliding to him with her light step, said, in a trembling
      voice,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you in pain, brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, pretty one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why won&rsquo;t you speak to Fanny? Will you not walk with her? Perhaps my
      grandfather will come too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this evening. I shall go out; but it will be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Has not Fanny been good? I have not been out since you left us.
      And the grave&mdash;brother!&mdash;I sent Sarah with the flowers&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont rose abruptly. The mention of the grave brought back his
      thoughts from the dreaming channel into which they had flowed. Fanny,
      whose very childishness had once so soothed him, now disturbed; he felt
      the want of that complete solitude which makes the atmosphere of growing
      passion: he muttered some scarcely audible excuse, and quitted the house.
      Fanny saw him no more that evening. He did not return till midnight. But
      Fanny did not sleep till she heard his step on the stairs, and his chamber
      door close: and when she did sleep, her dreams were disturbed and painful.
      The next morning, when they met at breakfast (for Vaudemont did not return
      to London), her eyes were red and heavy, and her cheek pale. And, still
      buried in meditation, Vaudemont&rsquo;s eye, usually so kind and watchful, did
      not detect those signs of a grief that Fanny could not have explained.
      After breakfast, however, he asked her to walk out; and her face
      brightened as she hastened to put on her bonnet, and take her little
      basket full of fresh flowers which she had already sent Sarah forth to
      purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny,&rdquo; said Vaudemont, as leaving the house, he saw the basket on her
      arm, &ldquo;to-day you may place some of those flowers on another tombstone!&mdash;Poor
      child, what natural goodness there is in that heart!&mdash;what pity that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. Fanny looked delightedly in his face. &ldquo;You were praising me&mdash;you!
      And what is a pity, brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke, the sound of the joy-bells was heard near at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Vaudemont, forgetting her question&mdash;and almost gaily&mdash;&ldquo;Hark!&mdash;I
      accept the omen. It is a marriage peal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He quickened his steps, and they reached the churchyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a crowd already assembled, and Vaudemont and Fanny paused; and,
      leaning over the little gate, looked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are these people here, and why does the bell ring so merrily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is to be a wedding, Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of a wedding very often,&rdquo; said Fanny, with a pretty look of
      puzzlement and doubt, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it means. Will you
      tell me?&mdash;and the bells, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Fanny, those bells toll but three times for man! The first time,
      when he comes into the world; the last time, when he leaves it; the time
      between when he takes to his side a partner in all the sorrows&mdash;in
      all the joys that yet remain to him; and who, even when the last bell
      announces his death to this earth, may yet, for ever and ever, be his
      partner in that world to come&mdash;that heaven, where they who are as
      innocent as you, Fanny, may hope to live and to love each other in a land
      in which there are no graves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this bell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tolls for that partnership&mdash;for the wedding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand you;&mdash;and they who are to be wed are happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy, Fanny, if they love, and their love continue. Oh! conceive the
      happiness to know some one person dearer to you than your own self&mdash;some
      one breast into which you can pour every thought, every grief, every joy!
      One person, who, if all the rest of the world were to calumniate or
      forsake you, would never wrong you by a harsh thought or an unjust word,&mdash;who
      would cling to you the closer in sickness, in poverty, in care,&mdash;who
      would sacrifice all things to you, and for whom you would sacrifice all&mdash;from
      whom, except by death, night or day, you must be never divided&mdash;whose
      smile is ever at your hearth&mdash;who has no tears while you are well and
      happy, and your love the same. Fanny, such is marriage, if they who marry
      have hearts and souls to feel that there is no bond on earth so tender and
      so sublime. There is an opposite picture;&mdash;I will not draw that! And
      as it is, Fanny, you cannot understand me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away:&mdash;and Fanny&rsquo;s tears were falling like rain upon the
      grass below;&mdash;he did not see them! He entered the churchyard; for the
      bell now ceased. The ceremony was to begin. He followed the bridal party
      into the church, and Fanny, lowering her veil, crept after him, awed and
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood, unobserved, at a little distance, and heard the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The betrothed were of the middle class of life, young, both comely; and
      their behaviour was such as suited the reverence and sanctity of the rite.
      Vaudemont stood looking on intently, with his arms folded on his breast.
      Fanny leant behind him, and apart from all, against one of the pews. And
      still in her hand, while the priest was solemnising Marriage, she held the
      flowers intended for the Grave. Even to that MORNING&mdash;hushed, calm,
      earliest, with her mysterious and unconjectured heart&mdash;her shape
      brought a thought of NIGHT!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ceremony was over&mdash;when the bride fell on her mother&rsquo;s
      breast and wept; and then, when turning thence, her eyes met the
      bridegroom&rsquo;s, and the tears were all smiled away&mdash;when, in that one
      rapid interchange of looks, spoke all that holy love can speak to love,
      and with timid frankness she placed her hand in his to whom she had just
      vowed her life,&mdash;a thrill went through the hearts of those present.
      Vaudemont sighed heavily. He heard his sigh echoed; but by one that had in
      its sound no breath of pain; he turned; Fanny had raised her veil; her
      eyes met his, moistened, but bright, soft, and her cheeks were rosy-red.
      Vaudemont recoiled before that gaze, and turned from the church. The
      persons interested retired to the vestry to sign their names in the
      registry; the crowd dispersed, and Vaudemont and Fanny stood alone in the
      burial-ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Fanny,&rdquo; said the former, pointing to a tomb that stood far from his
      mother&rsquo;s (for those ashes were too hallowed for such a neighbourhood).
      &ldquo;Look yonder; it is a new tomb. Fanny, let us approach it. Can you read
      what is there inscribed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inscription was simply this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                TO W&mdash;
 G&mdash;
              MAN SEES THE DEED
            GOD THE CIRCUMSTANCE.
               JUDGE NOT,
             THAT YE BE NOT JUDGED.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny, this tomb fulfils your pious wish: it is to the memory of him whom
      you called your father. Whatever was his life here&mdash;whatever sentence
      it hath received, Heaven, at least, will not condemn your piety, if you
      honour one who was good to you, and place flowers, however idle, even over
      that grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his&mdash;my father&rsquo;s&mdash;and you have thought of this for me!&rdquo;
       said Fanny, taking his hand, and sobbing. &ldquo;And I have been thinking that
      you were not so kind to me as you were!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not been so kind to you? Nay, forgive me, I am not happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not?&mdash;you said yesterday you had been too happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To remember happiness is not to be happy, Fanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny stopped; and, as she bent over the tomb, musing, Vaudemont, willing
      to leave her undisturbed, and feeling bitterly how little his conscience
      could vindicate, though it might find palliation for, the dark man who
      slept not there&mdash;retired a few paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the new-married pair, with their witnesses, the clergyman,
      &amp;c., came from the vestry, and crossed the path. Fanny, as she turned
      from the tomb, saw them, and stood still, looking earnestly at the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely face!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Is it&mdash;yes it is&mdash;the
      poor idiot girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the bridegroom, tenderly, &ldquo;and she, Mary, beautiful as she is,
      she can never make another as happy as you have made me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont heard, and his heart felt sad. &ldquo;Poor Fanny!&mdash;And yet, but
      for that affliction&mdash;I might have loved her, ere I met the fatal face
      of the daughter of my foe!&rdquo; And with a deep compassion, an inexpressible
      and holy fondness, he moved to Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my child; now let us go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Fanny&mdash;&ldquo;you forget.&rdquo; And she went to strew the flowers
      still left over Catherine&rsquo;s grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will my mother,&rdquo; thought Vaudemont, &ldquo;forgive me, if I have other thoughts
      than hate and vengeance for that house which builds its greatness over her
      slandered name?&rdquo; He groaned:&mdash;and that grave had lost its melancholy
      charm.

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Of all men, I say,
        That dare, for &lsquo;tis a desperate adventure,
        Wear on their free necks the yoke of women,
        Give me a soldier.&rdquo;&mdash;Knight of Malta.

        &ldquo;So lightly doth this little boat
        Upon the scarce-touch&rsquo;d billows float;
        So careless doth she seem to be,
        Thus left by herself on the homeless sea,
        To lie there with her cheerful sail,
        Till Heaven shall send some gracious gale.&rdquo;
         WILSON: Isle of Palms.
</pre>
    <p>
      Vaudemont returned that evening to London, and found at his lodgings a
      note from Lord Lilburne, stating that as his gout was now somewhat
      mitigated, his physician had recommended him to try change of air&mdash;that
      Beaufort Court was in one of the western counties, in a genial climate&mdash;that
      he was therefore going thither the next day for a short time&mdash;that he
      had asked some of Monsieur de Vaudemont&rsquo;s countrymen, and a few other
      friends, to enliven the circle of a dull country-house&mdash;that Mr. and
      Mrs. Beaufort would be delighted to see Monsieur de Vaudemont also&mdash;and
      that his compliance with their invitation would be a charity to Monsieur
      de Vaudemont&rsquo;s faithful and obliged, LILBURNE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sensation of Vaudemont on reading this effusion was delight. &ldquo;I
      shall see her,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I shall be under the same roof!&rdquo; But the glow
      faded at once from his cheek;&mdash;the roof!&mdash;what roof? Be the
      guest where he held himself the lord!&mdash;be the guest of Robert
      Beaufort!&mdash;Was that all? Did he not meditate the deadliest war which
      civilised life admits of&mdash;the War of Law&mdash;war for name,
      property, that very hearth, with all its household gods, against this man&mdash;could
      he receive his hospitality? &ldquo;And what then!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he paced to
      and fro the room,&mdash;&ldquo;because her father wronged me, and because I
      would claim mine own&mdash;must I therefore exclude from my thoughts, from
      my sight, an image so fair and gentle;&mdash;the one who knelt by my side,
      an infant, to that hard man?&mdash;Is hate so noble a passion that it is
      not to admit one glimpse of Love?&mdash;Love! what word is that? Let me
      beware in time!&rdquo; He paused in fierce self-contest, and, throwing open the
      window, gasped for air. The street in which he lodged was situated in the
      neighbourhood of St. James&rsquo;s; and, at that very moment, as if to defeat
      all opposition, and to close the struggle, Mrs. Beaufort&rsquo;s barouche drove
      by, Camilla at her side. Mrs. Beaufort, glancing up; languidly bowed; and
      Camilla herself perceived him, and he saw her change colour as she
      inclined her head. He gazed after them almost breathless, till the
      carriage disappeared; and then reclosing the window, he sat down to
      collect his thoughts, and again to reason with himself. But still, as he
      reasoned, he saw ever before him that blush and that smile. At last he
      sprang up, and a noble and bright expression elevated the character of his
      face,&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, if I enter that house, if I eat that man&rsquo;s bread, and
      drink of his cup, I must forego, not justice&mdash;not what is due to my
      mother&rsquo;s name&mdash;but whatever belongs to hate and vengeance. If I enter
      that house&mdash;and if Providence permit me the means whereby to regain
      my rights, why she&mdash;the innocent one&mdash;she may be the means of
      saving her father from ruin, and stand like an angel by that boundary
      where justice runs into revenge!&mdash;Besides, is it not my duty to
      discover Sidney? Here is the only clue I shall obtain.&rdquo; With these
      thoughts he hesitated no more&mdash;he decided he would not reject this
      hospitality, since it might be in his power to pay it back ten
      thousandfold. &ldquo;And who knows,&rdquo; he murmured again, &ldquo;if Heaven, in throwing
      this sweet being in my way, might not have designed to subdue and chasten
      in me the angry passions I have so long fed on? I have seen her,&mdash;can
      I now hate her father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sent off his note accepting the invitation. When he had done so, was he
      satisfied? He had taken as noble and as large a view of the duties thereby
      imposed on him as he well could take: but something whispered at his
      heart, &ldquo;There is weakness in thy generosity&mdash;Darest thou love the
      daughter of Robert Beaufort?&rdquo; And his heart had no answer to this voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapidity with which love is ripened depends less upon the actual
      number of years that have passed over the soil in which the seed is cast,
      than upon the freshness of the soil itself. A young man who lives the
      ordinary life of the world, and who fritters away, rather than exhausts,
      his feelings upon a variety of quick succeeding subjects&mdash;the
      Cynthias of the minute&mdash;is not apt to form a real passion at the
      first sight. Youth is inflammable only when the heart is young!
    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain times of life when, in either sex, the affections are
      prepared, as it were, to be impressed with the first fair face that
      attracts the fancy and delights the eye. Such times are when the heart has
      been long solitary, and when some interval of idleness and rest succeeds
      to periods of harsher and more turbulent excitement. It was precisely such
      a period in the life of Vaudemont. Although his ambition had been for many
      years his dream, and his sword his mistress, yet naturally affectionate,
      and susceptible of strong emotion, he had often repined at his lonely lot.
      By degrees the boy&rsquo;s fantasy and reverence which had wound themselves
      round the image of Eugenie subsided into that gentle and tender melancholy
      which, perhaps by weakening the strength of the sterner thoughts, leaves
      us inclined rather to receive, than to resist, a new attachment;&mdash;and
      on the verge of the sweet Memory trembles the sweet Hope. The suspension
      of his profession, his schemes, his struggles, his career, left his
      passions unemployed. Vaudemont was thus unconsciously prepared to love. As
      we have seen, his first and earliest feelings directed themselves to
      Fanny. But he had so immediately detected the clanger, and so immediately
      recoiled from nursing those thoughts and fancies, without which love dies
      for want of food, for a person to whom he ascribed the affliction of an
      imbecility which would give to such a sentiment all the attributes either
      of the weakest rashness or of dishonour approaching to sacrilege&mdash;that
      the wings of the deity were scared away the instant their very shadow fell
      upon his mind. And thus, when Camilla rose upon him his heart was free to
      receive her image. Her graces, her accomplishments, a certain nameless
      charm that invested her, pleased him even more than her beauty; the
      recollections connected with that first time in which he had ever beheld
      her, were also grateful and endearing; the harshness with which her
      parents spoke to her moved his compassion, and addressed itself to a
      temper peculiarly alive to the generosity that leans towards the weak and
      the wronged; the engaging mixture of mildness and gaiety with which she
      tended her peevish and sneering uncle, convinced him of her better and
      more enduring qualities of disposition and womanly heart. And even&mdash;so
      strange and contradictory are our feelings&mdash;the very remembrance that
      she was connected with a family so hateful to him made her own image the
      more bright from the darkness that surrounded it. For was it not with the
      daughter of his foe that the lover of Verona fell in love at first sight?
      And is not that a common type of us all&mdash;as if Passion delighted in
      contradictions? As the Diver, in Schiller&rsquo;s exquisite ballad, fastened
      upon the rock of coral in the midst of the gloomy sea, so we cling the
      more gratefully to whatever of fair thought and gentle shelter smiles out
      to us in the depths of Hate and Strife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, perhaps, Vaudemont would not so suddenly and so utterly have rendered
      himself to a passion that began, already, completely to master his strong
      spirit, if he had not, from Camilla&rsquo;s embarrassment, her timidity, her
      blushes, intoxicated himself with the belief that his feelings were not
      unshared. And who knows not that such a belief, once cherished, ripens our
      own love to a development in which hours are as years?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, then, with such emotions as made him almost insensible to every
      thought but the luxury of breathing the same air as his cousin, which
      swept from his mind the Past, the Future&mdash;leaving nothing but a
      joyous, a breathless PRESENT on the Face of Time, that he repaired to
      Beaufort Court. He did not return to H&mdash;&mdash; before he went, but
      he wrote to Fanny a short and hurried line to explain that he might be
      absent for some days at least, and promised to write again, if he should
      be detained longer than he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, one of those successive revolutions which had marked the
      eras in Fanny&rsquo;s moral existence took its date from that last time they had
      walked and conversed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very evening of that day, some hours after Philip was gone, and after
      Simon had retired to rest, Fanny was sitting before the dying fire in the
      little parlour in an attitude of deep and pensive reverie. The old
      woman-servant, Sarah, who, very different from Mrs. Boxer, loved Fanny
      with her whole heart, came into the room as was her wont before going to
      bed, to see that the fire was duly out, and all safe: and as she
      approached the hearth, she started to see Fanny still up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart alive!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;why, Miss Fanny, you will catch your death
      of cold,&mdash;what are you thinking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Sarah; I want to speak to you.&rdquo; Now, though Fanny was
      exceedingly kind, and attached to Sarah, she was seldom communicative to
      her, or indeed to any one. It was usually in its own silence and darkness
      that that lovely mind worked out its own doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, my sweet young lady? I&rsquo;m sure anything I can do&mdash;&rdquo; and Sarah
      seated herself in her master&rsquo;s great chair, and drew it close to Fanny.
      There was no light in the room but the expiring fire, and it threw upward
      a pale glimmer on the two faces bending over it,&mdash;the one so
      strangely beautiful, so smooth, so blooming, so exquisite in its youth and
      innocence,&mdash;the other withered, wrinkled, meagre, and astute. It was
      like the Fairy and the Witch together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, miss,&rdquo; said the crone, observing that, after a considerable pause,
      Fanny was still silent,&mdash;&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah, I have seen a wedding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; and the old woman laughed. &ldquo;Oh! I heard it was to be to-day!&mdash;young
      Waldron&rsquo;s wedding! Yes, they have been long sweethearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ever married, Sarah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless you,&mdash;yes! and a very good husband I had, poor man! But
      he&rsquo;s dead these many years; and if you had not taken me, I must have gone
      to the workhus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead! Wasn&rsquo;t it very hard to live after that, Sarah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord strengthens the hearts of widders!&rdquo; observed Sarah,
      sanctimoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you marry your brother, Sarah?&rdquo; said Fanny, playing with the corner
      of her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; exclaimed the old woman, aghast. &ldquo;La! miss, you must not
      talk in that way,&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite wicked and heathenish! One must not
      marry one&rsquo;s brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Fanny, tremblingly, and turning very pale, even by that light.
      &ldquo;No!&mdash;are you sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the wickedest thing even to talk about, my dear young mistress;&mdash;but
      you&rsquo;re like a babby unborn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was silent for some moments. At length she said, unconscious that
      she was speaking aloud, &ldquo;But he is not my brother, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, miss, fie! Are you letting your pretty head run on the handsome
      gentleman. You, too,&mdash;dear, dear! I see we&rsquo;re all alike, we poor
      femel creturs! You! who&rsquo;d have thought it? Oh, Miss Fanny!&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      break your heart if you goes for to fancy any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any what thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that that gentleman will marry you!&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure, tho&rsquo; he&rsquo;s so
      simple like, he&rsquo;s some great gentleman! They say his hoss is worth a
      hundred pounds! Dear, dear! why didn&rsquo;t I ever think of this before? He
      must be a very wicked man. I see, now, why he comes here. I&rsquo;ll speak to
      him, that I will!&mdash;a very wicked man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarah was startled from her indignation by Fanny&rsquo;s rising suddenly, and
      standing before her in the flickering twilight, almost like a shape
      transformed,&mdash;so tall did she seem, so stately, so dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it of him that you are speaking?&rdquo; said she, in a voice of calm but
      deep resentment&mdash;&ldquo;of him! If so, Sarah, we two can live no more in
      the same house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And these words were said with a propriety and collectedness that even,
      through all her terrors, showed at once to Sarah how much they now wronged
      Fanny who had suffered their lips to repeat the parrot-cry of the &ldquo;idiot
      girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! gracious me!&mdash;miss&mdash;ma&rsquo;am&mdash;I am so sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;d
      rather bite out my tongue than say a word to offend you; it was only my
      love for you, dear innocent creature that you are!&rdquo; and the honest woman
      sobbed with real passion as she clasped Fanny&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;There have been so
      many young persons, good and harmless, yes, even as you are, ruined. But
      you don&rsquo;t understand me. Miss Fanny! hear me; I must try and say what I
      would say. That man, that gentleman&mdash;so proud, so well-dressed, so
      grand-like, will never marry you, never&mdash;never. And if ever he says
      he does love you, and you say you love him, and you two don&rsquo;t marry, you
      will be ruined and wicked, and die&mdash;die of a broken heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The earnestness of Sarah&rsquo;s manner subdued and almost awed Fanny. She sank
      down again in her chair, and suffered the old woman to caress and weep
      over her hand for some moments in a silence that concealed the darkest and
      most agitated feelings Fanny&rsquo;s life had hitherto known. At length she
      said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why may he not marry me if he loves me?&mdash;he is not my brother,&mdash;indeed
      he is not! I&rsquo;ll never call him so again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot marry you,&rdquo; said Sarah, resolved, with a sort of rude
      nobleness, to persevere in what she felt to be a duty; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say
      anything about money, because that does not always signify. But he cannot
      marry you, because&mdash;because people who are hedicated one way never
      marry those who are hedicated and brought up in another. A gentleman of
      that kind requires a wife to know&mdash;oh&mdash;to know ever so much; and
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo; interrupted Fanny, rising again, but this time with a smile on
      her face, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say anything more about it; I forgive you, if you promise
      never to speak unkindly of him again&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;never,
      Sarah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But may I just tell him that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are so young and innocent, and has no pertector like; and that
      if you were to love him it would be a shame in him&mdash;that it would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then (oh, no, Fanny, there was nothing clouded now in your reason!)&mdash;and
      then the woman&rsquo;s alarm, the modesty, the instinct, the terror came upon
      her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never! never! I will not love him, I do not love him, indeed, Sarah. If
      you speak to him, I will never look you in the face again. It is all past&mdash;all,
      dear Sarah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed the old woman; and Sarah, fancying that her sagacity and
      counsel had prevailed, promised all she was asked; so they went up-stairs
      together&mdash;friends.

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;As the wind
        Sobs, an uncertain sweetness comes from out
        The orange-trees.

        Rise up, Olympia.&mdash;She sleeps soundly. Ho!
        Stirring at last.&rdquo; BARRY CORNWALL.
</pre>
    <p>
      The next day, Fanny was seen by Sarah counting the little hoard that she
      had so long and so painfully saved for her benefactor&rsquo;s tomb. The money
      was no longer wanted for that object. Fanny had found another; she said
      nothing to Sarah or to Simon. But there was a strange complacent smile
      upon her lip as she busied herself in her work, that puzzled the old
      woman. Late at noon came the postman&rsquo;s unwonted knock at the door. A
      letter!&mdash;a letter for Miss Fanny. A letter!&mdash;the first she had
      ever received in her life! And it was from him!&mdash;and it began with
      &ldquo;Dear Fanny.&rdquo; Vaudemont had called her &ldquo;dear Fanny&rdquo; a hundred times, and
      the expression had become a matter of course. But &ldquo;Dear Fanny&rdquo; seemed so
      very different when it was written. The letter could not well be shorter,
      nor, all things considered, colder. But the girl found no fault with it.
      It began with &ldquo;Dear Fanny,&rdquo; and it ended with &ldquo;yours truly.&rdquo; &ldquo;&mdash;Yours
      truly&mdash;mine truly&mdash;and how kind to write at all!&rdquo; Now it so
      happened that Vaudemont, having never merged the art of the penman into
      that rapid scrawl into which people, who are compelled to write hurriedly
      and constantly, degenerate, wrote a remarkably good hand,&mdash;bold,
      clear, symmetrical&mdash;almost too good a hand for one who was not to
      make money by caligraphy. And after Fanny had got the words by heart, she
      stole gently to a cupboard and took forth some specimens of her own hand,
      in the shape of house and work memoranda, and extracts which, the better
      to help her memory, she had made from the poem-book Vaudemont had given
      her. She gravely laid his letter by the side of these specimens, and
      blushed at the contrast; yet, after all, her own writing, though trembling
      and irresolute, was far from a bad or vulgar hand. But emulation was now
      fairly roused within her. Vaudemont, pre-occupied by more engrossing
      thoughts, and indeed, forgetting a danger which had seemed so thoroughly
      to have passed away, did not in his letter caution Fanny against going out
      alone. She remarked this; and having completely recovered her own alarm at
      the attempt that had been made on her liberty, she thought she was now
      released from her promise to guard against a past and imaginary peril. So
      after dinner she slipped out alone, and went to the mistress of the school
      where she had received her elementary education. She had ever since
      continued her acquaintance with that lady, who, kindhearted, and touched
      by her situation, often employed her industry, and was far from blind to
      the improvement that had for some time been silently working in the mind
      of her old pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny had a long conversation with this lady, and she brought back a
      bundle of books. The light might have been seen that night, and many
      nights after, burning long and late from her little window. And having
      recovered her old freedom of habits, which Simon, poor man, did not
      notice, and which Sarah, thinking that anything was better than moping at
      home, did not remonstrate against, Fanny went out regularly for two hours,
      or sometimes for even a longer period, every evening after old Simon had
      composed himself to the nap that filled up the interval between dinner and
      tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a very short time&mdash;a time that with ordinary stimulants would have
      seemed marvellously short&mdash;Fanny&rsquo;s handwriting was not the same
      thing; her manner of talking became different; she no longer called
      herself &ldquo;Fanny&rdquo; when she spoke; the music of her voice was more quiet and
      settled; her sweet expression of face was more thoughtful; the eyes seemed
      to have deepened in their very colour; she was no longer heard chaunting
      to herself as she tripped along. The books that she nightly fed on had
      passed into her mind; the poetry that had ever unconsciously sported round
      her young years began now to create poetry in herself. Nay, it might
      almost have seemed as if that restless disorder of the intellect, which
      the dullards had called Idiotcy, had been the wild efforts, not of Folly,
      but of GENIUS seeking to find its path and outlet from the cold and dreary
      solitude to which the circumstances of her early life had compelled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days, even weeks, passed&mdash;she never spoke of Vaudemont. And once,
      when Sarah, astonished and bewildered by the change in her young mistress,
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does the gentleman come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny answered, with a mysterious smile, &ldquo;Not yet, I hope,&mdash;not quite
      yet!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Vaudemont had now been a month at Beaufort Court. The scene of a
      country-house, with the sports that enliven it, and the accomplishments it
      calls forth, was one in which he was well fitted to shine. He had been an
      excellent shot as a boy; and though long unused to the fowling-piece, had,
      in India, acquired a deadly precision with the rifle; so that a very few
      days of practice in the stubbles and covers of Beaufort Court made his
      skill the theme of the guests and the admiration of the keepers. Hunting
      began, and&mdash;this pursuit, always so strong a passion in the active
      man, and which, to the turbulence and agitation of his half-tamed breast,
      now excited by a kind of frenzy of hope and fear, gave a vent and release&mdash;was
      a sport in which he was yet more fitted to excel. His horsemanship, his
      daring, the stone walls he leaped and the floods through which he dashed,
      furnished his companions with wondering tale and comment on their return
      home. Mr. Marsden, who, with some other of Arthur&rsquo;s early friends, had
      been invited to Beaufort Court, in order to welcome its expected heir, and
      who retained all the prudence which had distinguished him of yore, when
      having ridden over old Simon he dismounted to examine the knees of his
      horse;&mdash;Mr. Marsden, a skilful huntsman, who rode the most
      experienced horses in the world, and who generally contrived to be in at
      the death without having leaped over anything higher than a hurdle,
      suffering the bolder quadruped (in case what is called the &ldquo;knowledge of
      the country&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the knowledge of gaps and gates&mdash;failed
      him) to perform the more dangerous feats alone, as he quietly scrambled
      over or scrambled through upon foot, and remounted the well-taught animal
      when it halted after the exploit, safe and sound;&mdash;Mr. Marsden
      declared that he never saw a rider with so little judgment as Monsieur de
      Vaudemont, and that the devil was certainly in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sort of reputation, commonplace and merely physical as it was in
      itself, had a certain effect upon Camilla; it might be an effect of fear.
      I do not say, for I do not know, what her feelings towards Vaudemont
      exactly were. As the calmest natures are often those the most hurried away
      by their contraries, so, perhaps, he awed and dazzled rather than pleased
      her;&mdash;at least, he certainly forced himself on her interest. Still
      she would have started in terror if any one had said to her, &ldquo;Do you love
      your betrothed less than when you met by that happy lake?&rdquo;&mdash;and her
      heart would have indignantly rebuked the questioner. The letters of her
      lover were still long and frequent; hers were briefer and more subdued.
      But then there was constraint in the correspondence&mdash;it was submitted
      to her mother. Whatever might be Vaudemont&rsquo;s manner to Camilla whenever
      occasion threw them alone together, he certainly did not make his
      attentions glaring enough to be remarked. His eye watched her rather than
      his lip addressed; he kept as much aloof as possible from the rest of her
      family, and his customary bearing was silent even to gloom. But there were
      moments when he indulged in a fitful exuberance of spirits, which had
      something strained and unnatural. He had outlived Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s short
      liking; for since he had resolved no longer to keep watch on that noble
      gamester&rsquo;s method of play, he played but little himself; and Lord Lilburne
      saw that he had no chance of ruining him&mdash;there was, therefore, no
      longer any reason to like him. But this was not all; when Vaudemont had
      been at the house somewhat more than two weeks, Lilburne, petulant and
      impatient, whether at his refusals to join the card-table, or at the
      moderation with which, when he did, he confined his ill-luck to petty
      losses, one day limped up to him, as he stood at the embrasure of the
      window, gazing on the wide lands beyond, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vaudemont, you are bolder in hunting, they tell me, than you are at
      whist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honours don&rsquo;t tell against one&mdash;over a hedge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Lilburne, rather haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont was, at that moment, in one of those bitter moods when the sense
      of his situation, the sight of the usurper in his home, often swept away
      the gentler thoughts inspired by his fatal passion. And the tone of Lord
      Lilburne, and his loathing to the man, were too much for his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Lilburne,&rdquo; he said, and his lip curled, &ldquo;if you had been born poor,
      you would have made a great fortune&mdash;you play luckily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to take this, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; answered Vaudemont, calmly, but with an eye of fire. And
      he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilburne remained on the spot very thoughtful: &ldquo;Hum! he suspects me. I
      cannot quarrel on such ground&mdash;the suspicion itself dishonours me&mdash;I
      must seek another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day, Lilburne, who was familiar with Mr. Harsden (though the
      latter gentleman never played at the same table), asked that prudent
      person after breakfast if he happened to have his pistols with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I always take them into the country&mdash;one may as well practise
      when one has the opportunity. Besides, sportsmen are often quarrelsome;
      and if it is known that one shoots well,&mdash;it keeps one out of
      quarrels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said Lilburne, rather admiringly. &ldquo;I have made the same
      remark myself when I was younger. I have not shot with a pistol for some
      years. I am well enough now to walk out with the help of a stick. Suppose
      we practise for half-an-hour or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Mr. Marsden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pistols were brought, and they strolled forth;&mdash;Lord Lilburne
      found his hand out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I never hunt now,&rdquo; said the peer, and he gnashed his teeth, and
      glanced at his maimed limb; &ldquo;for though lameness would not prevent my
      keeping my seat, violent exercise hurts my leg; and Brodie says any fresh
      accident might bring on tic douloureux;&mdash;and as my gout does not
      permit me to join the shooting parties at present, it would be a kindness
      in you to lend me your pistols&mdash;it would while away an hour or so;
      though, thank Heaven, my duelling days are over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Marsden; and the pistols were consigned to Lord
      Lilburne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days from the date, as Mr. Marsden, Vaudemont, and some other
      gentlemen were making for the covers, they came upon Lord Lilburne, who,
      in a part of the park not within sight or sound of the house, was amusing
      himself with Mr. Marsden&rsquo;s pistols, which Dykeman was at hand to load for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round, not at all disconcerted by the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea how I&rsquo;ve improved, Marsden:&mdash;just see!&rdquo; and he
      pointed to a glove nailed to a tree. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hit that mark twice in five
      times; and every time I have gone straight enough along the line to have
      killed my man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the mark itself does not so much signify,&rdquo; said Mr. Marsden, &ldquo;at
      least, not in actual duelling&mdash;the great thing is to be in the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s ball went a third time through the glove.
      His cold bright eye turned on Vaudemont, as he said, with a smile,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me you shoot well with a fowling-piece, my dear Vaudemont&mdash;are
      you equally adroit with a pistol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may see, if you like; but you take aim, Lord Lilburne; that would be
      of no use in English duelling. Permit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the glove, and tore from it one of the fingers, which he
      fastened separately to the tree, took the pistol from Dykeman as he walked
      past him, gained the spot whence to fire, turned at once round, without
      apparent aim, and the finger fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilburne stood aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; said Marsden; &ldquo;quite wonderful. Where the devil did
      you get such a knack?&mdash;for it is only knack after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lived for many years in a country where the practice was constant,
      where all that belongs to rifle-shooting was a necessary accomplishment&mdash;a
      country in which man had often to contend against the wild beast. In
      civilised states, man himself supplies the place of the wild beast&mdash;but
      we don&rsquo;t hunt him!&mdash;Lord Lilburne&rdquo; (and this was added with a smiling
      and disdainful whisper), &ldquo;you must practise a little more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, disregardful of the advice, from that day Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s morning
      occupation was gone. He thought no longer of a duel with Vaudemont. As
      soon as the sportsman had left him, he bade Dykeman take up the pistols,
      and walked straight home into the library, where Robert Beaufort, who was
      no sportsman, generally spent his mornings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung himself into an arm-chair, and said, as he stirred the fire with
      unusual vehemence,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beaufort, I&rsquo;m very sorry I asked you to invite Vaudemont. He&rsquo;s a very
      ill-bred, disagreeable fellow!&rdquo; Beaufort threw down his steward&rsquo;s
      account-book, on which he was employed, and replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lilburne, I have never had an easy moment since that man has been in the
      house. As he was your guest, I did not like to speak before, but don&rsquo;t you
      observe&mdash;you must observe&mdash;how like he is to the old family
      portraits? The more I have examined him, the more another resemblance
      grows upon me. In a word,&rdquo; said Robert, pausing and breathing hard, &ldquo;if
      his name were not Vaudemont&mdash;if his history were not, apparently, so
      well known, I should say&mdash;I should swear, that it is Philip Morton
      who sleeps under this roof!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Lilburne, with an earnestness that surprised Beaufort, who
      expected to have heard his brother-in-law&rsquo;s sneering sarcasm at his fears;
      &ldquo;the likeness you speak of to the old portraits did strike me; it struck
      Marsden, too, the other day, as we were passing through the
      picture-gallery; and Marsden remarked it aloud to Vaudemont. I remember
      now that he changed countenance and made no answer. Hush! hush! hold your
      tongue, let me think&mdash;let me think. This Philip&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I
      and Arthur saw him with&mdash;with Gawtrey&mdash;in Paris&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawtrey! was that the name of the rogue he was said to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes. Ah! now I guess the meaning of those looks&mdash;those
      words,&rdquo; muttered Lilburne between his teeth. &ldquo;This pretension to the name
      of Vaudemont was always apocryphal&mdash;the story always but half
      believed&mdash;the invention of a woman in love with him&mdash;the claim
      on your property is made at the very time he appears in England. Ha! Have
      you a newspaper there? Give it me. No! &lsquo;tis not in this paper. Ring the
      bell for the file!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? you terrify me!&rdquo; gasped out Mr. Beaufort, as he rang
      the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! have you not seen an advertisement repeated several times within the
      last month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never read advertisements; except in the county paper, if land is to be
      sold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I often; but this caught my eye. John&rdquo; (here the servant entered),
      &ldquo;bring the file of the newspapers. The name of the witness whom Mrs.
      Morton appealed to was Smith, the same name as the captain; what was the
      Christian name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the papers&mdash;shut the door&mdash;and here is the
      advertisement: &lsquo;If Mr. William Smith, son of Jeremiah Smith, who formerly
      rented the farm of Shipdale-Bury, under the late Right Hon. Charles
      Leopold Beaufort (that&rsquo;s your uncle), and who emigrated in the year 18&mdash;
      to Australia, will apply to Mr. Barlow, Solicitor, Essex Street, Strand,
      he will hear of something to his advantage.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! why did not you mention this to me before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I did not think it of any importance. In the first place, there
      might be some legacy left to the man, quite distinct from your business.
      Indeed, that was the probable supposition;&mdash;or even if connected with
      the claim, such an advertisement might be but a despicable attempt to
      frighten you. Never mind&mdash;don&rsquo;t look so pale&mdash;after all, this is
      a proof that the witness is not found&mdash;that Captain Smith is neither
      the Smith, nor has discovered where the Smith is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; observed Mr. Beaufort: &ldquo;true&mdash;very true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne, who was still rapidly glancing over the file&mdash;&ldquo;Here
      is another advertisement which I never saw before: this looks suspicious:
      &lsquo;If the person who called on the &mdash; of September, on Mr. Morton,
      linendraper, &amp;c., of N&mdash;&mdash;, will renew his application
      personally or by letter, he may now obtain the information he sought
      for.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morton!&mdash;the woman&rsquo;s brother! their uncle! it is too clear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what brings this man, if he be really Philip Morton, what brings him
      here!&mdash;to spy or to threaten?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will get him out of the house this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no; turn the watch upon himself. I see now; he is attracted by
      your daughter; sound her quietly; don&rsquo;t tell her to discourage his
      confidences; find out if he ever speaks of these Mortons. Ha! I recollect&mdash;he
      has spoken to me of the Mortons, but vaguely&mdash;I forget what. Humph!
      this is a man of spirit and daring&mdash;watch him, I say,&mdash;watch
      him! When does Arthur came back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been travelling so slowly, for he still complains of his health,
      and has had relapses; but he ought to be in Paris this week, perhaps he is
      there now. Good Heavens! he must not meet this man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what I tell you! get out all from your daughter. Never fear: he can do
      nothing against you except by law. But if he really like Camilla&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&mdash;Philip Morton&mdash;the adventurer&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the eldest son: remember you thought even of accepting the second.
      He&mdash;nay find the witness&mdash;he may win his suit; if he likes
      Camilla, there may be a compromise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort felt as if turned to ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think him likely to win this infamous suit, then?&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not you guard against the possibility by securing the brother? More
      worth while to do it with this man. Hark ye! the politics of private are
      like those of public life,&mdash;when the state can&rsquo;t crush a demagogue,
      it should entice him over. If you can ruin this dog&rdquo; (and Lilburne stamped
      his foot fiercely, forgetful of the gout), &ldquo;ruin him! hang him! If you
      can&rsquo;t&rdquo; (and here with a wry face he caressed the injured foot), &ldquo;if you
      can&rsquo;t (&lsquo;sdeath, what a twinge!), and he can ruin you,&mdash;bring him into
      the family, and make his secret ours! I must go and lie down&mdash;I have
      overexcited myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In great perplexity Beaufort repaired at once to Camilla. His nervous
      agitation betrayed itself, though he smiled a ghastly smile, and intended
      to be exceeding cool and collected. His questions, which confused and
      alarmed her, soon drew out the fact that the very first time Vaudemont had
      been introduced to her he had spoken of the Mortons; and that he had often
      afterwards alluded to the subject, and seemed at first strongly impressed
      with the notion that the younger brother was under Beaufort&rsquo;s protection;
      though at last he appeared reluctantly convinced of the contrary. Robert,
      however agitated, preserved at least enough of his natural slyness not to
      let out that he suspected Vaudemont to be Philip Morton himself, for he
      feared lest his daughter should betray that suspicion to its object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, with a look meant to win confidence, &ldquo;I dare say he knows
      these young men. I should like myself to know more about them. Learn all
      you can, and tell me, and, I say&mdash;I say, Camilla,&mdash;he! he! he!&mdash;you
      have made a conquest, you little flirt, you! Did he, this Vaudemont, ever
      say how much he admired you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&mdash;never!&rdquo; said Camilla, blushing, and then turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he looks it. Ah! you say nothing, then. Well, well, don&rsquo;t discourage
      him; that is to say,&mdash;yes, don&rsquo;t discourage him. Talk to him as much
      as you can,&mdash;ask him about his own early life. I&rsquo;ve a particular wish
      to know&mdash;&lsquo;tis of great importance to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear father,&rdquo; said Camilla, trembling and thoroughly bewildered,
      &ldquo;I fear this man,&mdash;I fear&mdash;I fear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was she going to add, &ldquo;I fear myself?&rdquo; I know not; but she stopped short,
      and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang these girls!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Beaufort, &ldquo;always crying when they ought
      to be of use to one. Go down, dry your eyes, do as I tell you,&mdash;get
      all you can from him. Fear him!&mdash;yes, I dare say she does!&rdquo; muttered
      the poor man, as he closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time what wonder that Camilla&rsquo;s manner to Vaudemont was yet more
      embarrassed than ever: what wonder that he put his own heart&rsquo;s
      interpretation on that confusion. Beaufort took care to thrust her more
      often than before in his way; he suddenly affected a creeping, fawning
      civility to Vaudemont; he was sure he was fond of music; what did he think
      of that new air Camilla was so fond of? He must be a judge of scenery, he
      who had seen so much: there were beautiful landscapes in the
      neighbourhood, and, if he would forego his sports, Camilla drew prettily,
      had an eye for that sort of thing, and was so fond of riding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont was astonished at this change, but his delight was greater than
      the astonishment. He began to perceive that his identity was suspected;
      perhaps Beaufort, more generous than he had deemed him, meant to repay
      every early wrong or harshness by one inestimable blessing. The generous
      interpret motives in extremes&mdash;ever too enthusiastic or too severe.
      Vaudemont felt as if he had wronged the wronger; he began to conquer even
      his dislike to Robert Beaufort. For some days he was thus thrown much with
      Camilla; the questions her father forced her to put to him, uttered
      tremulously and fearfully, seemed to him proof of her interest in his
      fate. His feelings to Camilla, so sudden in their growth&mdash;so ripened
      and so favoured by the Sub-Ruler of the world&mdash;CIRCUMSTANCE&mdash;might
      not, perhaps, have the depth and the calm completeness of that, One True
      Love, of which there are many counterfeits,&mdash;and which in Man, at
      least, possibly requires the touch and mellowness, if not of time, at
      least of many memories&mdash;of perfect and tried conviction of the faith,
      the worth, the value and the beauty of the heart to which it clings;&mdash;but
      those feelings were, nevertheless, strong, ardent, and intense. He
      believed himself beloved&mdash;he was in Elysium. But he did not yet
      declare the passion that beamed in his eyes. No! he would not yet claim
      the hand of Camilla Beaufort, for he imagined the time would soon come
      when he could claim it, not as the inferior or the suppliant, but as the
      lord of her father&rsquo;s fate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something got amongst us!&rdquo;&mdash;Knight of Malta.
</pre>
    <p>
      Two or three nights after his memorable conversation with Robert Beaufort,
      as Lord Lilburne was undressing, he said to his valet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dykeman, I am getting well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my lord, I never saw your lordship look better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you lie. I looked better last year&mdash;I looked better the year
      before&mdash;and I looked better and better every year back to the age of
      twenty-one! But I&rsquo;m not talking of looks, no man with money wants looks. I
      am talking of feelings. I feel better. The gout is almost gone. I have
      been quiet now for a month&mdash;that&rsquo;s a long time&mdash;time wasted
      when, at my age, I have so little time to waste. Besides, as you know, I
      am very much in love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love, my lord? I thought that you told me never to speak of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blockhead! what the deuce was the good of speaking about it when I was
      wrapped in flannels! I am never in love when I am ill&mdash;who is? I am
      well now, or nearly so; and I&rsquo;ve had things to vex me&mdash;things to make
      this place very disagreeable; I shall go to town, and before this day
      week, perhaps, that charming face may enliven the solitude of Fernside. I
      shall look to it myself now. I see you&rsquo;re going to say something. Spare
      yourself the trouble! nothing ever goes wrong if I myself take it in
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day Lord Lilburne, who, in truth, felt himself uncomfortable and
      <i>gene</i> in the presence of Vaudemont; who had won as much as the
      guests at Beaufort Court seemed inclined to lose; and who made it the rule
      of his life to consult his own pleasure and amusement before anything
      else, sent for his post-horses, and informed his brother-in-law of his
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you leave me alone with this man just when I am convinced that he is
      the person we suspected! My dear Lilburne, do stay till he goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! I am between fifty and sixty&mdash;every moment is precious
      at that time of life. Besides, I&rsquo;ve said all I can say; rest quiet&mdash;act
      on the defensive&mdash;entangle this cursed Vaudemont, or Morton, or
      whoever he be, in the mesh of your daughter&rsquo;s charms, and then get rid of
      him, not before. This can do no harm, let the matter turn out how it will.
      Read the papers; and send for Blackwell if you want advice on any new
      advertisements. I don&rsquo;t see that anything more is to be done at present.
      You can write to me; I shall be at Park Lane or Fernside. Take care of
      yourself. You&rsquo;re a lucky fellow&mdash;you never have the gout! Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in half an hour Lord Lilburne was on the road to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The departure of Lilburne was a signal to many others, especially and
      naturally to those he himself had invited. He had not announced to such
      visitors his intention of going till his carriage was at the door. This
      might be delicacy or carelessness, just as people chose to take it: and
      how they did take it, Lord Lilburne, much too selfish to be well-bred, did
      not care a rush. The next day half at least of the guests were gone; and
      even Mr. Marsden, who had been specially invited on Arthur&rsquo;s account,
      announced that he should go after dinner! he always travelled by night&mdash;he
      slept well on the road&mdash;a day was not lost by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is so long since you saw Arthur,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, in
      remonstrance, &ldquo;and I expect him every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sorry&mdash;best fellow in the world&mdash;but the fact is, that I
      am not very well myself. I want a little sea air; I shall go to Dover or
      Brighton. But I suppose you will have the house full again about
      Christmas; in that case I shall be delighted to repeat my visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, that Mr. Marsden, without Lilburne&rsquo;s intellect on the one
      hand, or vices on the other, was, like that noble sensualist, one of the
      broken pieces of the great looking-glass &ldquo;SELF.&rdquo; He was noticed in society
      as always haunting the places where Lilburne played at cards, carefully
      choosing some other table, and as carefully betting upon Lilburne&rsquo;s side.
      The card-tables were now broken up; Vaudemont&rsquo;s superiority in shooting,
      and the manner in which he engrossed the talk of the sportsmen, displeased
      him. He was bored&mdash;he wanted to be off&mdash;and off he went.
      Vaudemont felt that the time was come for him to depart, too; Robert
      Beaufort&mdash;who felt in his society the painful fascination of the bird
      with the boa, who hated to see him there, and dreaded to see him depart,
      who had not yet extracted all the confirmation of his persuasions that he
      required, for Vaudemont easily enough parried the artless questions of
      Camilla&mdash;pressed him to stay with so eager a hospitality, and made
      Camilla herself falter out, against her will, and even against her
      remonstrances&mdash;(she never before had dared to remonstrate with either
      father or mother),&mdash;&ldquo;Could not you stay a few days longer?&rdquo;&mdash;that
      Vaudemont was too contented to yield to his own inclinations; and so for
      some little time longer he continued to move before the eyes of Mr.
      Beaufort&mdash;stern, sinister, silent, mysterious&mdash;like one of the
      family pictures stepped down from its frame. Vaudemont wrote, however, to
      Fanny, to excuse his delay; and anxious to hear from her as to her own and
      Simon&rsquo;s health, bade her direct her letter to his lodging in London (of
      which he gave her the address), whence, if he still continued to defer his
      departure, it would be forwarded to him. He did not do this, however, till
      he had been at Beaufort Court several days after Lilburne&rsquo;s departure, and
      till, in fact, two days before the eventful one which closed his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party, now greatly diminished; were at breakfast, when the servant
      entered, as usual, with the letter-bag. Mr. Beaufort, who was always
      important and pompous in the small ceremonials of life, unlocked the
      precious deposit with slow dignity, drew forth the newspapers, which he
      threw on the table, and which the gentlemen of the party eagerly seized;
      then, diving out one by one, jerked first a letter to Camilla, next a
      letter to Vaudemont, and, thirdly, seized a letter for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg that there may be no ceremony, Monsieur de Vaudemont: pray excuse
      me and follow my example: I see this letter is from my son;&rdquo; and he broke
      the seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FATHER,&mdash;Almost as soon as you receive this, I shall be with
      you. Ill as I am, I can have no peace till I see and consult you. The most
      startling&mdash;the most painful intelligence has just been conveyed to
      me. It is of a nature not to bear any but personal communication.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Your affectionate son,
                     &ldquo;ARTHUR BEAUFORT.
&ldquo;Boulogne.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;This will go by the same packet-boat that I shall take myself,
      and can only reach you a few hours before I arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s trembling hand dropped the letter&mdash;he grasped the
      elbow of the chair to save himself from falling. It was clear!&mdash;the
      same visitor who had persecuted himself had now sought his son! He grew
      sick, his son might have heard the witness&mdash;might be convinced. His
      son himself now appeared to him as a foe&mdash;for the father dreaded the
      son&rsquo;s honour! He glanced furtively round the table, till his eye rested on
      Vaudemont, and his terror was redoubled, for Vaudemont&rsquo;s face, usually so
      calm, was animated to an extraordinary degree, as he now lifted it from
      the letter he had just read. Their eyes met. Robert Beaufort looked on him
      as a prisoner at the bar looks on the accusing counsel, when he first
      commences his harangue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beaufort,&rdquo; said the guest, &ldquo;the letter you have given me summons me
      to London on important business, and immediately. Suffer me to send for
      horses at your earliest convenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the feeble and seldom heard voice of Mrs.
      Beaufort. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Robert?&mdash;is Arthur coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He comes to-day,&rdquo; said the father, with a deep sigh; and Vaudemont, at
      that moment rising from his half-finished breakfast, with a bow that
      included the group, and with a glance that lingered on Camilla, as she
      bent over her own unopened letter (a letter from Winandermere, the seal of
      which she dared not yet to break), quitted the room. He hastened to his
      own chamber, and strode to and fro with a stately step&mdash;the step of
      the Master&mdash;then, taking forth the letter, he again hurried over its
      contents. They ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR, Sir,&mdash;At last the missing witness has applied to me. He proves
      to be, as you conjectured, the same person who had called on Mr. Roger
      Morton; but as there are some circumstances on which I wish to take your
      instructions without a moment&rsquo;s delay, I shall leave London by the mail,
      and wait you at D&mdash;&mdash; (at the principal inn), which is, I
      understand, twenty miles on the high road from Beaufort Court.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            &ldquo;I have the honor to be, sir,
                  &ldquo;Yours, &amp;c.,
                      &ldquo;JOHN BARLOW.
</pre>
    <p>
      Vaudemont was yet lost in the emotions that this letter aroused, when they
      came to announce that his chaise was arrived. As he went down the stairs
      he met Camilla, who was on the way to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Beaufort,&rdquo; said he, in a low and tremulous voice, &ldquo;in wishing you
      farewell I may not now say more. I leave you, and, strange to say, I do
      not regret it, for I go upon an errand that may entitle me to return
      again, and speak those thoughts which are uppermost in my soul even at
      this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised her hand to his lips as he spoke, and at that moment Mr.
      Beaufort looked from the door of his own room, and cried, &ldquo;Camilla.&rdquo; She
      was too glad to escape. Philip gazed after her light form for an instant,
      and then hurried down the stairs.

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Longueville.&mdash;What! are you married, Beaufort?
     Beaufort.&mdash;Ay, as fast
     As words, and hands, and hearts, and priest,
     Could make us.&rdquo;&mdash;BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER: Noble Gentleman.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the parlour of the inn at D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; sat Mr. John Barlow.
      He had just finished his breakfast, and was writing letters and looking
      over papers connected with his various business&mdash;when the door was
      thrown open, and a gentleman entered abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beaufort,&rdquo; said the lawyer rising, &ldquo;Mr. Philip Beaufort&mdash;for
      such I now feel you are by right&mdash;though,&rdquo; he added, with his usual
      formal and quiet smile, &ldquo;not yet by law; and much&mdash;very much, remains
      to be done to make the law and the right the same;&mdash;I congratulate
      you on having something at last to work on. I had begun to despair of
      finding our witness, after a month&rsquo;s advertising; and had commenced other
      investigations, of which I will speak to you presently, when yesterday, on
      my return to town from an errand on your business, I had the pleasure of a
      visit from William Smith himself.&mdash;My dear sir, do not yet be too
      sanguine.&mdash;It seems that this poor fellow, having known misfortune,
      was in America when the first fruitless inquiries were made. Long after
      this he returned to the colony, and there met with a brother, who, as I
      drew from him, was a convict. He helped the brother to escape. They both
      came to England. William learned from a distant relation, who lent him
      some little money, of the inquiry that had been set on foot for him;
      consulted his brother, who desired him to leave all to his management. The
      brother afterwards assured him that you and Mr. Sidney were both dead; and
      it seems (for the witness is simple enough to allow me to extract all)
      this same brother then went to Mr. Beaufort to hold out the threat of a
      lawsuit, and to offer the sale of the evidence yet existing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Beaufort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy to say, seems to have spurned the offer. Meanwhile William,
      incredulous of his brother&rsquo;s report, proceeded to N&mdash;&mdash;, learned
      nothing from Mr. Morton, met his brother again&mdash;and the brother
      (confessing that he had deceived him in the assertion that you and Mr.
      Sidney were dead) told him that he had known you in earlier life, and set
      out to Paris to seek you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Known me?&mdash;To Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More of this presently. William returned to town, living hardly and
      penuriously on the little his brother bestowed on him, too melancholy and
      too poor for the luxury of a newspaper, and never saw our advertisement,
      till, as luck would have it, his money was out; he had heard nothing
      further of his brother, and he went for new assistance to the same
      relation who had before aided him. This relation, to his surprise,
      received the poor man very kindly, lent him what he wanted, and then asked
      him if he had not seen our advertisement. The newspaper shown him
      contained both the advertisements&mdash;that relating to Mr. Morton&rsquo;s
      visitor, that containing his own name. He coupled them both together&mdash;called
      on me at once. I was from town on your business. He returned to his own
      home; the next morning (yesterday morning) came a letter from his brother,
      which I obtained from him at last, and with promises that no harm should
      happen to the writer on account of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont took the letter and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR WILLIAM,&mdash;No go about the youngster I went after: all
      researches in vane. Paris develish expensive. Never mind, I have sene the
      other&mdash;the young B&mdash;; different sort of fellow from his father&mdash;very
      ill&mdash;frightened out of his wits&mdash;will go off to the governor,
      take me with him as far as Bullone. I think we shall settel it now. Mind
      as I saide before, don&rsquo;t put your foot in it. I send you a Nap in the
      Seele&mdash;all I can spare.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;Yours,
                  &ldquo;JEREMIAH SMITH.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Direct to me, Monsieur Smith&mdash;always a safe name&mdash;Ship Inn,
      Bullone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeremiah&mdash;Smith&mdash;Jeremiah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the name then?&rdquo; said Mr. Barlow. &ldquo;Well; the poor man owns
      that he was frightened at his brother&mdash;that he wished to do what is
      right&mdash;that he feared his brother would not let him&mdash;that your
      father was very kind to him&mdash;and so he came off at once to me; and I
      was very luckily at home to assure him that the heir was alive, and
      prepared to assert his rights. Now then, Mr. Beaufort, we have the
      witness, but will that suffice us? I fear not. Will the jury believe him
      with no other testimony at his back? Consider!&mdash;When he was gone I
      put myself in communication with some officers at Bow Street about this
      brother of his&mdash;a most notorious character, commonly called in the
      police slang Dashing Jerry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Well, proceed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your one witness, then, is a very poor, penniless man, his brother a
      rogue, a convict: this witness, too, is the most timid, fluctuating,
      irresolute fellow I ever saw; I should tremble for his testimony against a
      sharp, bullying lawyer. And that, sir, is all at present we have to look
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&mdash;I see. It is dangerous&mdash;it is hazardous. But truth is
      truth; justice&mdash;justice! I will run the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, if I ask, did you ever know this brother?&mdash;were you ever
      absolutely acquainted with him&mdash;in the same house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many years since&mdash;years of early hardship and trial&mdash;I was
      acquainted with him&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear it,&rdquo; and the lawyer looked grave. &ldquo;Do you not see that
      if this witness is browbeat&mdash;is disbelieved, and if it be shown that
      you, the claimant, was&mdash;forgive my saying it&mdash;intimate with a
      brother of such a character, why the whole thing might be made to look
      like perjury and conspiracy. If we stop here it is an ugly business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is this all you have to say to me? The witness is found&mdash;the
      only surviving witness&mdash;the only proof I ever shall or ever can
      obtain, and you seek to terrify me&mdash;me too&mdash;from using the means
      for redress Providence itself vouchsafes me&mdash;Sir, I will not hear
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beaufort, you are impatient&mdash;it is natural. But if we go to law&mdash;that
      is, should I have anything to do with it, wait&mdash;wait till your case
      is good. And hear me yet. This is not the only proof&mdash;this is not the
      only witness; you forget that there was an examined copy of the register;
      we may yet find that copy, and the person who copied it may yet be alive
      to attest it. Occupied with this thought, and weary of waiting the result
      of our advertisement, I resolved to go into the neighbourhood of Fernside;
      luckily, there was a gentleman&rsquo;s seat to be sold in the village. I made
      the survey of this place my apparent business. After going over the house,
      I appeared anxious to see how far some alterations could be made&mdash;alterations
      to render it more like Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s villa. This led me to request a
      sight of that villa&mdash;a crown to the housekeeper got me admittance.
      The housekeeper had lived with your father, and been retained by his
      lordship. I soon, therefore, knew which were the rooms the late Mr.
      Beaufort had principally occupied; shown into his study, where it was
      probable he would keep his papers, I inquired if it were the same
      furniture (which seemed likely enough from its age and fashion) as in your
      father&rsquo;s time: it was so; Lord Lilburne had bought the house just as it
      stood, and, save a few additions in the drawing-room, the general
      equipment of the villa remained unaltered. You look impatient!&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      coming to the point. My eye fell upon an old-fashioned bureau&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we searched every drawer in that bureau!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any secret drawers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Secret drawers! No! there were no secret drawers that I ever heard of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barlow rubbed his hands and mused a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was struck with that bureau; for any father had had one like it. It is
      not English&mdash;it is of Dutch manufacture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have heard that my father bought it at a sale, three or four years
      after his marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I learned this from the housekeeper, who was flattered by my admiring it.
      I could not find out from her at what sale it had been purchased, but it
      was in the neighbourhood she was sure. I had now a date to go upon; I
      learned, by careless inquiries, what sales near Fernside had taken place
      in a certain year. A gentleman had died at that date whose furniture was
      sold by auction. With great difficulty, I found that his widow was still
      alive, living far up the country: I paid her a visit; and, not to fatigue
      you with too long an account, I have only to say that she not only assured
      me that she perfectly remembered the bureau, but that it had secret
      drawers and wells, very curiously contrived; nay, she showed me the very
      catalogue in which the said receptacles are noticed in capitals, to arrest
      the eye of the bidder, and increase the price of the bidding. That your
      father should never have revealed where he stowed this document is natural
      enough, during the life of his uncle; his own life was not spared long
      enough to give him much opportunity to explain afterwards, but I feel
      perfectly persuaded in my mind&mdash;that unless Mr. Robert Beaufort
      discovered that paper amongst the others he examined&mdash;in one of those
      drawers will be found all we want to substantiate your claims. This is the
      more likely from your father never mentioning, even to your mother
      apparently, the secret receptacles in the bureau. Why else such mystery?
      The probability is that he received the document either just before or at
      the time he purchased the bureau, or that he bought it for that very
      purpose: and, having once deposited the paper in a place he deemed secure
      from curiosity&mdash;accident, carelessness, policy, perhaps, rather shame
      itself (pardon me) for the doubt of your mother&rsquo;s discretion, that his
      secrecy seemed to imply, kept him from ever alluding to the circumstance,
      even when the intimacy of after years made him more assured of your
      mother&rsquo;s self-sacrificing devotion to his interests. At his uncle&rsquo;s death
      he thought to repair all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how, if that be true&mdash;if that Heaven which has delivered me
      hitherto from so many dangers, has, in the very secrecy of my poor father,
      saved my birthright front the gripe of the usurper&mdash;how, I say, is&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bureau to pass into our possession? That is the difficulty. But we
      must contrive it somehow, if all else fail us; meanwhile, as I now feel
      sure that there has been a copy of that register made, I wish to know
      whether I should not immediately cross the country into Wales, and see if
      I can find any person in the neighbourhood of A&mdash;&mdash;- who did
      examine the copy taken: for, mark you, the said copy is only of importance
      as leading to the testimony of the actual witness who took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Vaudemont, heartily shaking Mr. Barlow by the hand, &ldquo;forgive
      my first petulance. I see in you the very man I desired and wanted&mdash;your
      acuteness surprises and encourages me. Go to Wales, and God speed you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&mdash;in five minutes I shall be off. Meanwhile, see the
      witness yourself; the sight of his benefactor&rsquo;s son will do more to keep
      him steady than anything else. There&rsquo;s his address, and take care not to
      give him money. And now I will order my chaise&mdash;the matter begins to
      look worth expense. Oh! I forgot to say that Monsieur Liancourt called on
      you yesterday about his own affairs. He wishes much to consult you. I told
      him you would probably be this evening in town, and he said he would wait
      you at your lodging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I will lose not a moment in going to London, and visiting our
      witness. And he saw my mother at the altar! My poor mother&mdash;Ah, how
      could my father have doubted her!&rdquo; and as he spoke, he blushed for the
      first time with shame at that father&rsquo;s memory. He could not yet conceive
      that one so frank, one usually so bold and open, could for years have
      preserved from the woman who had sacrificed all to him, a secret to her so
      important! That was, in fact, the only blot on his father&rsquo;s honour&mdash;a
      foul and grave blot it was. Heavily had the punishment fallen on those
      whom the father loved best! Alas, Philip had not yet learned what terrible
      corrupters are the Hope and the Fear of immense Wealthy, even to men
      reputed the most honourable, if they have been reared and pampered in the
      belief that wealth is the Arch blessing of life. Rightly considered, in
      Philip Beaufort&rsquo;s solitary meanness lay the vast moral of this world&rsquo;s
      darkest truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barlow was gone. Philip was about to enter his own chaise, when a
      dormeuse-and-four drove up to the inn-door to change horses. A young man
      was reclining, at his length, in the carriage, wrapped in cloaks, and with
      a ghastly paleness&mdash;the paleness of long and deep disease upon his
      cheeks. He turned his dim eye with, perhaps, a glance of the sick man&rsquo;s
      envy on that strong and athletic, form, majestic with health and vigour,
      as it stood beside the more humble vehicle. Philip did not, however,
      notice the new arrival; he sprang into the chaise, it rattled on, and
      thus, unconsciously, Arthur Beaufort and his cousin had again met. To
      which was now the Night&mdash;to which the Morning?

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Bakam. Let my men guard the walls.
     Syana. And mine the temple.&rdquo;&mdash;The Island Princess.
</pre>
    <p>
      While thus eventfully the days and the weeks had passed for Philip, no
      less eventfully, so far as the inner life is concerned, had they glided
      away for Fanny. She had feasted in quiet and delighted thought on the
      consciousness that she was improving&mdash;that she was growing worthier
      of him&mdash;that he would perceive it on his return. Her manner was more
      thoughtful, more collected&mdash;less childish, in short, than it had
      been. And yet, with all the stir and flutter of the aroused intellect, the
      charm of her strange innocence was not scared away. She rejoiced in the
      ancient liberty she had regained of going out and coming back when she
      pleased; and as the weather was too cold ever to tempt Simon from his
      fireside, except, perhaps, for half-an-hour in the forenoon, so the hours
      of dusk, when he least missed her, were those which she chiefly
      appropriated for stealing away to the good school-mistress, and growing
      wiser and wiser every day in the ways of God and the learning of His
      creatures. The schoolmistress was not a brilliant woman. Nor was it
      accomplishments of which Fanny stood in need, so much as the opening of
      her thoughts and mind by profitable books and rational conversation.
      Beautiful as were all her natural feelings, the schoolmistress had now
      little difficulty in educating feelings up to the dignity of principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, hitherto patient under the absence of one never absent from her
      heart, Fanny received from him the letter he had addressed to her two days
      before he quitted Beaufort Court;&mdash;another letter&mdash;a second
      letter&mdash;a letter to excuse himself for not coming before&mdash;a
      letter that gave her an address that asked for a reply. It was a morning
      of unequalled delight approaching to transport. And then the excitement of
      answering the letter&mdash;the pride of showing how she was improved, what
      an excellent hand she now wrote! She shut herself up in her room: she did
      not go out that day. She placed the paper before her, and, to her
      astonishment, all that she had to say vanished from her mind at once. How
      was she even to begin? She had always hitherto called him &ldquo;Brother.&rdquo; Ever
      since her conversation with Sarah she felt that she could not call him
      that name again for the world&mdash;no, never! But what should she call
      him&mdash;what could she call him? He signed himself &ldquo;Philip.&rdquo; She knew
      that was his name. She thought it a musical name to utter, but to write
      it! No! some instinct she could not account for seemed to whisper that it
      was improper&mdash;presumptuous, to call him &ldquo;Dear Philip.&rdquo; Had Burns&rsquo;s
      songs&mdash;the songs that unthinkingly he had put into her hand, and told
      her to read&mdash;songs that comprise the most beautiful love-poems in the
      world&mdash;had they helped to teach her some of the secrets of her own
      heart? And had timidity come with knowledge? Who shall say&mdash;who guess
      what passed within her? Nor did Fanny herself, perhaps, know her own
      feelings: but write the words &ldquo;Dear Philip&rdquo; she could not. And the whole
      of that day, though she thought of nothing else, she could not even get
      through the first line to her satisfaction. The next morning she sat down
      again. It would be so unkind if she did not answer immediately: she must
      answer. She placed his letter before her&mdash;she resolutely began. But
      copy after copy was made and torn. And Simon wanted her&mdash;and Sarah
      wanted her&mdash;and there were bills to be paid; and dinner was over
      before her task was really begun. But after dinner she began in good
      earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind in you to write to me&rdquo; (the difficulty of any name was dispensed
      with by adopting none), &ldquo;and to wish to know about my dear grandfather! He
      is much the same, but hardly ever walks out now, and I have had a good
      deal of time to myself. I think something will surprise you, and make you
      smile, as you used to do at first, when you come back. You must not be
      angry with me that I have gone out by myself very often&mdash;every day,
      indeed. I have been so safe. Nobody has ever offered to be rude again to
      Fanny&rdquo; (the word &ldquo;Fanny&rdquo; was carefully scratched out with a penknife, and
      me substituted). &ldquo;But you shall know all when you come. And are you sure
      you are well&mdash;quite&mdash;quite well? Do you never have the headaches
      you complained of sometimes? Do say this! Do you walk out-every day? Is
      there any pretty churchyard near you now? Whom do you walk with?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been so happy in putting the flowers on the two graves. But I
      still give yours the prettiest, though the other is so dear to me. I feel
      sad when I come to the last, but not when I look at the one I have looked
      at so long. Oh, how good you were! But you don&rsquo;t like me to thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very stupid!&rdquo; cried Fanny, suddenly throwing down her pen; &ldquo;and I
      don&rsquo;t think I am improved at it;&rdquo; and she half cried with vexation.
      Suddenly a bright idea crossed her. In the little parlour where the
      schoolmistress privately received her, she had seen among the books, and
      thought at the time how useful it might be to her if ever she had to write
      to Philip, a little volume entitled, The Complete Letter Writer. She knew
      by the title-page that it contained models for every description of letter&mdash;no
      doubt it would contain the precise thing that would suit the present
      occasion. She started up at the notion. She would go&mdash;she could be
      back to finish the letter before post-time. She put on her bonnet&mdash;left
      the letter, in her haste, open on the table&mdash;and just looking into
      the parlour in her way to the street door, to convince herself that Simon
      was asleep, and the wire-guard was on the fire, she hurried to the kind
      schoolmistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the fogs that in autumn gather sullenly over London and its suburbs
      covered the declining day with premature dimness. It grew darker and
      darker as she proceeded, but she reached the house in safety. She spent a
      quarter of an hour in timidly consulting her friend about all kinds of
      letters except the identical one that she intended to write, and having
      had it strongly impressed on her mind that if the letter was to a
      gentleman at all genteel, she ought to begin &ldquo;Dear Sir,&rdquo; and end with &ldquo;I
      have the honour to remain;&rdquo; and that he would be everlastingly offended if
      she did not in the address affix &ldquo;Esquire&rdquo; to his name (that, was a great
      discovery),&mdash;she carried off the precious volume, and quitted the
      house. There was a wall that, bounding the demesnes of the school, ran for
      some short distance into the main street. The increasing fog, here,
      faintly struggled against the glimmer of a single lamp at some little
      distance. Just in this spot, her eye was caught by a dark object in the
      road, which she could scarcely perceive to be a carriage, when her hand
      was seized, and a voice said in her ear:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you will not be so cruel to me, I hope, as you were to my messenger!
      I have come myself for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned in great alarm, but the darkness prevented her recognising the
      face of him who thus accosted her. &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she cried,&mdash;&ldquo;let me
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! No&mdash;no. Come with me. You shall have a house&mdash;carriage&mdash;servants!
      You shall wear silk gowns and jewels! You shall be a great lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As these various temptations succeeded in rapid course each new struggle
      of Fanny, a voice from the coach-box said in a low tone,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, my lord, I see somebody coming&mdash;perhaps a policeman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny heard the caution, and screamed for rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; muttered the molester. And suddenly Fanny felt her voice
      checked&mdash;her head mantled&mdash;her light form lifted from the
      ground. She clung&mdash;she struggled it was in vain. It was the affair of
      a moment: she felt herself borne into the carriage&mdash;the door closed&mdash;the
      stranger was by her side, and his voice said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive on, Dykeman. Fast! fast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two or three minutes, which seemed to her terror as ages, elapsed, when
      the gag and the mantle were gently removed, and the same voice (she still
      could not see her companion) said in a very mild tone:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not alarm yourself; there is no cause,&mdash;indeed there is not. I
      would not have adopted this plan had there been any other&mdash;any
      gentler one. But I could not call at your own house&mdash;I knew no other
      where to meet you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the only course left to me&mdash;indeed it was. I made myself
      acquainted with your movements. Do not blame me, then, for prying into
      your footsteps. I watched for you all last night&mdash;you did not come
      out. I was in despair. At last I find you. Do not be so terrified: I will
      not even touch your hand if you do not wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, however, he attempted to touch it, and was repulsed with an
      energy that rather disconcerted him. The poor girl recoiled from him into
      the farthest corner of that prison in speechless horror&mdash;in the
      darkest confusion of ideas. She did not weep&mdash;she did not sob&mdash;but
      her trembling seemed to shake the very carriage. The man continued to
      address, to expostulate, to pray, to soothe.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner was respectful. His protestations that he would not harm her
      for the world were endless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only just see the home I can give you; for two days&mdash;for one day.
      Only just hear how rich I can make you and your grandfather, and then if
      you wish to leave me, you shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More, much more, to this effect, did he continue to pour forth, without
      extracting any sound from Fanny but gasps as for breath, and now and then
      a low murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, let me go! My grandfather, my blind grandfather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And finally tears came to her relief, and she sobbed with a passion that
      alarmed, and perhaps even touched her companion, cynical and icy as he
      was. Meanwhile the carriage seemed to fly. Fast as two horses,
      thorough-bred, and almost at full speed, could go, they were whirled
      along, till about an hour, or even less, from the time in which she had
      been thus captured, the carriage stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we here already?&rdquo; said the man, putting his head out of the window.
      &ldquo;Do then as I told you. Not to the front door; to my study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In two minutes more the carriage halted again, before a building which
      looked white and ghostlike through the mist. The driver dismounted, opened
      with a latch-key a window-door, entered for a moment to light the candles
      in a solitary room from a fire that blazed on the hearth, reappeared, and
      opened the carriage-door. It was with a difficulty for which they were
      scarcely prepared that they were enabled to get Fanny from the carriage.
      No soft words, no whispered prayers could draw her forth; and it was with
      no trifling address, for her companion sought to be as gentle as the force
      necessary to employ would allow, that he disengaged her hands from the
      window-frame, the lining, the cushions, to which they clung; and at last
      bore her into the house. The driver closed the window again as he
      retreated, and they were alone. Fanny then cast a wild, scarce conscious
      glance over the apartment. It was small and simply furnished. Opposite to
      her was an old-fashioned bureau, one of those quaint, elaborate monuments
      of Dutch ingenuity, which, during the present century, the audacious
      spirit of curiosity-vendors has transplanted from their native
      receptacles, to contrast, with grotesque strangeness, the neat handiwork
      of Gillow and Seddon. It had a physiognomy and character of its own&mdash;this
      fantastic foreigner! Inlaid with mosaics, depicting landscapes and
      animals; graceless in form and fashion, but still picturesque, and winning
      admiration, when more closely observed, from the patient defiance of all
      rules of taste which had formed its cumbrous parts into one profusely
      ornamented and eccentric whole. It was the more noticeable from its total
      want of harmony with the other appurtenances of the room, which bespoke
      the tastes of the plain English squire. Prints of horses and hunts,
      fishing-rods and fowling-pieces, carefully suspended, decorated the walls.
      Not, however, on this notable stranger from the sluggish land rested the
      eye of Fanny. That, in her hurried survey, was arrested only by a portrait
      placed over the bureau&mdash;the portrait of a female in the bloom of
      life; a face so fair, a brow so candid, and eyes so pure, a lip so rich in
      youth and joy&mdash;that as her look lingered on the features Fanny felt
      comforted, felt as if some living protectress were there. The fire burned
      bright and merrily; a table, spread as for dinner, was drawn near it. To
      any other eye but Fanny&rsquo;s the place would have seemed a picture of English
      comfort. At last her looks rested on her companion. He had thrown himself,
      with a long sigh, partly of fatigue, partly of satisfaction, on one of the
      chairs, and was contemplating her as she thus stood and gazed, with an
      expression of mingled curiosity and admiration; she recognised at once her
      first, her only persecutor. She recoiled, and covered her face with her
      hands. The man approached her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not hate me, Fanny,&mdash;do not turn away. Believe me, though I have
      acted thus violently, here all violence will cease. I love you, but I will
      not be satisfied till you love me in return. I am not young, and I am not
      handsome, but I am rich and great, and I can make those whom I love happy,&mdash;so
      happy, Fanny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fanny had turned away, and was now busily employed in trying to
      re-open the door at which she had entered. Failing in this, she suddenly
      darted away, opened the inner door, and rushed into the passage with a
      loud cry. Her persecutor stifled an oath, and sprung after and arrested
      her. He now spoke sternly, and with a smile and a frown at once:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is folly;&mdash;come back, or you will repent it! I have promised
      you, as a gentleman&mdash;as a nobleman, if you know what that is&mdash;to
      respect you. But neither will I myself be trifled with nor insulted. There
      must be no screams!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His look and his voice awed Fanny in spite of her bewilderment and her
      loathing, and she suffered herself passively to be drawn into the room. He
      closed and bolted the door. She threw herself on the ground in one corner,
      and moaned low but piteously. He looked at her musingly for some moments,
      as he stood by the fire, and at last went to the door, opened it, and
      called &ldquo;Harriet&rdquo; in a low voice. Presently a young woman, of about thirty,
      appeared, neatly but plainly dressed, and of a countenance that, if not
      very winning, might certainly be called very handsome. He drew her aside
      for a few moments, and a whispered conference was exchanged. He then
      walked gravely up to Fanny &ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I see my presence
      is too much for you this evening. This young woman will attend you&mdash;will
      get you all you want. She can tell you, too, that I am not the terrible
      sort of person you seem to suppose. I shall see you to-morrow.&rdquo; So saying,
      he turned on his heel and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny felt something like liberty, something like joy, again. She rose,
      and looked so pleadingly, so earnestly, so intently into the woman&rsquo;s face,
      that Harriet turned away her bold eyes abashed; and at this moment Dykeman
      himself looked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to bring us in dinner here yourself, uncle; and then go to my
      lord in the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dykeman looked pleased, and vanished. Then Harriet came up and took
      Fanny&rsquo;s hand, and said, kindly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened. I assure you, half the girls in London would give I
      don&rsquo;t know what to be in your place. My lord never will force you to do
      anything you don&rsquo;t like&mdash;it&rsquo;s not his way; and he&rsquo;s the kindest and
      best man,&mdash;and so rich; he does not know what to do with his money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To all this Fanny made but one answer,&mdash;she threw herself suddenly
      upon the woman&rsquo;s breast, and sobbed out: &ldquo;My grandfather is blind, he
      cannot do without me&mdash;he will die&mdash;die. Have you nobody you
      love, too? Let me go&mdash;let me out! What can they want with me?&mdash;I
      never did harm to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one will harm you;&mdash;I swear it!&rdquo; said Harriet, earnestly. &ldquo;I
      see you don&rsquo;t know my lord. But here&rsquo;s the dinner; come, and take a bit of
      something, and a glass of wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny could not touch anything except a glass of water, and that nearly
      choked her. But at last, as she recovered her senses, the absence of her
      tormentor&mdash;the presence of a woman&mdash;the solemn assurances of
      Harriet that, if she did not like to stay there, after a day or two, she
      should go back, tranquillised her in some measure. She did not heed the
      artful and lengthened eulogiums that the she-tempter then proceeded to
      pour forth upon the virtues, and the love, and the generosity, and, above
      all, the money of my lord. She only kept repeating to herself, &ldquo;I shall go
      back in a day or two.&rdquo; At length, Harriet, having eaten and drunk as much
      as she could by her single self, and growing wearied with efforts from
      which so little resulted, proposed to Fanny to retire to rest. She opened
      a door to the right of the fireplace, and lighted her up a winding
      staircase to a pretty and comfortable chamber, where she offered to help
      her to undress. Fanny&rsquo;s complete innocence, and her utter ignorance of the
      precise nature of the danger that awaited her, though she fancied it must
      be very great and very awful, prevented her quite comprehending all that
      Harriet meant to convey by her solemn assurances that she should not be
      disturbed. But she understood, at least, that she was not to see her
      hateful gaoler till the next morning; and when Harriet, wishing her &ldquo;good
      night,&rdquo; showed her a bolt to her door, she was less terrified at the
      thought of being alone in that strange place. She listened till Harriet&rsquo;s
      footsteps had died away, and then, with a beating heart, tried to open the
      door; it was locked from without. She sighed heavily. The window?&mdash;alas!
      when she had removed the shutter, there was another one barred from
      without, which precluded all hope there; she had no help for it but to
      bolt her door, stand forlorn and amazed at her own condition, and, at
      last, falling on her knees, to pray, in her own simple fashion, which
      since her recent visits to the schoolmistress had become more intelligent
      and earnest, to Him from whom no bolts and no bars can exclude the voice
      of the human heart.

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;In te omnis domus inclinata recumbit.&rdquo;&mdash;VIRGIL.

      [On thee the whole house rests confidingly.]
</pre>
    <p>
      Lord Lilburne, seated before a tray in the drawing-room, was finishing his
      own solitary dinner, and Dykeman was standing close behind him, nervous
      and agitated. The confidence of many years between the master and the
      servant&mdash;the peculiar mind of Lilburne, which excluded him from all
      friendship with his own equals&mdash;had established between the two the
      kind of intimacy so common with the noble and the valet of the old French
      regime, and indeed, in much Lilburne more resembled the men of that day
      and land, than he did the nobler and statelier being which belongs to our
      own. But to the end of time, whatever is at once vicious, polished, and
      intellectual, will have a common likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my lord,&rdquo; said Dykeman, &ldquo;just reflect. This girl is so well known in
      the place; she will be sure to be missed; and if any violence is done to
      her, it&rsquo;s a capital crime, my lord&mdash;a capital crime. I know they
      can&rsquo;t hang a great lord like you, but all concerned in it may&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lilburne interrupted the speaker by, &ldquo;Give me some wine and hold your
      tongue!&rdquo; Then, when he had emptied his glass, he drew himself nearer to
      the fire, warmed his hands, mused a moment, and turned round to his
      confidant:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dykeman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though you&rsquo;re an ass and a coward, and you don&rsquo;t
      deserve that I should be so condescending, I will relieve your fears at
      once. I know the law better than you can, for my whole life has been spent
      in doing exactly as I please, without ever putting myself in the power of
      LAW, which interferes with the pleasures of other men. You are right in
      saying violence would be a capital crime. Now the difference between vice
      and crime is this: Vice is what parsons write sermons against, Crime is
      what we make laws against. I never committed a crime in all my life,&mdash;at
      an age between fifty and sixty&mdash;I am not going to begin. Vices are
      safe things; I may have my vices like other men: but crimes are dangerous
      things&mdash;illegal things&mdash;things to be carefully avoided. Look
      you&rdquo; (and here the speaker, fixing his puzzled listener with his eye,
      broke into a grin of sublime mockery), &ldquo;let me suppose you to be the World&mdash;that
      cringing valet of valets, the WORLD! I should say to you this, &lsquo;My dear
      World, you and I understand each other well,&mdash;we are made for each
      other,&mdash;I never come in your way, nor you in mine. If I get drunk
      every day in my own room, that&rsquo;s vice, you can&rsquo;t touch me; if I take an
      extra glass for the first time in my life, and knock down the watchman,
      that&rsquo;s a crime which, if I am rich, costs me one pound&mdash;perhaps five
      pounds; if I am poor, sends me to the treadmill. If I break the hearts of
      five hundred old fathers, by buying with gold or flattery the embraces of
      five hundred young daughters, that&rsquo;s vice,&mdash;your servant, Mr. World!
      If one termagant wench scratches my face, makes a noise, and goes
      brazen-faced to the Old Bailey to swear to her shame, why that&rsquo;s crime,
      and my friend, Mr. World, pulls a hemp-rope out of his pocket.&rsquo; Now, do
      you understand? Yes, I repeat,&rdquo; he added, with a change of voice, &ldquo;I never
      committed a crime in my life,&mdash;I have never even been accused of one,&mdash;never
      had an action of crim. con.&mdash;of seduction against me. I know how to
      manage such matters better. I was forced to carry off this girl, because I
      had no other means of courting her. To court her is all I mean to do now.
      I am perfectly aware that an action for violence, as you call it, would be
      the more disagreeable, because of the very weakness of intellect which the
      girl is said to possess, and of which report I don&rsquo;t believe a word. I
      shall most certainly avoid even the remotest appearance that could be so
      construed. It is for that reason that no one in the house shall attend the
      girl except yourself and your niece. Your niece I can depend on, I know; I
      have been kind to her; I have got her a good husband; I shall get her
      husband a good place;&mdash;I shall be godfather to her first child. To be
      sure, the other servants will know there&rsquo;s a lady in the house, but to
      that they are accustomed; I don&rsquo;t set up for a Joseph. They need know no
      more, unless you choose to blab it out. Well, then, supposing that at the
      end of a few days, more or less, without any rudeness on my part, a young
      woman, after seeing a few jewels, and fine dresses, and a pretty house,
      and being made very comfortable, and being convinced that her grandfather
      shall be taken care of without her slaving herself to death, chooses of
      her own accord to live with me, where&rsquo;s the crime, and who can interfere
      with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, my lord, that alters the case,&rdquo; said Dykeman, considerably
      relieved. &ldquo;But still,&rdquo; he added, anxiously, &ldquo;if the inquiry is made,&mdash;if
      before all this is settled, it is found out where she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then no harm will be done&mdash;no violence will be committed. Her
      grandfather,&mdash;drivelling and a miser, you say&mdash;can be appeased
      by a little money, and it will be nobody&rsquo;s business, and no case can be
      made of it. Tush! man! I always look before I leap! People in this world
      are not so charitable as you suppose. What more natural than that a poor
      and pretty girl&mdash;not as wise as Queen Elizabeth&mdash;should be
      tempted to pay a visit to a rich lover!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All they can say of the lover is, that he is a very gay man or a very bad
      man, and that&rsquo;s saying nothing new of me. But don&rsquo;t think it will be found
      out. Just get me that stool; this has been a very troublesome piece of
      business&mdash;rather tried me. I am not so young as I was. Yes, Dykeman,
      something which that Frenchman Vaudemont, or Vautrien, or whatever his
      name is, said to me once, has a certain degree of truth. I felt it in the
      last fit of the gout, when my pretty niece was smoothing my pillows. A
      nurse, as we grow older, may be of use to one. I wish to make this girl
      like me, or be grateful to me. I am meditating a longer and more serious
      attachment than usual,&mdash;a companion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A companion, my lord, in that poor creature!&mdash;so ignorant&mdash;so
      uneducated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. This world palls upon me,&rdquo; said Lilburne, almost
      gloomily. &ldquo;I grow sick of the miserable quackeries&mdash;of the piteous
      conceits that men, women, and children call &lsquo;knowledge,&rsquo; I wish to catch a
      glimpse of nature before I die. This creature interests me, and that is
      something in this life. Clear those things away, and leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; muttered Lilburne, as he bent over the fire alone, &ldquo;when I first
      heard that that girl was the granddaughter of Simon Gawtrey, and,
      therefore, the child of the man whom I am to thank that I am a cripple, I
      felt as if love to her were a part of that hate which I owe to him; a
      segment in the circle of my vengeance. But now, poor child!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget all this. I feel for her, not passion, but what I never felt
      before, affection. I feel that if I had such a child, I could understand
      what men mean when they talk of the tenderness of a father. I have not one
      impure thought for that girl&mdash;not one. But I would give thousands if
      she could love me. Strange! strange! in all this I do not recognise
      myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Lilburne retired to rest betimes that night; he slept sound; rose
      refreshed at an earlier hour than usual; and what he considered a fit of
      vapours of the previous night was passed away. He looked with eagerness to
      an interview with Fanny. Proud of his intellect, pleased in any of those
      sinister exercises of it which the code and habits of his life so long
      permitted to him, he regarded the conquest of his fair adversary with the
      interest of a scientific game. Harriet went to Fanny&rsquo;s room to prepare her
      to receive her host; and Lord Lilburne now resolved to make his own visit
      the less unwelcome by reserving for his especial gift some showy, if not
      valuable, trinkets, which for similar purposes never failed the
      depositories of the villa he had purchased for his pleasures. He,
      recollected that these gewgaws were placed in the bureau in the study; in
      which, as having a lock of foreign and intricate workmanship, he usually
      kept whatever might tempt cupidity in those frequent absences when the
      house was left guarded but by two women servants. Finding that Fanny had
      not yet quitted her own chamber, while Harriet went up to attend and
      reason with her, he himself limped into the study below, unlocked the
      bureau, and was searching in the drawers, when he heard the voice of Fanny
      above, raised a little as if in remonstrance or entreaty; and he paused to
      listen. He could not, however, distinguish what was said; and in the
      meanwhile, without attending much to what he was about, his hands were
      still employed in opening and shutting the drawers, passing through the
      pigeon-holes, and feeling for a topaz brooch, which he thought could not
      fail of pleasing the unsophisticated eyes of Fanny. One of the recesses
      was deeper than the rest; he fancied the brooch was there; he stretched
      his hand into the recess; and, as the room was partially darkened by the
      lower shutters from without, which were still unclosed to prevent any
      attempted escape of his captive, he had only the sense of touch to depend
      on; not finding the brooch, he stretched on till he came to the extremity
      of the recess, and was suddenly sensible of a sharp pain; the flesh seemed
      caught as in a trap; he drew back his finger with sudden force and a
      half-suppressed exclamation, and he perceived the bottom or floor of the
      pigeon-hole recede, as if sliding back. His curiosity was aroused; he
      again felt warily and cautiously, and discovered a very slight inequality
      and roughness at the extremity of the recess. He was aware instantly that
      there was some secret spring; he pressed with some force on the spot, and
      he felt the board give way; he pushed it back towards him, and it slid
      suddenly with a whirring noise, and left a cavity below exposed to his
      sight. He peered in, and drew forth a paper; he opened it at first
      carelessly, for he was still trying to listen to Fanny. His eye ran
      rapidly over a few preliminary lines till it rested on what follows:
    </p>

    <p>
      Lord Lilburne again cast his eye over the lines prefixed to this startling
      document, which, being those written at Caleb&rsquo;s desire, by Mr. Jones to
      Philip Beaufort, we need not here transcribe to the reader. At that
      instant Harriet descended the stairs, and came into the room; she crept up
      on tiptoe to Lilburne, and whispered,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is coming down, I think; she does not know you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;go!&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne. And scarce had Harriet left the
      room, when a carriage drove furiously to the door, and Robert Beaufort
      rushed into the study.

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Gone, and none know it.

   How now?&mdash;What news, what hopes and steps discovered!&rdquo;
    BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER: The Pilgrim.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Philip arrived at his lodgings in town it was very late, but he still
      found Liancourt waiting the chance of his arrival. The Frenchman was full
      of his own schemes and projects. He was a man of high repute and
      connections; negotiations for his recall to Paris had been entered into;
      he was divided between a Quixotic loyalty and a rational prudence; he
      brought his doubts to Vaudemont. Occupied as he was with thoughts of so
      important and personal a nature, Philip could yet listen patiently to his
      friend, and weigh with him the pros and cons. And after having mutually
      agreed that loyalty and prudence would both be best consulted by waiting a
      little, to see if the nation, as the Carlists yet fondly trusted, would
      soon, after its first fever, offer once more the throne and the purple to
      the descendant of St. Louis, Liancourt, as he lighted his cigar to walk
      home, said, &ldquo;A thousand thanks to you, my dear friend: and how have you
      enjoyed yourself in your visit? I am not surprised or jealous that
      Lilburne did not invite me, as I do not play at cards, and as I have said
      some sharp things to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy I shall have the same disqualifications for another invitation,&rdquo;
       said Vaudemont, with a severe smile. &ldquo;I may have much to disclose to you
      in a few days. At present my news is still unripe. And have you seen
      anything of Lilburne? He left us some days since. Is he in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I was riding with our friend Henri, who wished to try a new horse
      off the stones, a little way into the country yesterday. We went through&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and
      H&mdash;&mdash;. Pretty places, those. Do you know them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know H&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just at dusk, as we were spurring back to town, whom should I see
      walking on the path of the high-road but Lord Lilburne himself! I could
      hardly believe my eyes. I stopped, and, after asking him about you, I
      could not help expressing my surprise to see him on foot at such a place.
      You know the man&rsquo;s sneer. &lsquo;A Frenchman so gallant as Monsieur de
      Liancourt,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;need not be surprised at much greater miracles; the
      iron moves to the magnet: I have a little adventure here. Pardon me if I
      ask you to ride on.&rsquo; Of course I wished him good day; and a little farther
      up the road I saw a dark plain chariot, no coronet, no arms, no footman
      only the man on the box, but the beauty of the horses assured me it must
      belong to Lilburne. Can you conceive such absurdity in a man of that age&mdash;and
      a very clever fellow too? Yet, how is it that one does not ridicule it in
      Lilburne, as one would in another man between fifty and sixty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because one does not ridicule,&mdash;one loathes-him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that&rsquo;s not it. The fact is that one can&rsquo;t fancy Lilburne old. His
      manner is young&mdash;his eye is young. I never saw any one with so much
      vitality. &lsquo;The bad heart and the good digestion&rsquo;&mdash;the twin secrets
      for wearing well, eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you meet him&mdash;not near H&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; close by. Why? Have you any adventure there too? Nay, forgive me; it
      was but a jest. Good night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaudemont fell into an uneasy reverie: he could not divine exactly why he
      should be alarmed; but he was alarmed at Lilburne being in the
      neighbourhood of H&mdash;&mdash;. It was the foot of the profane violating
      the sanctuary. An undefined thrill shot through him, as his mind coupled
      together the associations of Lilburne and Fanny; but there was no ground
      for forebodings. Fanny did not stir out alone. An adventure, too&mdash;pooh!
      Lord Lilburne must be awaiting a willing and voluntary appointment, most
      probably from some one of the fair but decorous frailties of London. Lord
      Lilburne&rsquo;s more recent conquests were said to be among those of his own
      rank; suburbs are useful for such assignations. Any other thought was too
      horrible to be contemplated. He glanced to the clock; it was three in the
      morning. He would go to H&mdash;&mdash; early, even before he sought out
      Mr. William Smith. With that resolution, and even his hardy frame worn out
      by the excitement of the day, he threw himself on his bed and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wake till near nine, and had just dressed, and hurried over his
      abstemious breakfast, when the servant of the house came to tell him that
      an old woman, apparently in great agitation, wished to see him. His head
      was still full of witnesses and lawsuits; and he was vaguely expecting
      some visitor connected with his primary objects, when Sarah broke into the
      room. She cast a hurried, suspicious look round her, and then throwing
      herself on her knees to him, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if you have taken that poor
      young thing away, God forgive you. Let her come back again. It shall be
      all hushed up. Don&rsquo;t ruin her! don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s a dear good gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak plainly, woman&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; cried Philip, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few words sufficed for an explanation: Fanny&rsquo;s disappearance the
      previous night; the alarm of Sarah at her non-return; the apathy of old
      Simon, who did not comprehend what had happened, and quietly went to bed;
      the search Sarah had made during half the night; the intelligence she had
      picked up, that the policeman, going his rounds, had heard a female shriek
      near the school; but that all he could perceive through the mist was a
      carriage driving rapidly past him; Sarah&rsquo;s suspicions of Vaudemont
      confirmed in the morning, when, entering Fanny&rsquo;s room, she perceived the
      poor girl&rsquo;s unfinished letter with his own, the clue to his address that
      the letter gave her; all this, ere she well understood what she herself
      was talking about,&mdash;Vaudemont&rsquo;s alarm seized, and the reflection of a
      moment construed: the carriage; Lilburne seen lurking in the neighbourhood
      the previous day; the former attempt;&mdash;all flashed on him with an
      intolerable glare. While Sarah was yet speaking, he rushed from the house,
      he flew to Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s in Park Lane; he composed his manner, he
      inquired calmly. His lordship had slept from home; he was, they believed,
      at Fernside: Fernside! H&mdash;&mdash; was on the direct way to that
      villa. Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed since he heard the story ere he
      was on the road, with such speed as the promise of a guinea a mile could
      extract from the spurs of a young post-boy applied to the flanks of London
      post-horses.

      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Ex humili magna ad fastigia rerum
          Extollit.&rdquo;&mdash;JUVENAL.

        [Fortune raises men from low estate to the very
        summit of prosperity.]
</pre>
    <p>
      When Harriet had quitted Fanny, the waiting-woman, craftily wishing to
      lure her into Lilburne&rsquo;s presence, had told her that the room below was
      empty; and the captive&rsquo;s mind naturally and instantly seized on the
      thought of escape. After a brief breathing pause, she crept noiselessly
      down the stairs, and gently opened the door; and at the very instant she
      did so, Robert Beaufort entered from the other door; she drew back in
      terror, when, what was her astonishment in hearing a name uttered that
      spell-bound her&mdash;the last name she could have expected to hear; for
      Lilburne, the instant he saw Beaufort, pale, haggard, agitated, rush into
      the room, and bang the door after him, could only suppose that something
      of extraordinary moment had occurred with regard to the dreaded guest, and
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come about Vaudemont! Something has happened about Vaudemont! about
      Philip! What is it? Calm yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, as the name was thus abruptly uttered, actually thrust her face
      through the door; but she again drew back, and, all her senses
      preternaturally quickened at that name, while she held the door almost
      closed, listened with her whole soul in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces of both the men were turned from her, and her partial entry had
      not been perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Robert Beaufort, leaning his weight, as if ready to sink to
      the ground, upon Lilburne&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;Yes; Vaudemont, or Philip, for they
      are one,&mdash;yes, it is about that man I have come to consult you.
      Arthur has arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Arthur has seen the wretch who visited us, and the rascal&rsquo;s manner
      has so imposed on him, so convinced him that Philip is the heir to all our
      property, that he has come over-ill, ill&mdash;I fear&rdquo; (added Beaufort, in
      a hollow voice), &ldquo;dying, to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To guard against their machinations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no&mdash;to say that if such be the case, neither honour nor
      conscience will allow us to resist his rights. He is so obstinate in this
      matter; his nerves so ill bear reasoning and contradiction, that I know
      not what to do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take breath&mdash;go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it seems that this man found out Arthur almost as soon as my son
      arrived at Paris&mdash;that he has persuaded Arthur that he has it in his
      power to prove the marriage&mdash;that he pretended to be very impatient
      for a decision&mdash;that Arthur, in order to gain time to see me,
      affected irresolution&mdash;took him to Boulogne, for the rascal does not
      dare to return to England&mdash;left him there; and now comes back, my own
      son, as my worst enemy, to conspire against me for my property! I could
      not have kept my temper if I had stayed. But that&rsquo;s not all&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      not the worst: Vaudemont left me suddenly in the morning on the receipt of
      a letter. In taking leave of Camilla he let fall hints which fill me with
      fear. Well, I inquired his movements as I came along; he had stopped at D&mdash;&mdash;,
      had been closeted for above an hour with a man whose name the landlord of
      the inn knew, for it was on his carpet-bag&mdash;the name was Barlow. You
      remember the advertisements! Good Heavens! what is to be done? I would not
      do anything unhandsome or dishonest. But there never was a marriage. I
      never will believe there was a marriage&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a marriage, Robert Beaufort,&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne, almost
      enjoying the torture he was about to inflict; &ldquo;and I hold here a paper
      that Philip Vaudemont&mdash;for so we will yet call him&mdash;would give
      his right hand to clutch for a moment. I have but just found it in a
      secret cavity in that bureau. Robert, on this paper may depend the fate,
      the fortune, the prosperity, the greatness of Philip Vaudemont;&mdash;or
      his poverty, his exile, his ruin. See!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Robert Beaufort glanced over the paper held out to him&mdash;dropped it on
      the floor&mdash;and staggered to a seat. Lilburne coolly replaced the
      document in the bureau, and, limping to his brother-in-law, said with a
      smile,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the paper is in my possession&mdash;I will not destroy it. No; I have
      no right to destroy it. Besides, it would be a crime; but if I give it to
      you, you can do with it as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lilburne, spare me&mdash;spare me. I meant to be an honest man. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
       And Robert Beaufort sobbed. Lilburne looked at him in scornful surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not fear that I shall ever think worse of you; and who else will know
      it? Do not fear me. No;&mdash;I, too, have reasons to hate and to fear
      this Philip Vaudemont; for Vaudemont shall be his name, and not Beaufort,
      in spite of fifty such scraps of paper! He has known a man&mdash;my worst
      foe&mdash;he has secrets of mine&mdash;of my past&mdash;perhaps of my
      present: but I laugh at his knowledge while he is a wandering adventurer;&mdash;I
      should tremble at that knowledge if he could thunder it out to the world
      as Philip Beaufort of Beaufort Court! There, I am candid with you. Now
      hear my plan. Prove to Arthur that his visitor is a convicted felon, by
      sending the officers of justice after him instantly&mdash;off with him
      again to the Settlements. Defy a single witness&mdash;entrap Vaudemont
      back to France and prove him (I think I will prove him such&mdash;I think
      so&mdash;with a little money and a little pains)&mdash;prove him the
      accomplice of William Gawtrey, a coiner and a murderer! Pshaw! take yon
      paper. Do with it as you will&mdash;keep it&mdash;give it to Arthur&mdash;let
      Philip Vaudemont have it, and Philip Vaudemont will be rich and great, the
      happiest man between earth and paradise! On the other hand, come and tell
      me that you have lost it, or that I never gave you such a paper, or that
      no such paper ever existed; and Philip Vaudemont may live a pauper, and
      die, perhaps, a slave at the galleys! Lose it, I say,&mdash;lose it,&mdash;and
      advise with me upon the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horror-struck, bewildered, the weak man gazed upon the calm face of the
      Master-villain, as the scholar of the old fables might have gazed on the
      fiend who put before him worldly prosperity here and the loss of his soul
      hereafter. He had never hitherto regarded Lilburne in his true light. He
      was appalled by the black heart that lay bare before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t destroy it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he faltered out; &ldquo;and if I did, out of
      love for Arthur,&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk of galleys,&mdash;of vengeance&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The arrears of the rents you have enjoyed will send you to gaol for your
      life. No, no; don&rsquo;t destroy the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaufort rose with a desperate effort; he moved to the bureau. Fanny&rsquo;s
      heart was on her lips;&mdash;of this long conference she had understood
      only the one broad point on which Lilburne had insisted with an emphasis
      that could have enlightened an infant; and he looked on Beaufort as an
      infant then&mdash;On that paper rested Philip Vaudemont&rsquo;s fate&mdash;happiness
      if saved, ruin if destroyed; Philip&mdash;her Philip! And Philip himself
      had said to her once&mdash;when had she ever forgotten his words? and now
      how those words flashed across her&mdash;Philip himself had said to her
      once, &ldquo;Upon a scrap of paper, if I could but find it, may depend my whole
      fortune, my whole happiness, all that I care for in life.&rdquo;&mdash;Robert
      Beaufort moved to the bureau&mdash;he seized the document&mdash;he looked
      over it again, hurriedly, and ere Lilburne, who by no means wished to have
      it destroyed in his own presence, was aware of his intention&mdash;he
      hastened with tottering steps to the hearth-averted his eyes, and cast it
      on the fire. At that instant something white&mdash;he scarce knew what, it
      seemed to him as a spirit, as a ghost&mdash;darted by him, and snatched
      the paper, as yet uninjured, from the embers! There was a pause for the
      hundredth part of a moment:&mdash;a gurgling sound of astonishment and
      horror from Beaufort&mdash;an exclamation from Lilburne&mdash;a laugh from
      Fanny, as, her eyes flashing light, with a proud dilation of stature, with
      the paper clasped tightly to her bosom, she turned her looks of triumph
      from one to the other. The two men were both too amazed, at the instant,
      for rapid measures. But Lilburne, recovering himself first, hastened to
      her; she eluded his grasp&mdash;she made towards the door to the passage;
      when Lilburne, seriously alarmed, seized her arm;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish child!&mdash;give me that paper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never but with my life!&rdquo; And Fanny&rsquo;s cry for help rang through the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; the speech died on his lips, for at that instant a rapid
      stride was heard without&mdash;a momentary scuffle&mdash;voices in
      altercation;&mdash;the door gave way as if a battering ram had forced it;&mdash;not
      so much thrown forward as actually hurled into the room, the body of
      Dykeman fell heavily, like a dead man&rsquo;s, at the very feet of Lord Lilburne&mdash;and
      Philip Vaudemont stood in the doorway!
    </p>
    <p>
      The grasp of Lilburne on Fanny&rsquo;s arm relaxed, and the girl, with one
      bound, sprung to Philip&rsquo;s breast. &ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;take it&mdash;take
      it!&rdquo; and she thrust the paper into his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them have it&mdash;read
      it&mdash;see it&mdash;never mind me!&rdquo; But Philip, though his hand
      unconsciously closed on the precious document, did mind Fanny; and in that
      moment her cause was the only one in the world to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foul villain!&rdquo; he said, as he strode to Lilburne, while Fanny still clung
      to his breast: &ldquo;Speak!&mdash;speak!&mdash;is&mdash;she&mdash;is she?&mdash;man&mdash;man,
      speak!&mdash;you know what I would say!&mdash;She is the child of your own
      daughter&mdash;the grandchild of that Mary whom you dishonoured&mdash;the
      child of the woman whom William Gawtrey saved from pollution! Before he
      died, Gawtrey commended her to my care!&mdash;O God of Heaven!&mdash;speak!&mdash;I
      am not too late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The manner, the words, the face of Philip left Lilburne terror-stricken
      with conviction. But the man&rsquo;s crafty ability, debased as it was,
      triumphed even over remorse for the dread guilt meditated,&mdash;over
      gratitude for the dread guilt spared. He glanced at Beaufort&mdash;at
      Dykeman, who now, slowly recovering, gazed at him with eyes that seemed
      starting from their sockets; and lastly fixed his look on Philip himself.
      There were three witnesses&mdash;presence of mind was his great attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if, Monsieur de Vaudemont, I knew, or, at least, had the firmest
      persuasion that Fanny was my grandchild, what then? Why else should she be
      here?&mdash;Pooh, sir! I am an old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip recoiled a step in wonder; his plain sense was baffled by the calm
      lie. He looked down at Fanny, who, comprehending nothing of what was
      spoken, for all her faculties, even her very sense of sight and hearing,
      were absorbed in her impatient anxiety for him, cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm has come to Fanny&mdash;none: only frightened. Read!&mdash;Read!&mdash;Save
      that paper!&mdash;You know what you once said about a mere scrap of paper!
      Come away! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did now cast his eyes on the paper he held. That was an awful moment
      for Robert Beaufort&mdash;even for Lilburne! To snatch the fatal document
      from that gripe! They would as soon have snatched it from a tiger! He
      lifted his eyes&mdash;they rested on his mother&rsquo;s picture! Her lips smiled
      on him! He turned to Beaufort in a state of emotion too exulting, too
      blest for vulgar vengeance&mdash;for vulgar triumph&mdash;almost for
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look yonder, Robert Beaufort&mdash;look!&rdquo; and he pointed to the picture.
      &ldquo;Her name is spotless! I stand again beneath a roof that was my father&rsquo;s,&mdash;the
      Heir of Beaufort! We shall meet before the justice of our country. For
      you, Lord Lilburne, I will believe you: it is too horrible to doubt even
      your intentions. If wrong had chanced to her, I would have rent you where
      you stand, limb from limb. And thank her&rdquo;,&mdash;(for Lilburne recovered
      at this language the daring of his youth, before calculation, indolence,
      and excess had dulled the edge of his nerves; and, unawed by the height,
      and manhood, and strength of his menacer, stalked haughtily up to him)&mdash;&ldquo;and
      thank your relationship to her,&rdquo; said Philip, sinking his voice into a
      whisper, &ldquo;that I do not brand you as a pilferer and a cheat! Hush, knave!&mdash;hush,
      pupil of George Gawtrey!&mdash;there are no duels for me but with men of
      honour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lilburne now turned white, and the big word stuck in his throat. In
      another instant Fanny and her guardian had quitted the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dykeman,&rdquo; said Lord Lilburne after a long silence, &ldquo;I shall ask you
      another time how you came to admit that impertinent person. At present, go
      and order breakfast for Mr. Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Dykeman, more astounded, perhaps, by his lord&rsquo;s coolness than
      even by the preceding circumstances, had left the study, Lilburne came up
      to Beaufort,&mdash;who seemed absolutely stricken as if by palsy,&mdash;and
      touching him impatiently and rudely, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sdeath, man!&mdash;rouse yourself! There is not a moment to be lost! I
      have already decided on what you are to do. This paper is not worth a
      rush, unless the curate who examined it will depose to that fact. He is a
      curate&mdash;a Welsh curate;&mdash;you are yet Mr. Beaufort, a rich and a
      great man. The curate, properly managed, may depose to the contrary; and
      then we will indict them all for forgery and conspiracy. At the worst, you
      can, no doubt, get the parson to forget all about it&mdash;to stay away.
      His address was on the certificate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;C&mdash;&mdash;-. Go yourself into Wales without an instant&rsquo;s
      delay&mdash; Then, having arranged with Mr. Jones, hurry back, cross to
      Boulogne, and buy this convict and his witnesses, buy them! That, now, is
      the only thing. Quick! quick!&mdash;quick! Zounds, man! if it were my
      affair, my estate, I would not care a pin for that fragment of paper; I
      should rather rejoice at it. I see how it could be turned against them!
      Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I am not equal to it! Will you manage it? will you? Half my
      estate!&mdash;all! Take it: but save&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; interrupted Lord Lilburne, in great disdain. &ldquo;I am as rich as I
      want to be. Money does not bribe me. I manage this! I! Lord Lilburne. I!
      Why, if found out, it is subornation of witnesses. It is exposure&mdash;it
      is dishonour&mdash;it is ruin. What then? You should take the risk&mdash;for
      you must meet ruin if you do not. I cannot. I have nothing to gain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not!&mdash;I dare not!&rdquo; murmured Beaufort, quite spirit-broken.
      &ldquo;Subornation, dishonour, exposure!&mdash;and I, so respectable&mdash;my
      character!&mdash;and my son against me, too!&mdash;my son, in whom I lived
      again! No, no; let them take all! Let them take it! Ha! ha! let them take
      it! Good-day to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall consult Mr. Blackwell, and I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo; And Beaufort
      walked tremulously back to his carriage. &ldquo;Go to his lawyer!&rdquo; growled
      Lilburne. &ldquo;Yes, if his lawyer can help him to defraud men lawfully, he&rsquo;ll
      defraud them fast enough. That will be the respectable way of doing it!
      Um!&mdash;This may be an ugly business for me&mdash;the paper found here&mdash;if
      the girl can depose to what she heard, and she must have heard something.&mdash;No,
      I think the laws of real property will hardly allow her evidence; and if
      they do&mdash;Um!&mdash;My granddaughter&mdash;is it possible!&mdash;And
      Gawtrey rescued her mother, my child, from her own mother&rsquo;s vices! I
      thought my liking to that girl different from any other I have ever felt:
      it was pure&mdash;it was!&mdash;it was pity&mdash;affection. And I must
      never see her again&mdash;must forget the whole thing! And I am growing
      old&mdash;and I am childless&mdash;and alone!&rdquo; He paused, almost with a
      groan: and then the expression of his face changing to rage, he cried out,
      &ldquo;The man threatened me, and I was a coward! What to do?&mdash;Nothing! The
      defensive is my line. I shall play no more.&mdash;I attack no one. Who
      will accuse Lord Lilburne? Still, Robert is a fool. I must not leave him
      to himself. Ho! there! Dykeman!&mdash;the carriage! I shall go to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunate, no doubt, it was for Philip that Mr. Beaufort was not Lord
      Lilburne. For all history teaches us&mdash;public and private history&mdash;conquerors&mdash;statesmen&mdash;sharp
      hypocrites and brave designers&mdash;yes, they all teach us how mighty one
      man of great intellect and no scruple is against the justice of millions!
      The One Man moves&mdash;the Mass is inert. Justice sits on a throne.
      Roguery never rests,&mdash;Activity is the lever of Archimedes.

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Quam inulta injusta ac prava fiunt moribus.&rdquo;&mdash;TULL.

     [How many unjust and vicious actions are perpetrated
     under the name of morals.]

             &ldquo;Volat ambiguis
             Mobilis alis Hera.&rdquo;&mdash;SENECA.

         [The hour flies moving with doubtful wings.]
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Beaufort sought Mr. Blackwell, and long, rambling, and
      disjointed was his narrative. Mr. Blackwell, after some consideration,
      proposed to set about doing the very things that Lilburne had proposed at
      once to do. But the lawyer expressed himself legally and covertly, so that
      it did not seem to the sober sense of Mr. Beaufort at all the same plan.
      He was not the least alarmed at what Mr. Blackwell proposed, though so
      shocked at what Lilburne dictated. Blackwell would go the next day into
      Wales&mdash;he would find out Mr. Jones&mdash;he would sound him! Nothing
      was more common with people of the nicest honour, than just to get a
      witness out of the way! Done in election petitions, for instance, every
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Beaufort, much relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after having done that, Mr. Blackwell would return to town, and
      cross over to Boulogne to see this very impudent person whom Arthur (young
      men were so apt to be taken in!) had actually believed. He had no doubt he
      could settle it all. Robert Beaufort returned to Berkeley Square actually
      in spirits. There he found Lilburne, who, on reflection, seeing that
      Blackwell was at all events more up to the business than his brother,
      assented to the propriety of the arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blackwell accordingly did set off the next day. That next day,
      perhaps, made all the difference. Within two hours from his gaining the
      document so important, Philip, without any subtler exertion of intellect
      than the decision of a plain, bold sense, had already forestalled both the
      peer and the lawyer. He had sent down Mr. Barlow&rsquo;s head clerk to his
      master in Wales with the document, and a short account of the manner in
      which it had been discovered. And fortunate, indeed, was it that the copy
      had been found; for all the inquiries of Mr. Barlow at A&mdash;&mdash; had
      failed, and probably would have failed, without such a clue, in fastening
      upon any one probable person to have officiated as Caleb Price&rsquo;s
      amanuensis. The sixteen hours&rsquo; start Mr. Barlow gained over Blackwell
      enabled the former to see Mr. Jones&mdash;to show him his own handwriting&mdash;to
      get a written and witnessed attestation from which the curate, however
      poor, and however tempted, could never well have escaped (even had he been
      dishonest, which he was not), of his perfect recollection of the fact of
      making an extract from the registry at Caleb&rsquo;s desire, though he owned he
      had quite forgotten the names he extracted till they were again placed
      before him. Barlow took care to arouse Mr. Jones&rsquo;s interest in the case&mdash;quitted
      Wales&mdash;hastened over to Boulogne&mdash;saw Captain Smith, and without
      bribes, without threats, but by plainly proving to that worthy person that
      he could not return to England nor see his brother without being
      immediately arrested; that his brother&rsquo;s evidence was already pledged on
      the side of truth; and that by the acquisition of new testimony there
      could be no doubt that the suit would be successful&mdash;he diverted the
      captain from all disposition towards perfidy, convinced him on which side
      his interest lay, and saw him return to Paris, where very shortly
      afterwards he disappeared for ever from this world, being forced into a
      duel, much against his will (with a Frenchman whom he had attempted to
      defraud), and shot through the lungs. Thus verifying a favourite maxim of
      Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s, viz. that it does not do, in the long run, for little men
      to play the Great Game!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same day that Blackwell returned, frustrated in his half-and-half
      attempts to corrupt Mr. Jones, and not having been able even to discover
      Mr. Smith, Mr. Robert Beaufort received a notice of an Action for
      Ejectment to be brought by Philip Beaufort at the next Assizes. And, to
      add to his afflictions, Arthur, whom he had hitherto endeavoured to amuse
      by a sort of ambiguous shilly-shally correspondence, became so alarmingly
      worse, that his mother brought him up to town for advice. Lord Lilburne
      was, of course, sent for; and on learning all, his counsel was prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you before that this man loves your daughter. See if you can
      effect a compromise. The lawsuit will be ugly, and probably ruinous. He
      has a right to claim six years&rsquo; arrears&mdash;that is above L100,000. Make
      yourself his father-in-law, and me his uncle-in-law; and, since we can&rsquo;t
      kill the wasp, we may at least soften the venom of his sting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beaufort, still perplexed, irresolute, sought his son; and, for the first
      time, spoke to him frankly&mdash;that is, frankly for Robert Beaufort! He
      owned that the copy of the register had been found by Lilburne in a secret
      drawer. He made the best of the story Lilburne himself furnished him with
      (adhering, of course, to the assertion uttered or insinuated to Philip) in
      regard to Fanny&rsquo;s abduction and interposition; he said nothing of his
      attempt to destroy the paper. Why should he? By admitting the copy in
      court&mdash;if so advised&mdash;he could get rid of Fanny&rsquo;s evidence
      altogether; even without such concession, her evidence might possibly be
      objected to or eluded. He confessed that he feared the witness who copied
      the register and the witness to the marriage were alive. And then he
      talked pathetically of his desire to do what was right, his dread of
      slander and misinterpretation. He said nothing of Sidney, and his belief
      that Sidney and Charles Spencer were the same; because, if his daughter
      were to be the instrument for effecting a compromise, it was clear that
      her engagement with Spencer must be cancelled and concealed. And luckily
      Arthur&rsquo;s illness and Camilla&rsquo;s timidity, joined now to her father&rsquo;s
      injunctions not to excite Arthur in his present state with any additional
      causes of anxiety, prevented the confidence that might otherwise have
      ensued between the brother and sister. And Camilla, indeed, had no heart
      for such a conference. How, when she looked on Arthur&rsquo;s glassy eye, and
      listened to his hectic cough, could she talk to him of love and marriage?
      As to the automaton, Mrs. Beaufort, Robert made sure of her discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur listened attentively to his father&rsquo;s communication; and the result
      of that interview was the following letter from Arthur to his cousin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I write to you without fear of misconstruction; for I write to you
      unknown to all my family, and I am the only one of them who can have no
      personal interest in the struggle about to take place between my father
      and yourself. Before the law can decide between you, I shall be in my
      grave. I write this from the Bed of Death. Philip, I write this&mdash;I,
      who stood beside a deathbed more sacred to you than mine&mdash;I, who
      received your mother&rsquo;s last sigh. And with that sigh there was a smile
      that lasted when the sigh was gone: for I promised to befriend her
      children. Heaven knows how anxiously I sought to fulfil that solemn vow!
      Feeble and sick myself, I followed you and your brother with no aim, no
      prayer, but this,&mdash;to embrace you and say, &lsquo;Accept a new brother in
      me.&rsquo; I spare you the humiliation, for it is yours, not mine, of recalling
      what passed between us when at last we met. Yet, I still sought to save,
      at least, Sidney,&mdash;more especially confided to my care by his dying
      mother. He mysteriously eluded our search; but we had reason, by a letter
      received from some unknown hand, to believe him saved and provided for.
      Again I met you at Paris. I saw you were poor. Judging from your
      associate, I might with justice think you depraved. Mindful of your
      declaration never to accept bounty from a Beaufort, and remembering with
      natural resentment the outrage I had before received from you, I judged it
      vain to seek and remonstrate with you, but I did not judge it vain to aid.
      I sent you, anonymously, what at least would suffice, if absolute poverty
      had subjected you to evil courses, to rescue you from them it your heart
      were so disposed. Perhaps that sum, trifling as it was, may have smoothed
      your path and assisted your career. And why tell you all this now? To
      dissuade from asserting rights you conceive to be just?&mdash;Heaven
      forbid! If justice is with you, so also is the duty due to your mother&rsquo;s
      name. But simply for this: that in asserting such rights, you content
      yourself with justice, not revenge&mdash;that in righting yourself, you do
      not wrong others. If the law should decide for you, the arrears you could
      demand would leave my father and sister beggars. This may be law&mdash;it
      would not be justice; for my father solemnly believed himself, and had
      every apparent probability in his favour, the true heir of the wealth that
      devolved upon him. This is not all. There may be circumstances connected
      with the discovery of a certain document that, if authentic, and I do not
      presume to question it, may decide the contest so far as it rests on
      truth; circumstances which might seem to bear hard upon my father&rsquo;s good
      name and faith. I do not know sufficiently of law to say how far these
      could be publicly urged, or, if urged, exaggerated and tortured by an
      advocate&rsquo;s calumnious ingenuity. But again, I say justice, and not
      revenge! And with this I conclude, inclosing to you these lines, written
      in your own hand, and leaving you the arbiter of their value.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
             &ldquo;ARTHUR BEAUFORT.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The lines inclosed were these, a second time placed before the reader
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;I cannot guess who you are. They say that you call yourself a
   relation; that must be some mistake. I knew not that my poor mother
   had relations so kind. But, whoever you be, you soothed her last
   hours&mdash;she died in your arms; and if ever-years, long years, hence&mdash;
   we should chance to meet, and I can do anything to aid another, my
   blood, and my life, and my heart, and my soul, all are slaves to
   your will! If you be really of her kindred I commend to you my
   brother; he is at &mdash;&mdash; with Mr. Morton. If you can serve him, my
   mother&rsquo;s soul will watch over you as a guardian angel. As for me, I
   ask no help from any one; I go into the world, and will carve out my
   own way. So much do I shrink from the thought of charity from
   others, that I do not believe I could bless you as I do now, if your
   kindness to me did not close with the stone upon my mother&rsquo;s grave.

                       PHILIP.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This letter was sent to the only address of Monsieur de Vaudemont which
      the Beauforts knew, viz., his apartments in town, and he did not receive
      it the day it was sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Arthur Beaufort&rsquo;s malady continued to gain ground rapidly. His
      father, absorbed in his own more selfish fears (though, at the first sight
      of Arthur, overcome by the alteration of his appearance), had ceased to
      consider his illness fatal. In fact, his affection for Arthur was rather
      one of pride than love: long absence had weakened the ties of early
      custom. He prized him as an heir rather than treasured him as a son. It
      almost seemed that as the Heritage was in danger, so the Heir became less
      dear: this was only because he was less thought of. Poor Mrs. Beaufort,
      yet but partially acquainted with the terrors of her husband, still clung
      to hope for Arthur. Her affection for him brought out from the depths of
      her cold and insignificant character qualities that had never before been
      apparent. She watched&mdash;she nursed&mdash;she tended him. The fine lady
      was gone; nothing but the mother was left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a delicate constitution, and with an easy temper, which yielded to
      the influence of companions inferior to himself, except in bodily vigour
      and more sturdy will, Arthur Beaufort had been ruined by prosperity. His
      talents and acquirements, if not first-rate, at least far above
      mediocrity, had only served to refine his tastes, not to strengthen his
      mind. His amiable impulses, his charming disposition and sweet temper, had
      only served to make him the dupe of the parasites that feasted on the
      lavish heir. His heart, frittered away in the usual round of light
      intrigues and hollow pleasures, had become too sated and exhausted for the
      redeeming blessings of a deep and a noble love. He had so lived for
      Pleasure that he had never known Happiness. His frame broke by excesses in
      which his better nature never took delight, he came home&mdash;to hear of
      ruin and to die!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening in the sick-room. Arthur had risen from the bed to which,
      for some days, he had voluntarily taken, and was stretched on the sofa
      before the fire. Camilla was leaning over him, keeping in the shade, that
      he might not see the tears which she could not suppress. His mother had
      been endeavouring to amuse him, as she would have amused herself, by
      reading aloud one of the light novels of the hour; novels that paint the
      life of the higher classes as one gorgeous holyday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; said the patient querulously, &ldquo;I have no interest in
      these false descriptions of the life I have led. I know that life&rsquo;s worth.
      Ah! had I been trained to some employment, some profession! had I&mdash;well&mdash;it
      is weak to repine. Mother, tell me, you have seen Mons. de Vaudemont: is
      he strong and healthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; too much so. He has not your elegance, dear Arthur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you admire him, Camilla? Has no other caught your heart or your
      fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Arthur,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Beaufort, &ldquo;you forget that Camilla is
      scarcely out; and of course a young girl&rsquo;s affections, if she&rsquo;s well
      brought up, are regulated by the experience of her parents. It is time to
      take the medicine: it certainly agrees with you; you have more colour
      to-day, my dear, dear son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Mrs. Beaufort was pouring out the medicine, the door gently opened,
      and Mr. Robert Beaufort appeared; behind him there rose a taller and a
      statelier form, but one which seemed more bent, more humbled, more
      agitated. Beaufort advanced. Camilla looked up and turned pale. The
      visitor escaped from Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s grasp on his arm; he came forward,
      trembling, he fell on his knees beside Arthur, and seizing his hand, bent
      over, it in silence. But silence so stormy! silence more impressive than
      all words his breast heaved, his whole frame shook. Arthur guessed at once
      whom he saw, and bent down gently as if to raise his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Arthur! Arthur!&rdquo; then cried Philip; &ldquo;forgive me! My mother&rsquo;s
      comforter&mdash;my cousin&mdash;my brother! Oh! brother, forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he half rose, Arthur stretched out his arms, and Philip clasped him
      to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in vain to describe the different feelings that agitated those who
      beheld; the selfish congratulations of Robert, mingled with a better and
      purer feeling; the stupor of the mother; the emotions that she herself
      could not unravel, which rooted Camilla to the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You own me, then,&mdash;you own me!&rdquo; cried Philip. &ldquo;You accept the
      brotherhood that my mad passions once rejected! And you, too&mdash;you,
      Camilla&mdash;you who once knelt by my side, under this very roof&mdash;do
      you remember me now? Oh, Arthur! that letter&mdash;that letter!&mdash;yes,
      indeed, that aid which I ascribed to any one&mdash;rather than to you&mdash;made
      the date of a fairer fortune. I may have owed to that aid the very fate
      that has preserved me till now; the very name which I have not
      discredited. No, no; do not think you can ask me a favour; you can but
      claim your due. Brother! my dear brother!&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Warwick.&mdash;Exceeding well! his cares are now all over.&rdquo;
    &mdash;Henry IV.
</pre>
    <p>
      The excitement of this interview soon overpowering Arthur, Philip, in
      quitting the room with Mr. Beaufort, asked a conference with that
      gentleman; and they went into the very parlour from which the rich man had
      once threatened to expel the haggard suppliant. Philip glanced round the
      room, and the whole scene came again before him. After a pause, he thus
      began,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beaufort, let the Past be forgotten. We may have need of mutual
      forgiveness, and I, who have so wronged your noble son, am willing to
      suppose that I misjudged you. I cannot, it is true, forego this lawsuit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to do so. I am the trustee of my father&rsquo;s honour and my
      mother&rsquo;s name: I must vindicate both: I cannot forego this lawsuit. But
      when I once bowed myself to enter your house&mdash;then only with a hope,
      where now I have the certainty of obtaining my heritage&mdash;it was with
      the resolve to bury in oblivion every sentiment that would transgress the
      most temperate justice. Now, I will do more. If the law decide against me,
      we are as we were; if with me&mdash;listen: I will leave you the lands of
      Beaufort, for your life and your son&rsquo;s. I ask but for me and for mine such
      a deduction from your wealth as will enable me, should my brother be yet
      living, to provide for him; and (if you approve the choice, which out of
      all earth I would desire to make) to give whatever belongs to more refined
      or graceful existence than I myself care for,&mdash;to her whom I would
      call my wife. Robert Beaufort, in this room I once asked you to restore to
      me the only being I then loved: I am now again your suppliant; and this
      time you have it in your power to grant my prayer. Let Arthur be, in
      truth, my brother: give me, if I prove myself, as I feel assured, entitled
      to hold the name my father bore, give me your daughter as my wife; give me
      Camilla, and I will not envy you the lands I am willing for myself to
      resign; and if they pass to any children, those children will be your
      daughter&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first impulse of Mr. Beaufort was to grasp the hand held out to him;
      to pour forth an incoherent torrent of praise and protestation, of
      assurances that he could not hear of such generosity, that what was right
      was right, that he should be proud of such a son-in-law, and much more in
      the same key. And in the midst of this, it suddenly occurred to Mr.
      Beaufort, that if Philip&rsquo;s case were really as good as he said it was, he
      could not talk so coolly of resigning the property it would secure him for
      the term of a life (Mr. Beaufort thought of his own) so uncommonly good,
      to say nothing of Arthur&rsquo;s. At this notion, he thought it best not to
      commit himself too far; drew in as artfully as he could, until he could
      consult Lord Lilburne and his lawyer; and recollecting also that he had a
      great deal to manage with respect to Camilla and her prior attachment, he
      began to talk of his distress for Arthur, of the necessity of waiting a
      little before Camilla was spoken to, while so agitated about her brother,
      of the exceedingly strong case which his lawyer advised him he possessed&mdash;not
      but what he would rather rest the matter on justice than law&mdash;and
      that if the law should be with him, he would not the less (provided he did
      not force his daughter&rsquo;s inclinations, of which, indeed, he had no fear)
      be most happy to bestow her hand on his brother&rsquo;s nephew, with such a
      portion as would be most handsome to all parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      It often happens to us in this world, that when we come with our heart in
      our hands to some person or other,&mdash;when we pour out some generous
      burst of feeling so enthusiastic and self-sacrificing, that a bystander
      would call us fool and Quixote;&mdash;it often, I say, happens to us, to
      find our warm self suddenly thrown back upon our cold self; to discover
      that we are utterly uncomprehended, and that the swine who would have
      munched up the acorn does not know what to make of the pearl. That sudden
      ice which then freezes over us, that supreme disgust and despair almost of
      the whole world, which for the moment we confound with the one worldling&mdash;they
      who have felt, may reasonably ascribe to Philip. He listened to Mr.
      Beaufort in utter and contemptuous silence, and then replied only,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, at all events this is a question for law to decide. If it decide as
      you think, it is for you to act; if as I think, it is for me. Till then I
      will speak to you no more of your daughter, or my intentions. Meanwhile,
      all I ask is the liberty to visit your son. I would not be banished from
      his sick-room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear nephew!&rdquo; cried Mr. Beaufort, again alarmed, &ldquo;consider this house
      as your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip bowed and retreated to the door, followed obsequiously by his
      uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that both Lord Lilburne and Mr. Blackwell were of the same mind
      as to the course advisable for Mr. Beaufort now to pursue. Lord Lilburne
      was not only anxious to exchange a hostile litigation for an amicable
      lawsuit, but he was really eager to put the seal of relationship upon any
      secret with regard to himself that a man who might inherit L20,000. a year&mdash;a
      dead shot, and a bold tongue&mdash;might think fit to disclose. This made
      him more earnest than he otherwise might have been in advice as to other
      people&rsquo;s affairs. He spoke to Beaufort as a man of the world&mdash;to
      Blackwell as a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pin the man down to his generosity,&rdquo; said Lilburne, &ldquo;before he gets the
      property. Possession makes a great change in a man&rsquo;s value of money. After
      all, you can&rsquo;t enjoy the property when you&rsquo;re dead: he gives it next to
      Arthur, who is not married; and if anything happen to Arthur, poor fellow,
      why, in devolving on your daughter&rsquo;s husband and children, it goes in the
      right line. Pin him down at once: get credit with the world for the most
      noble and disinterested conduct, by letting your counsel state that the
      instant you discovered the lost document you wished to throw no obstacle
      in the way of proving the marriage, and that the only thing to consider
      is, if the marriage be proved; if so, you will be the first to rejoice,
      &amp;c. &amp;c. You know all that sort of humbug as well as any man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blackwell suggested the same advice, though in different words&mdash;after
      taking the opinions of three eminent members of the bar; those opinions,
      indeed, were not all alike&mdash;one was adverse to Mr. Robert Beaufort&rsquo;s
      chance of success, one was doubtful of it, the third maintained that he
      had nothing to fear from the action&mdash;except, possibly, the
      ill-natured construction of the world. Mr. Robert Beaufort disliked the
      idea of the world&rsquo;s ill-nature, almost as much as he did that of losing
      his property. And when even this last and more encouraging authority,
      learning privately from Mr. Blackwell that Arthur&rsquo;s illness was of a
      nature to terminate fatally, observed, &ldquo;that a compromise with a claimant,
      who was at all events Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s nephew, by which Mr. Beaufort could
      secure the enjoyment of the estates to himself for life, and to his son
      for life also, should not (whatever his probabilities of legal success) be
      hastily rejected&mdash;unless he had a peculiar affection for a very
      distant relation&mdash;who, failing Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s male issue and Philip&rsquo;s
      claim, would be heir-at-law, but whose rights would cease if Arthur liked
      to cut off the entail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort at once decided. He had a personal dislike to that distant
      heir-at-law; he had a strong desire to retain the esteem of the world; he
      had an innate conviction of the justice of Philip&rsquo;s claim; he had a
      remorseful recollection of his brother&rsquo;s generous kindness to himself; he
      preferred to have for his heir, in case of Arthur&rsquo;s decease, a nephew who
      would marry his daughter, than a remote kinsman. And should, after all,
      the lawsuit fail to prove Philip&rsquo;s right, he was not sorry to have the
      estate in his own power by Arthur&rsquo;s act in cutting off the entail. Brief;
      all these reasons decided him. He saw Philip&mdash;he spoke to Arthur&mdash;and
      all the preliminaries, as suggested above, were arranged between the
      parties. The entail was cut off, and Arthur secretly prevailed upon his
      father, to whom, for the present, the fee-simple thus belonged, to make a
      will, by which he bequeathed the estates to Philip, without reference to
      the question of his legitimacy. Mr. Beaufort felt his conscience greatly
      eased after this action&mdash;which, too, he could always retract if he
      pleased; and henceforth the lawsuit became but a matter of form, so far as
      the property it involved was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these negotiations went on, Arthur continued gradually to decline.
      Philip was with him always. The sufferer took a strange liking to this
      long-dreaded relation, this man of iron frame and thews. In Philip there
      was so much of life, that Arthur almost felt as if in his presence itself
      there was an antagonism to death. And Camilla saw thus her cousin, day by
      day, hour by hour, in that sick chamber, lending himself, with the gentle
      tenderness of a woman, to soften the pang, to arouse the weariness, to
      cheer the dejection. Philip never spoke to her of love: in such a scene
      that had been impossible. She overcame in their mutual cares the
      embarrassment she had before felt in his presence; whatever her other
      feelings, she could not, at least, but be grateful to one so tender to her
      brother. Three letters of Charles Spencer&rsquo;s had been, in the afflictions
      of the house, only answered by a brief line. She now took the occasion of
      a momentary and delusive amelioration in Arthur&rsquo;s disease to write to him
      more at length. She was carrying, as usual, the letter to her mother, when
      Mr. Beaufort met her, and took the letter from her hand. He looked
      embarrassed for a moment, and bade her follow him into his study. It was
      then that Camilla learned, for the first time, distinctly, the claims and
      rights of her cousin; then she learned also at what price those rights
      were to be enforced with the least possible injury to her father. Mr.
      Beaufort naturally put the case before her in the strongest point of the
      dilemma. He was to be ruined&mdash;utterly ruined; a pauper, a beggar, if
      Camilla did not save him. The master of his fate demanded his daughter&rsquo;s
      hand. Habitually subservient to even a whim of her parents, this
      intelligence, the entreaty, the command with which it was accompanied,
      overwhelmed her. She answered but by tears; and Mr. Beaufort, assured of
      her submission, left her, to consider of the tone of the letter he himself
      should write to Mr. Spencer. He had sat down to this very task when he was
      summoned to Arthur&rsquo;s room. His son was suddenly taken worse: spasms that
      threatened immediate danger convulsed and exhausted him, and when these
      were allayed, he continued for three days so feeble that Mr. Beaufort, his
      eyes now thoroughly opened to the loss that awaited him, had no thoughts
      even for worldly interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the third day, Philip, Robert Beaufort, his wife, his
      daughter, were grouped round the death-bed of Arthur. The sufferer had
      just wakened from sleep, and he motioned to Philip to raise him. Mr.
      Beaufort started, as by the dim light he saw his son in the arms of
      Catherine&rsquo;s! and another Chamber of Death seemed, shadow-like, to replace
      the one before him. Words, long since uttered, knelled in his ear: &ldquo;There
      shall be a death-bed yet beside which you shall see the spectre of her,
      now so calm, rising for retribution from the grave!&rdquo; His blood froze, his
      hair stood erect; he cast a hurried, shrinking glance round the twilight
      of the darkened room: and with a feeble cry covered his white face with
      his trembling hands! But on Arthur&rsquo;s lips there was a serene smile; he
      turned his eyes from Philip to Camilla, and murmured, &ldquo;She will repay
      you!&rdquo; A pause, and the mother&rsquo;s shriek rang through the room! Robert
      Beaufort raised his face from his hands. His son was dead!

        &ldquo;Jul. And what reward do you propose?

        It must be my love.&rdquo;&mdash;The Double Marriage.
</pre>
    <p>
      While these events, dark, hurried, and stormy, had befallen the family of
      his betrothed, Sidney Beaufort continued his calm life by the banks of the
      lovely lake. After a few weeks, his confidence in Camilla&rsquo;s fidelity
      overbore all his apprehensions and forebodings. Her letters, though
      constrained by the inspection to which they were submitted, gave him
      inexpressible consolation and delight. He began, however, early to fancy
      that there was a change in their tone. The letters seemed to shun the one
      subject to which all others were as nought; they turned rather upon the
      guests assembled at Beaufort Court; and why I know not,&mdash;for there
      was nothing in them to authorise jealousy&mdash;the brief words devoted to
      Monsieur de Vaudemont filled him with uneasy and terrible suspicion. He
      gave vent to these feelings, as fully as he dared do, under the knowledge
      that his letter would be seen; and Camilla never again even mentioned the
      name of Vaudemont. Then there was a long pause; then her brother&rsquo;s arrival
      and illness were announced; then, at intervals, but a few hurried lines;
      then a complete, long, dreadful silence, and lastly, with a deep black
      border and a solemn black seal, came the following letter from Mr.
      Beaufort:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have the unutterable grief to announce to you and
      your worthy uncle the irreparable loss I have sustained in the death of my
      only son. It is a month to day since he departed this life. He died, sir,
      as a Christian should die&mdash;humbly, penitently&mdash;exaggerating the
      few faults of his short life, but&mdash;(and here the writer&rsquo;s hypocrisy,
      though so natural to him&mdash;was it, that he knew not that he was
      hypocritical?&mdash;fairly gave way before the real and human anguish, for
      which there is no dictionary!) but I cannot pursue this theme!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slowly now awakening to the duties yet left me to discharge, I cannot but
      be sensible of the material difference in the prospects of my remaining
      child. Miss Beaufort is now the heiress to an ancient name and a large
      fortune. She subscribes with me to the necessity of consulting those new
      considerations which so melancholy an event forces upon her mind. The
      little fancy&mdash;or liking&mdash;(the acquaintance was too short for
      more) that might naturally spring up between two amiable young persons
      thrown together in the country, must be banished from our thoughts. As a
      friend, I shall be always happy to hear of your welfare; and should you
      ever think of a profession in which I can serve you, you may command my
      utmost interest and exertions. I know, my young friend, what you will feel
      at first, and how disposed you will be to call me mercenary and selfish.
      Heaven knows if that be really my character! But at your age, impressions
      are easily effaced; and any experienced friend of the world will assure
      you that, in the altered circumstances of the case, I have no option. All
      intercourse and correspondence, of course, cease with this letter,&mdash;until,
      at least, we may all meet, with no sentiments but those of friendship and
      esteem. I desire my compliments to your worthy uncle, in which Mrs. and
      Miss Beaufort join; and I am sure you will be happy to hear that my wife
      and daughter, though still in great affliction, have suffered less in
      health than I could have ventured to anticipate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ROBERT BEAUFORT.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To C. SPENCER, Esq., Jun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Sidney received this letter, he was with Mr. Spencer, and the latter
      read it over the young man&rsquo;s shoulder, on which he leant affectionately.
      When they came to the concluding words, Sidney turned round with a vacant
      look and a hollow smile. &ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you see&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy&mdash;my son&mdash;you bear this as you ought. Contempt will soon
      efface&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidney started to his feet, and his whole countenance was changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contempt&mdash;yes, for him! But for her&mdash;she knows it not&mdash;she
      is no party to this&mdash;I cannot believe it&mdash;I will not! I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and he rushed out of the room. He was absent till nightfall, and when he
      returned, he endeavoured to appear calm&mdash;but it was in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day brought him a letter from Camilla, written unknown to her
      parents,&mdash;short, it is true (confirming the sentence of separation
      contained in her father&rsquo;s), and imploring him not to reply to it,&mdash;but
      still so full of gentle and of sorrowful feeling, so evidently worded in
      the wish to soften the anguish she inflicted, that it did more than soothe&mdash;it
      even administered hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when Mr. Robert Beaufort had recovered the ordinary tone of his mind
      sufficiently to indite the letter Sidney had just read, he had become
      fully sensible of the necessity of concluding the marriage between Philip
      and Camilla before the publicity of the lawsuit. The action for the
      ejectment could not take place before the ensuing March or April. He would
      waive the ordinary etiquette of time and mourning to arrange all before.
      Indeed, he lived in hourly fear lest Philip should discover that he had a
      rival in his brother, and break off the marriage, with its contingent
      advantages. The first announcement of such a suit in the newspapers might
      reach the Spencers; and if the young man were, as he doubted not, Sidney
      Beaufort, would necessarily bring him forward, and ensure the dreaded
      explanation. Thus apprehensive and ever scheming, Robert Beaufort spoke to
      Philip so much, and with such apparent feeling, of his wish to gratify, at
      the earliest possible period, the last wish of his son, in the union now
      arranged&mdash;he spoke, with such seeming consideration and good sense,
      of the avoidance of all scandal and misinterpretation in the suit itself,
      which suit a previous marriage between the claimant and his daughter would
      show at once to be of so amicable a nature,&mdash;that Philip, ardently in
      love as he was, could not but assent to any hastening of his expected
      happiness compatible with decorum. As to any previous publicity by way of
      newspaper comment, he agreed with Mr. Beaufort in deprecating it. But then
      came the question, What name was he to bear in the interval?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; said Philip, somewhat proudly, &ldquo;when, after my mother&rsquo;s suit
      in her own behalf, I persuaded her not to bear the name of Beaufort,
      though her due&mdash;and for my own part, I prized her own modest name,
      which under such dark appearances was in reality spotless&mdash;as much as
      the loftier one which you bear and my father bore;&mdash;so I shall not
      resume the name the law denies me till the law restores it to me. Law
      alone can efface the wrong which law has done me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beaufort was pleased with this reasoning (erroneous though it was),
      and he now hoped that all would be safely arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a girl so situated as Camilla, and of a character not energetic or
      profound, but submissive, dutiful, and timid, should yield to the
      arguments of her father, the desire of her dying brother&mdash;that she
      should not dare to refuse to become the instrument of peace to a divided
      family, the saving sacrifice to her father&rsquo;s endangered fortunes&mdash;that,
      in fine, when, nearly a month after Arthur&rsquo;s death, her father, leading
      her into the room, where Philip waited her footstep with a beating heart,
      placed her hand in his&mdash;and Philip falling on his knees said, &ldquo;May I
      hope to retain this hand for life?&rdquo;&mdash;she should falter out such words
      as he might construe into not reluctant acquiescence; that all this should
      happen is so natural that the reader is already prepared for it. But still
      she thought with bitter and remorseful feelings of him thus deliberately
      and faithlessly renounced. She felt how deeply he had loved her&mdash;she
      knew how fearful would be his grief. She looked sad and thoughtful; but
      her brother&rsquo;s death was sufficient in Philip&rsquo;s eyes to account for that.
      The praises and gratitude of her father, to whom she suddenly seemed to
      become an object of even greater pride and affection than ever Arthur had
      been&mdash;the comfort of a generous heart, that takes pleasure in the
      very sacrifice it makes&mdash;the acquittal of her conscience as to the
      motives of her conduct&mdash;began, however, to produce their effect. Nor,
      as she had lately seen more of Philip, could she be insensible of his
      attachment&mdash;of his many noble qualities&mdash;of the pride which most
      women might have felt in his addresses, when his rank was once made clear;
      and as she had ever been of a character more regulated by duty than
      passion, so one who could have seen what was passing in her mind would
      have had little fear for Philip&rsquo;s future happiness in her keeping&mdash;little
      fear but that, when once married to him, her affections would have gone
      along with her duties; and that if the first love were yet recalled, it
      would be with a sigh due rather to some romantic recollection than some
      continued regret. Few of either sex are ever united to their first love;
      yet married people jog on, and call each other &ldquo;my dear&rdquo; and &ldquo;my darling&rdquo;
       all the same. It might be, it is true, that Philip would be scarcely loved
      with the intenseness with which he loved; but if Camilla&rsquo;s feelings were
      capable of corresponding to the ardent and impassioned ones of that strong
      and vehement nature&mdash;such feelings were not yet developed in her. The
      heart of the woman might still be half concealed in the vale of the virgin
      innocence. Philip himself was satisfied&mdash;he believed that he was
      beloved: for it is the property of love, in a large and noble heart, to
      reflect itself, and to see its own image in the eyes on which it looks. As
      the Poet gives ideal beauty and excellence to some ordinary child of Eve,
      worshipping less the being that is than the being he imagines and
      conceives&mdash;so Love, which makes us all poets for a while, throws its
      own divine light over a heart perhaps really cold; and becomes dazzled
      into the joy of a false belief by the very lustre with which it surrounds
      its object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more, however, Camilla saw of Philip, the more (gradually overcoming
      her former mysterious and superstitious awe of him) she grew familiarised
      to his peculiar cast of character and thought, so the more she began to
      distrust her father&rsquo;s assertion, that he had insisted on her hand as a
      price&mdash;a bargain&mdash;an equivalent for the sacrifice of a dire
      revenge. And with this thought came another. Was she worthy of this man?&mdash;was
      she not deceiving him? Ought she not to say, at least, that she had known
      a previous attachment, however determined she might be to subdue it? Often
      the desire for this just and honourable confession trembled on her lips,
      and as often was it checked by some chance circumstance or some maiden
      fear. Despite their connection, there was not yet between them that
      delicious intimacy which ought to accompany the affiance of two hearts and
      souls. The gloom of the house; the restraint on the very language of love
      imposed by a death so recent and so deplored, accounted in much for this
      reserve. And for the rest, Robert Beaufort prudently left them very few
      and very brief opportunities to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Philip (now persuaded that the Beauforts were ignorant of
      his brother&rsquo;s fate) had set Mr. Barlow&rsquo;s activity in search of Sidney; and
      his painful anxiety to discover one so dear and so mysteriously lost was
      the only cause of uneasiness apparent in the brightening Future. While
      these researches, hitherto fruitless, were being made, it so happened, as
      London began now to refill, and gossip began now to revive, that a report
      got abroad, no one knew how (probably from the servants) that Monsieur de
      Vaudemont, a distinguished French officer, was shortly to lead the
      daughter and sole heiress of Robert Beaufort, Esq., M.P., to the hymeneal
      altar; and that report very quickly found its way into the London papers:
      from the London papers it spread to the provincial&mdash;it reached the
      eyes of Sidney in his now gloomy and despairing solitude. The day that he
      read it he disappeared.

    <p>
      We have been too long absent from Fanny; it is time to return to her. The
      delight she experienced when Philip made her understand all the benefits,
      the blessings, that her courage, nay, her intellect, had bestowed upon
      him, the blushing ecstasy with which she heard (as they returned to H&mdash;&mdash;,
      the eventful morning of her deliverance, side by side, her hand clasped in
      his, and often pressed to his grateful lips) his praises, his thanks, his
      fear for her safety, his joy at regaining her&mdash;all this amounted to a
      bliss, which, till then, she could not have conceived that life was
      capable of bestowing. And when he left her at H&mdash;&mdash;, to hurry to
      his lawyer&rsquo;s with the recovered document, it was but for an hour. He
      returned, and did not quit her for several days. And in that time he
      became sensible of her astonishing, and, to him, it seemed miraculous,
      improvement in all that renders Mind the equal to Mind; miraculous, for he
      guessed not the Influence that makes miracles its commonplace. And now he
      listened attentively to her when she conversed; he read with her (though
      reading was never much in his vocation), his unfastidious ear was charmed
      with her voice, when it sang those simple songs; and his manner (impressed
      alike by gratitude for the signal service rendered to him, and by the
      discovery that Fanny was no longer a child, whether in mind or years),
      though not less gentle than before, was less familiar, less superior, more
      respectful, and more earnest. It was a change which raised her in her own
      self-esteem. Ah, those were rosy days for Fanny!
    </p>
    <p>
      A less sagacious judge of character than Lilburne would have formed doubts
      perhaps of the nature of Philip&rsquo;s interest in Fanny. But he comprehended
      at once the fraternal interest which a man like Philip might well take in
      a creature like Fanny, if commended to his care by a protector whose doom
      was so awful as that which had ingulfed the life of William Gawtrey.
      Lilburne had some thoughts at first of claiming her, but as he had no
      power to compel her residence with him, he did not wish, on consideration,
      to come again in contact with Philip upon ground so full of humbling
      recollections as that still overshadowed by the images of Gawtrey and
      Mary. He contented himself with writing an artful letter to Simon, stating
      that from Fanny&rsquo;s residence with Mr. Gawtrey, and from her likeness to her
      mother, whom he had only seen as a child, he had conjectured the
      relationship she bore to himself; and having obtained other evidence of
      that fact (he did not say what or where), he had not scrupled to remove
      her to his roof, meaning to explain all to Mr. Simon Gawtrey the next day.
      This letter was accompanied by one from a lawyer, informing Simon Gawtrey
      that Lord Lilburne would pay L200. a year, in quarterly payments, to his
      order; and that he was requested to add, that when the young lady he had
      so benevolently reared came of age, or married, an adequate provision
      would be made for her. Simon&rsquo;s mind blazed up at this last intelligence,
      when read to him, though he neither comprehended nor sought to know why
      Lord Lilburne should be so generous, or what that noble person&rsquo;s letter to
      himself was intended to convey. For two days, he seemed restored to
      vigorous sense; but when he had once clutched the first payment made in
      advance, the touch of the money seemed to numb him back to his lethargy:
      the excitement of desire died in the dull sense of possession.

      And just at that time Fanny&rsquo;s happiness came to a close. Philip received
      Arthur Beaufort&rsquo;s letter; and now ensued long and frequent absences; and
      on his return, for about an hour or so at a time, he spoke of sorrow and
      death; and the books were closed and the songs silenced. All fear for
      Fanny&rsquo;s safety was, of course, over; all necessity for her work; their
      little establishment was increased. She never stirred out without Sarah;
      yet she would rather that there had been some danger on her account for
      him to guard against, or some trial that his smile might soothe. His
      prolonged absences began to prey upon her&mdash;the books ceased to
      interest&mdash;no study filled up the dreary gap&mdash;her step grew
      listless&mdash;her cheek pale&mdash;she was sensible at last that his
      presence had become necessary to her very life. One day, he came to the
      house earlier than usual, and with a much happier and serener expression
      of countenance than he had worn of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon was dozing in his chair, with his old dog, now scarce vigorous
      enough to bark, curled up at his feet. Neither man nor dog was more as a
      witness to what was spoken than the leathern chair, or the hearth-rug, on
      which they severally reposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something which, in actual life, greatly contributed to the
      interest of Fanny&rsquo;s strange lot, but which, in narration, I feel I cannot
      make sufficiently clear to the reader. And this was her connection and
      residence with that old man. Her character forming, as his was completely
      gone; here, the blank becoming filled&mdash;there, the page fading to a
      blank. It was the utter, total Deathliness-in-Life of Simon, that, while
      so impressive to see, renders it impossible to bring him before the reader
      in his full force of contrast to the young Psyche. He seldom spoke&mdash;often,
      not from morning till night; he now seldom stirred. It is in vain to
      describe the indescribable: let the reader draw the picture for himself.
      And whenever (as I sometimes think he will, after he has closed this book)
      he conjures up the idea he attaches to the name of its heroine, let him
      see before her, as she glides through the humble room&mdash;as she listens
      to the voice of him she loves&mdash;as she sits musing by the window, with
      the church spire just visible&mdash;as day by day the soul brightens and
      expands within her&mdash;still let the reader see within the same walls,
      greyhaired, blind, dull to all feeling, frozen to all life, that stony
      image of Time and Death! Perhaps then he may understand why they who
      beheld the real and living Fanny blooming under that chill and mass of
      shadow, felt that her grace, her simplicity, her charming beauty, were
      raised by the contrast, till they grew associated with thoughts and
      images, mysterious and profound, belonging not more to the lovely than to
      the sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there sat the old man; and Philip, though aware of his presence,
      speaking as if he were alone with Fanny, after touching on more casual
      topics, thus addressed her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My true and my dear friend, it is to you that I shall owe, not only my
      rights and fortune, but the vindication of my mother&rsquo;s memory. You have
      not only placed flowers upon that gravestone, but it is owing to you,
      under Providence, that it will be inscribed at last with the Name which
      refutes all calumny. Young and innocent as you now are, my gentle and
      beloved benefactress, you cannot as yet know what a blessing it will be to
      me to engrave that Name upon that simple stone. Hereafter, when you
      yourself are a wife, a mother, you will comprehend the service you have
      rendered to the living and the dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped&mdash;struggling with the rush of emotions that overflowed his
      heart. Alas, THE DEAD! what service can we render to them?&mdash;what
      availed it now, either to the dust below, or to the immortality above,
      that the fools and knaves of this world should mention the Catherine whose
      life was gone, whose ears were deaf, with more or less respect? There is
      in calumny that poison that, even when the character throws off the
      slander, the heart remains diseased beneath the effect. They say that
      truth comes sooner or later; but it seldom comes before the soul, passing
      from agony to contempt, has grown callous to men&rsquo;s judgments. Calumniate a
      human being in youth&mdash;adulate that being in age;&mdash;what has been
      the interval? Will the adulation atone either for the torture, or the
      hardness which the torture leaves at last? And if, as in Catherine&rsquo;s case
      (a case, how common!), the truth come too late&mdash;if the tomb is closed&mdash;if
      the heart you have wrung can be wrung no more&mdash;why the truth is as
      valueless as the epitaph on a forgotten Name! Some such conviction of the
      hollowness of his own words, when he spoke of service to the dead, smote
      upon Philip&rsquo;s heart, and stopped the flow of his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, conscious only of his praise, his thanks, and the tender affection
      of his voice, stood still silent&mdash;her eyes downcast, her breast
      heaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Fanny, my honoured sister, I would thank you for more, were it
      possible, even than this. I shall owe to you not only name and fortune,
      but happiness. It is from the rights to which you have assisted me, and
      which will shortly be made clear, that I am able to demand a hand I have
      so long coveted&mdash;the hand of one as dear to me as you are. In a word,
      the time has, this day, been fixed, when I shall have a home to offer to
      you and to this old man&mdash;when I can present to you a sister who will
      prize you as I do: for I love you so dearly&mdash;I owe you so much&mdash;that
      even that home would lose half its smiles if you were not there. Do you
      understand me, Fanny? The sister I speak of will be my wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl who heard this speech of most cruel tenderness did not fall,
      or faint, or evince any outward emotion, except in a deadly paleness. She
      seemed like one turned to stone. Her very breath forsook her for some
      moments, and then came back with a long deep sigh. She laid her hand
      lightly on his arm, and said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I understand. We once saw a wedding. You are to be married&mdash;I
      shall see yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall; and, later, perhaps, I may see your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a brother. Ah! if I could but find him&mdash;younger than I am&mdash;beautiful
      almost as you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be happy,&rdquo; said Fanny, still calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long placed my hopes of happiness in such a union! Stay, where are
      you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pray for you,&rdquo; said Fanny, with a smile, in which there was something
      of the old vacancy, as she walked gently from the room. Philip followed
      her with moistened eyes. Her manner might have deceived one more vain. He
      soon after quitted the house, and returned to town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours after, Sarah found Fanny stretched on the floor of her own
      room&mdash;so still&mdash;so white&mdash;that, for some moments, the old
      woman thought life was gone. She recovered, however, by degrees; and,
      after putting her hands to her eyes, and muttering some moments, seemed
      much as usual, except that she was more silent, and that her lips remained
      colourless, and her hands cold like stone.

      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Vec. Ye see what follows.
   Duke. O gentle sir! this shape again!&rdquo;&mdash;The Chances.
</pre>
    <p>
      That evening Sidney Beaufort arrived in London. It is the nature of
      solitude to make passions calm on the surface&mdash;agitated in the deeps.
      Sidney had placed his whole existence in one object. When the letter
      arrived that told him to hope no more, he was at first rather sensible of
      the terrible and dismal blank&mdash;the &ldquo;void abyss&rdquo;&mdash;to which all
      his future was suddenly changed, than roused to vehement and turbulent
      emotion. But Camilla&rsquo;s letter had, as we have seen, raised his courage and
      animated his heart. To the idea of her faith he still clung with the
      instinct of hope in the midst of despair. The tidings that she was
      absolutely betrothed to another, and in so short a time since her
      rejection of him, let loose from all restraint his darker and more
      tempestuous passions. In a state of mind bordering upon frenzy, he hurried
      to London&mdash;to seek her&mdash;to see her; with what intent&mdash;what
      hope, if hope there were&mdash;he himself could scarcely tell. But what
      man who has loved with fervour and trust will be contented to receive the
      sentence of eternal separation except from the very lips of the one thus
      worshipped and thus foresworn?
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had been intensely cold. Towards evening the snow fell fast and
      heavily. Sidney had not, since a child, been before in London; and the
      immense City, covered with a wintry and icy mist, through which the
      hurrying passengers and the slow-moving vehicles passed, spectre-like,
      along the dismal and slippery streets&mdash;opened to the stranger no
      hospitable arms. He knew not a step of the way&mdash;he was pushed to and
      fro&mdash;his scarce intelligible questions impatiently answered&mdash;the
      snow covered him&mdash;the frost pierced to his veins. At length a man,
      more kindly than the rest, seeing that he was a stranger to London,
      procured him a hackney-coach, and directed the driver to the distant
      quarter of Berkeley Square. The snow balled under the hoofs of the horses&mdash;the
      groaning vehicle proceeded at the pace of a hearse. At length, and after a
      period of such suspense, and such emotion, as Sidney never in after-life
      could recall without a shudder, the coach stopped&mdash;the benumbed
      driver heavily descended&mdash;the sound of the knocker knelled loud
      through the muffled air&mdash;and the light from Mr. Beaufort&rsquo;s hall
      glared full upon the dizzy eyes of the visitor. He pushed aside the
      porter, and sprang into the hall. Luckily, one of the footmen who had
      attended Mrs. Beaufort to the Lakes recognised him; and, in answer to his
      breathless inquiry, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed, Mr. Spencer, Miss Beaufort is at home&mdash;up-stairs in the
      drawing-room, with master and mistress, and Monsieur de Vaudemont; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidney waited no more. He bounded up the stairs&mdash;he opened the first
      door that presented itself to him, and burst, unannounced and
      unlooked-for, upon the eyes of the group seated within. He saw not the
      terrified start of Mr. Robert Beaufort&mdash;he heeded not the faint,
      nervous exclamation of the mother&mdash;he caught not the dark and
      wondering glace of the stranger seated beside Camilla&mdash;he saw but
      Camilla herself, and in a moment he was at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Camilla, I am here!&mdash;I, who love you so&mdash;I, who have nothing in
      the world but you! I am here&mdash;to learn from you, and you alone, if I
      am indeed abandoned&mdash;if you are indeed to be another&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had dashed his hat from his brow as he sprang forward; his long fair
      hair, damp with the snows, fell disordered over his forehead; his eyes
      were fixed, as for life and death, upon the pale face and trembling lips
      of Camilla. Robert Beaufort, in great alarm, and well aware of the fierce
      temper of Philip, anticipative of some rash and violent impulse, turned
      his glance upon his destined son-in-law. But there was no angry pride in
      the countenance he there beheld. Philip had risen, but his frame was bent&mdash;his
      knees knocked together&mdash;his lips were parted&mdash;his eyes were
      staring full upon the face of the kneeling man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Camilla, sharing her father&rsquo;s fear, herself half rose, and with
      an unconscious pathos, stretched one hand, as if to shelter, over Sidney&rsquo;s
      head, and looked to Philip. Sidney&rsquo;s eyes followed hers. He sprang to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, it is true! And this is the man for whom I am abandoned! But
      unless you&mdash;you, with your own lips, tell me that you love me no more&mdash;that
      you love another&mdash;I will not yield you but with life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stalked sternly and impetuously up to Philip, who recoiled as his rival
      advanced. The characters of the two men seemed suddenly changed. The timid
      dreamer seemed dilated into the fearless soldier. The soldier seemed
      shrinking&mdash;quailing&mdash;into nameless terror. Sidney grasped that
      strong arm, as Philip still retreated, with his slight and delicate
      fingers, grasped it with violence and menace; and frowning into the face
      from which the swarthy blood was scared away, said, in a hollow whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear me? Do you comprehend me? I say that she shall not be forced
      into a marriage at which I yet believe her heart rebels. My claim is
      holier than yours. Renounce her, or win her but with my blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not apparently hear the words thus addressed to him. His whole
      senses seemed absorbed in the one sense of sight. He continued to gaze
      upon the speaker, till his eye dropped on the hand that yet griped his
      arm. And as he thus looked, he uttered an inarticulate cry. He caught the
      hand in his own, and pointed to a ring on the finger, but remained
      speechless. Mr. Beaufort approached, and began some stammered words of
      soothing to Sidney, but Philip motioned him to be silent, and, at last, as
      if by a violent effort, gasped forth, not to Sidney, but to Beaufort,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name?&mdash;his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Mr. Spencer&mdash;Mr. Charles Spencer,&rdquo; cried Beaufort. &ldquo;Listen to
      me, I will explain all&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush! cried Philip; and turning to Sidney, he put his hand on his
      shoulder, and looking him full in the face, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not known another name? Are you not&mdash;yes, it is so&mdash;it
      is&mdash;it is! Follow me&mdash;follow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still retaining his grasp, and leading Sidney, who was now subdued,
      awed, and a prey to new and wild suspicions, he moved on gently, stride by
      stride&mdash;his eyes fixed on that fair face&mdash;his lips muttering&mdash;till
      the closing door shut both forms from the eyes of the three there left.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the adjoining room into which Philip led his rival. It was lit but
      by a small reading-lamp, and the bright, steady blaze of the fire; and by
      this light they both continued to gaze on each other, as if spellbound, in
      complete silence. At last Philip, by an irresistible impulse, fell upon
      Sidney&rsquo;s bosom, and, clasping him with convulsive energy, gasped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney!&mdash;Sidney!&mdash;my mother&rsquo;s son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Sidney, struggling from the embrace, and at last freeing
      himself; &ldquo;it is you, then!&mdash;you, my own brother! You, who have been
      hitherto the thorn in my path, the cloud in my fate! You, who are now come
      to make me a wretch for life! I love that woman, and you tear her from me!
      You, who subjected my infancy to hardship, and, but for Providence, might
      have degraded my youth, by your example, into shame and guilt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forbear!&mdash;forbear!&rdquo; cried Philip, with a voice so shrill in its
      agony, that it smote the hearts of those in the adjoining chamber like the
      shriek of some despairing soul. They looked at each other, but not one had
      the courage to break upon the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidney himself was appalled by the sound. He threw himself on a seat, and,
      overcome by passions so new to him, by excitement so strange, hid his
      face, and sobbed as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip walked rapidly to and fro the room for some moments; at length he
      paused opposite to Sidney, and said, with the deep calmness of a wronged
      and goaded spirit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney Beaufort, hear me! When my mother died she confided you to my
      care, my love, and my protection. In the last lines that her hand traced,
      she bade me think less of myself than of you; to be to you as a father as
      well as brother. The hour that I read that letter I fell on my knees, and
      vowed that I would fulfil that injunction&mdash;that I would sacrifice my
      very self, if I could give fortune or happiness to you. And this not for
      your sake alone, Sidney; no! but as my mother&mdash;our wronged, our
      belied, our broken-hearted mother!&mdash;O Sidney, Sidney! have you no
      tears for her, too?&rdquo; He passed his hand over his own eyes for a moment,
      and resumed: &ldquo;But as our mother, in that last letter, said to me, &lsquo;let my
      love pass into your breast for him,&rsquo; so, Sidney, so, in all that I could
      do for you, I fancied that my mother&rsquo;s smile looked down upon me, and that
      in serving you it was my mother whom I obeyed. Perhaps, hereafter, Sidney,
      when we talk over that period of my earlier life when I worked for you,
      when the degradation you speak of (there was no crime in it!)&mdash;was
      borne cheerfully for your sake, and yours the holiday though mine the task&mdash;perhaps,
      hereafter, you will do me more justice. You left me, or were reft from me,
      and I gave all the little fortune that my mother had bequeathed us, to get
      some tidings from you. I received your letter&mdash;that bitter letter&mdash;and
      I cared not then that I was a beggar, since I was alone. You talk of what
      I have cost you&mdash;you talk! and you now ask me to&mdash;to&mdash;Merciful
      Heaven! let me understand you&mdash;do you love Camilla? Does she love
      you? Speak&mdash;speak&mdash;explain&mdash;what, new agony awaits me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Sidney, affected and humbled, amidst all his more selfish
      sorrows, by his brother&rsquo;s language and manner, related, as succinctly as
      he could, the history of his affection for Camilla, the circumstances of
      their engagement, and ended by placing before him the letter he had
      received from Mr. Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all his efforts for self-control, Philip&rsquo;s anguish was so
      great, so visible, that Sidney, after looking at his working features, his
      trembling hands, for a moment, felt all the earlier parts of his nature
      melt in a flow of generous sympathy and remorse. He flung himself on the
      breast from which he had shrunk before, and cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, brother! forgive me; I see how I have wronged you. If she has
      forgotten me, if she love you, take her and be happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip returned his embrace, but without warmth, and then moved away; and,
      again, in great disorder, paced the room. His brother only heard
      disjointed exclamations that seemed to escape him unawares: &ldquo;They said she
      loved me! Heaven give me strength! Mother&mdash;mother! let me fulfil my
      vow! Oh, that I had died ere this!&rdquo; He stopped at last, and the large dews
      rolled down his forehead. &ldquo;Sidney!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is a mystery here that
      I comprehend not. But my mind now is very confused. If she loves you&mdash;if!&mdash;is
      it possible for a woman to love two? Well, well, I go to solve the riddle:
      wait here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He vanished into the next room, and for nearly half an hour Sidney was
      alone. He heard through the partition murmured voices; he caught more
      clearly the sound of Camilla&rsquo;s sobs. The particulars of that interview
      between Philip and Camilla, alone at first (afterwards Mr. Robert Beaufort
      was re-admitted), Philip never disclosed, nor could Sidney himself ever
      obtain a clear account from Camilla, who could not recall it, even years
      after, without great emotion. But at last the door was opened, and Philip
      entered, leading Camilla by the hand. His face was calm, and there was a
      smile on his lips; a greater dignity than even that habitual to him was
      diffused over his whole person. Camilla was holding her handkerchief to
      her eyes and weeping passionately. Mr. Beaufort followed them with a
      mortified and slinking air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidney,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;it is past. All is arranged. I yield to your
      earlier, and therefore better, claim. Mr. Beaufort consents to your union.
      He will tell you, at some fitter time, that our birthright is at last made
      clear, and that there is no blot on the name we shall hereafter bear.
      Sidney, embrace your bride!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amazed, delighted, and still half incredulous, Sidney seized and kissed
      the hand of Camilla; and as he then drew her to his breast, she said, as
      she pointed to Philip:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you do love me as you say, see in him the generous, the noble&mdash;&rdquo;
       Fresh sobs broke off her speech; but as Sidney sought again to take her
      hand, she whispered, with a touching and womanly sentiment, &ldquo;Ah! respect
      him: see!&mdash;&rdquo; and Sidney, looking then at his brother, saw, that
      though he still attempted to smile, his lip writhed, and his features were
      drawn together, as one whose frame is wrung by torture, but who struggles
      not to groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flew to Philip, who, grasping his hand, held him back, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fulfilled my vow! I have given you up the only blessing my life
      has known. Enough, you are happy, and I shall be so too, when God pleases
      to soften this blow. And now you must not wonder or blame me, if, though
      so lately found, I leave you for a while. Do me one kindness,&mdash;you,
      Sidney&mdash;you, Mr. Beaufort. Let the marriage take place at H&mdash;&mdash;,
      in the village church by which my mother sleeps; let it be delayed till
      the suit is terminated: by that time I shall hope to meet you all&mdash;to
      meet you, Camilla, as I ought to meet my brother&rsquo;s wife; till then, my
      presence will not sadden your happiness. Do not seek to see me; do not
      expect to hear from me. Hist! be silent, all of you; my heart is yet
      bruised and sore. O THOU,&rdquo; and here, deepening his voice, he raised his
      arms, &ldquo;Thou who hast preserved my youth from such snares and such peril,
      who hast guided my steps from the abyss to which they wandered, and
      beneath whose hand I now bow, grateful if chastened, receive this
      offering, and bless that union! Fare ye well.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s airs amid the harpstrings dwell;
     And we wish they ne&rsquo;er may fade;
     They cease; and the soul is a silent cell,
     Where music never played.
     Dream follows dream through the long night-hours.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The self-command which Philip had obtained for a while deserted him when
      he was without the house. His mind felt broken up into chaos; he hurried
      on, mechanically, on foot; he passed street upon street, now solitary and
      deserted, as the lamps gleamed upon the thick snow. The city was left
      behind him. He paused not, till, breathless, and exhausted in spirit if
      not in frame, he reached the churchyard where Catherine&rsquo;s dust reposed.
      The snow had ceased to fall, but it lay deep over the graves; the
      yew-trees, clad in their white shrouds, gleamed ghost-like through the
      dimness. Upon the rail that fenced the tomb yet hung a wreath that Fanny&rsquo;s
      hand had placed there. But the flowers were hid; it was a wreath of snow!
      Through the intervals of the huge and still clouds, there gleamed a few
      melancholy stars. The very calm of the holy spot seemed unutterably sad.
      The Death of the year overhung the Death of man. And as Philip bent over
      the tomb, within and without all was ICE and NIGHT!
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours he remained on that spot, alone with his grief and absorbed in
      his prayer. Long past midnight Fanny heard his step on the stairs, and the
      door of his chamber close with unwonted violence. She heard, too, for some
      time, his heavy tread on the floor, till suddenly all was silent. The next
      morning, when, at the usual hour, Sarah entered to unclose the shutters
      and light the fire, she was startled by wild exclamations and wilder
      laughter. The fever had mounted to the brain&mdash;he was delirious.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several weeks Philip Beaufort was in imminent danger; for a
      considerable part of that time he was unconscious; and when the peril was
      past, his recovery was slow and gradual. It was the only illness to which
      his vigorous frame had ever been subjected: and the fever had perhaps
      exhausted him more than it might have done one in whose constitution the
      disease had encountered less resistance. His brother; imagining he had
      gone abroad, was unacquainted with his danger. None tended his sick-bed
      save the hireling nurse, the feed physician, and the unpurchasable heart
      of the only being to whom the wealth and rank of the Heir of Beaufort
      Court were as nothing. Here was reserved for him Fate&rsquo;s crowning lesson,
      in the vanity of those human wishes which anchor in gold and power. For
      how many years had the exile and the outcast pined indignantly for his
      birthright?&mdash;Lo! it was won: and with it came the crushed heart and
      the smitten frame. As he slowly recovered sense and reasoning, these
      thoughts struck him forcibly. He felt as if he were rightly punished in
      having disdained, during his earlier youth, the enjoyments within his
      reach. Was there nothing in the glorious health&mdash;the unconquerable
      hope&mdash;the heart, if wrung, and chafed, and sorely tried, free at
      least from the direst anguish of the passions, disappointed and jealous
      love? Though now certain, if spared to the future, to be rich, powerful,
      righted in name and honour, might he not from that sick-bed envy his
      earlier past? even when with his brother orphan he wandered through the
      solitary fields, and felt with what energies we are gifted when we have
      something to protect; or when, loving and beloved, he saw life smile out
      to him in the eyes of Eugenie; or when, after that melancholy loss, he
      wrestled boldly, and breast to breast with Fortune, in a far land, for
      honour and independence? There is something in severe illness, especially
      if it be in violent contrast to the usual strength of the body, which has
      often the most salutary effect upon the mind; which often, by the
      affliction of the frame, roughly wins us from the too morbid pains of the
      heart! which makes us feel that, in mere LIFE, enjoyed as the robust enjoy
      it, God&rsquo;s Great Principle of Good breathes and moves. We rise thus from
      the sick-bed softened and humbled, and more disposed to look around us for
      such blessings as we may yet command.
    </p>
    <p>
      The return of Philip, his danger, the necessity of exertion, of tending
      him, had roused Fanny from a state which might otherwise have been
      permanently dangerous to the intellect so lately ripened within her. With
      what patience, with what fortitude, with what unutterable thought and
      devotion, she fulfilled that best and holiest woman&rsquo;s duty&mdash;let the
      man whose struggle with life and death has been blessed with the vigil
      that wakes and saves, imagine to himself. And in all her anxiety and
      terror, she had glimpses of a happiness which it seemed to her almost
      criminal to acknowledge. For, even in his delirium, her voice seemed to
      have some soothing influence over him, and he was calmer while she was by.
      And when at last he was conscious, her face was the first he saw, and her
      name the first which his lips uttered. As then he grew gradually stronger,
      and the bed was deserted for the sofa, he took more than the old pleasure
      in hearing her read to him; which she did with a feeling that lecturers
      cannot teach. And once, in a pause from this occupation, he spoke to her
      frankly,&mdash;he sketched his past history&mdash;his last sacrifice. And
      Fanny, as she wept, learned that he was no more another&rsquo;s!
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that this man, naturally of an active and impatient
      temperament, had been little accustomed to seek those resources which are
      found in books. But somehow in that sick chamber&mdash;it was Fanny&rsquo;s
      voice&mdash;the voice of her over whose mind he had once so haughtily
      lamented, that taught him how much of aid and solace the Herd of Men
      derive from the Everlasting Genius of the Few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, and interval by interval, moment by moment, thus drawn
      together, all thought beyond shut out (for, however crushing for the time
      the blow that had stricken Philip from health and reason, he was not that
      slave to a guilty fancy, that he could voluntarily indulge&mdash;that he
      would not earnestly seek to shun&mdash;all sentiments that yet turned with
      unholy yearning towards the betrothed of his brother);&mdash;gradually, I
      say, and slowly, came those progressive and delicious epochs which mark a
      revolution in the affections:&mdash;unspeakable gratitude, brotherly
      tenderness, the united strength of compassion and respect that he had felt
      for Fanny seemed, as he gained health, to mellow into feelings yet more
      exquisite and deep. He could no longer delude himself with a vain and
      imperious belief that it was a defective mind that his heart protected; he
      began again to be sensible to the rare beauty of that tender face&mdash;more
      lovely, perhaps, for the paleness that had replaced its bloom. The fancy
      that he had so imperiously checked before&mdash;before he saw Camilla,
      returned to him, and neither pride nor honour had now the right to chase
      the soft wings away. One evening, fancying himself alone, he fell into a
      profound reverie; he awoke with a start, and the exclamation, &ldquo;was it true
      love that I ever felt for Camilla, or a passion, a frenzy, a delusion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His exclamation was answered by a sound that seemed both of joy and grief.
      He looked up, and saw Fanny before him; the light of the moon, just risen,
      fell full on her form, but her hands were clasped before her face; he
      heard her sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny, dear Fanny!&rdquo; he cried, and sought to throw himself from the sofa
      to her feet. But she drew herself away, and fled from the chamber silent
      as a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip rose, and, for the first time since his illness, walked, but with
      feeble steps, to and fro the room. With what different emotions from those
      in which last, in fierce and intolerable agony, he had paced that narrow
      boundary! Returning health crept through his veins&mdash;a serene, a
      kindly, a celestial joy circumfused his heart. Had the time yet come when
      the old Florimel had melted into snow; when the new and the true one, with
      its warm life, its tender beauty, its maiden wealth of love, had risen
      before his hopes? He paused before the window; the spot within seemed so
      confined, the night without so calm and lovely, that he forgot his
      still-clinging malady, and unclosed the casement: the air came soft and
      fresh upon his temples, and the church-tower and spire, for the first
      time, did not seem to him to rise in gloom against the heavens. Even the
      gravestone of Catherine, half in moonlight, half in shadow, appeared to
      him to wear a smile. His mother&rsquo;s memory was become linked with the living
      Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art vindicated&mdash;thy Sidney is happy,&rdquo; he murmured: &ldquo;to her the
      thanks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fair hopes, and soft thoughts busy within him, he remained at the casement
      till the increasing chill warned him of the danger he incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, when the physician visited him, he found the fever had
      returned. For many days, Philip was again in danger&mdash;dull,
      unconscious even of the step and voice of Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke at last as from a long and profound sleep; woke so refreshed, so
      revived, that he felt at once that some great crisis had been passed, and
      that at length he had struggled back to the sunny shores of Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his bedside sat Liancourt, who, long alarmed at his disappearance, had
      at last contrived, with the help of Mr. Barlow, to trace him to Gawtrey&rsquo;s
      house, and had for several days taken share in the vigils of poor Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was yet explaining all this to Philip, and congratulating him on
      his evident recovery, the physician entered to confirm the congratulation.
      In a few days the invalid was able to quit his room, and nothing but
      change of air seemed necessary for his convalescence. It was then that
      Liancourt, who had for two days seemed impatient to unburden himself of
      some communication, thus addressed him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My&mdash;My dear friend, I have learned now your story from Barlow, who
      called several times during your relapse; and who is the more anxious
      about you, as the time for the decision of your case now draws near. The
      sooner you quit this house the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit this house! and why? Is there not one in this house to whom I owe my
      fortune and my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and for that reason I say, &lsquo;Go hence:&rsquo; it is the only return you can
      make her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&mdash;speak intelligibly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Liancourt, gravely. &ldquo;I have been a watcher with her by your
      sick-bed, and I know what you must feel already:&mdash;nay, I must confess
      that even the old servant has ventured to speak to me. You have inspired
      that poor girl with feelings dangerous to her peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Philip, with such joy that Liancourt frowned, and said,
      &ldquo;Hitherto I have believed you too honourable to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think she loves me?&rdquo; interrupted Philip. &ldquo;Yes; what then? You, the
      heir of Beaufort Court, of a rental of L20,000. a year,&mdash;of an
      historical name,&mdash;you cannot marry this poor girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;I will consider what you say, and, at all events, I will
      leave the house to attend the result of the trial. Let us talk no more on
      the subject now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had the penetration to perceive that Liancourt, who was greatly
      moved by the beauty, the innocence, and the unprotected position of Fanny,
      had not confined caution to himself; that with his characteristic
      well-meaning bluntness, and with the license of a man somewhat advanced in
      years, he had spoken to Fanny herself: for Fanny now seemed to shun
      Philip,&mdash;her eyes were heavy, her manner was embarrassed. He saw the
      change, but it did not grieve him; he hailed the omens which he drew from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at last he and Liancourt went. He was absent three weeks, during which
      time the formality of the friendly lawsuit was decided in the plaintiff&rsquo;s
      favour; and the public were in ecstasies at the noble and sublime conduct
      of Mr. Robert Beaufort: who, the moment he had discovered a document which
      he might so easily have buried for ever in oblivion, voluntarily agreed to
      dispossess himself of estates he had so long enjoyed, preferring
      conscience to lucre. Some persons observed that it was reported that Mr.
      Philip Beaufort had also been generous&mdash;that he had agreed to give up
      the estates for his uncle&rsquo;s life, and was only in the meanwhile to receive
      a fourth of the revenues. But the universal comment was, &ldquo;He could not
      have done less!&rdquo; Mr. Robert Beaufort was, as Lord Lilburne had once
      observed, a man who was born, made, and reared to be spoken well of by the
      world; and it was a comfort to him now, poor man, to feel that his
      character was so highly estimated. If Philip should live to the age of one
      hundred, he will never become so respectable and popular a man with the
      crowd as his worthy uncle. But does it much matter? Philip returned to H&mdash;&mdash;
      the eve before the day fixed for the marriage of his brother and Camilla.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     From Night, Sunshine and Day arose&mdash;HES
</pre>
    <p>
      The sun of early May shone cheerfully over the quiet suburb of H&mdash;&mdash;.
      In the thoroughfares life was astir. It was the hour of noon&mdash;the
      hour at which commerce is busy, and streets are full. The old retired
      trader, eying wistfully the rolling coach or the oft-pausing omnibus, was
      breathing the fresh and scented air in the broadest and most crowded road,
      from which, afar in the distance, rose the spires of the metropolis. The
      boy let loose from the day-school was hurrying home to dinner, his satchel
      on his back: the ballad-singer was sending her cracked whine through the
      obscurer alleys, where the baker&rsquo;s boy, with puddings on his tray, and the
      smart maid-servant, despatched for porter, paused to listen. And round the
      shops where cheap shawls and cottons tempted the female eye, many a
      loitering girl detained her impatient mother, and eyed the tickets and
      calculated her hard-gained savings for the Sunday gear. And in the corners
      of the streets steamed the itinerant kitchens of the piemen, and rose the
      sharp cry, &ldquo;All hot! all hot!&rdquo; in the ear of infant and ragged hunger. And
      amidst them all rolled on some lazy coach of ancient merchant or withered
      maiden, unconscious of any life but that creeping through their own
      languid veins. And before the house in which Catherine died, there
      loitered many stragglers, gossips, of the hamlet, subscribers to the
      news-room hard by, to guess, and speculate, and wonder why, from the
      church behind, there rose the merry peal of the marriage-bell!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length along the broad road leading from the great city, there were
      seen rapidly advancing three carriages of a very different fashion from
      those familiar to the suburb. On they came; swiftly they whirled round the
      angle that conducted to the church; the hoofs of the gay steeds ringing
      cheerily on the ground; the white favours of the servants gleaming in the
      sun. Happy is the bride the sun shines on! And when the carriages had thus
      vanished, the scattered groups melted into one crowd, and took their way
      to the church. They stood idling without in the burial-ground; many of
      them round the fence that guarded from their footsteps Catherine&rsquo;s lonely
      grave. All in nature was glad, exhilarating, and yet serene; a genial
      freshness breathed through the soft air; not a cloud was to be seen in the
      smiling azure; even the old dark yews seemed happy in their everlasting
      verdure. The bell ceased, and then even the crowd grew silent; and not a
      sound was heard in that solemn spot to whose demesnes are consecrated
      alike the Birth, the Marriage, and the Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length there came forth from the church door the goodly form of a rosy
      beadle. Approaching the groups, he whispered the better-dressed and
      commanded the ragged, remonstrated with the old and lifted his cane
      against the young; and the result of all was, that the churchyard, not
      without many a murmur and expostulation, was cleared, and the crowd fell
      back in the space behind the gates of the principal entrance, where they
      swayed and gaped and chattered round the carriages, which were to bear
      away the bridal party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the church, as the ceremony was now concluded, Philip Beaufort
      conducted, hand-in-hand, silently along the aisle, his brother&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning on his stick, his cold sneer upon his thin lip, Lord Lilburne
      limped, step by step, with the pair, though a little apart from them,
      glancing from moment to moment at the face of Philip Beaufort, where he
      had hoped to read a grief that he could not detect. Lord Lilburne had
      carefully refrained from an interview with Philip till that day, and he
      now only came to the wedding as a surgeon goes to an hospital, to examine
      a disease he had been told would be great and sore: he was disappointed.
      Close behind followed Sidney, radiant with joy, and bloom, and beauty; and
      his kind guardian, the tears rolling down his eyes, murmured blessings as
      he looked upon him. Mrs. Beaufort had declined attending the ceremony&mdash;her
      nerves were too weak&mdash;but, behind, at a longer interval, came Robert
      Beaufort, sober, staid, collected as ever to outward seeming; but a close
      observer might have seen that his eye had lost its habitual complacent
      cunning, that his step was more heavy, his stoop more joyless. About his
      air there was a some thing crestfallen. The consciousness of acres had
      passed away from his portly presence. He was no longer a possessor, but a
      pensioner. The rich man, who had decided as he pleased on the happiness of
      others, was a cipher; he had ceased to have any interest in anything. What
      to him the marriage of his daughter now? Her children would not be the
      heirs of Beaufort. As Camilla kindly turned round, and through happy tears
      waited for his approach, to clasp his hand, he forced a smile, but it was
      sickly and piteous. He longed to creep away, and be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; said Camilla, in her sweet low voice; and she extricated
      herself from Philip, and threw herself on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a good child,&rdquo; said Robert Beaufort vacantly, and, turning his dry
      eyes to the group, he caught instinctively at his customary commonplaces;&mdash;&ldquo;and
      a good child, Mr. Sidney, makes a good wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman bowed as if the compliment were addressed to himself: he was
      the only man there whom Robert Beaufort could now deceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister,&rdquo; said Philip Beaufort, as once more leaning on his arm, they
      paused before the church door, &ldquo;may Sidney love and prize you as&mdash;as
      I would have done; and believe me, both of you, I have no regret, no
      memory, that wounds me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the hand, and motioned to her father to load her to the
      carriage. Then winding his arm into Sidney&rsquo;s, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till they are gone: I have one word yet with you. Go on, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman bowed, and walked through the churchyard. But Lilburne,
      pausing and surveying Philip Beaufort, said to him, whisperingly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so much for feeling&mdash;the folly! So much for generosity&mdash;the
      delusion! Happy man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thoroughly happy, Lord Lilburne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&mdash;Then, it was neither feeling nor generosity; and we were
      taken in! Good day.&rdquo; With that he limped slowly to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip answered not the sarcasm even by a look. For at that moment a loud
      shout was set up by the mob without&mdash;they had caught a glimpse of the
      bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Sidney, this way.&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I must not detain you long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arm in arm they passed out of the church, and turned to the spot hard by,
      where the flowers smiled up to them from the stone on their mother&rsquo;s
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old inscription had been effaced, and the name of CATHERINE BEAUFORT
      was placed upon the stone. &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;do not forget this
      grave: years hence, when children play around your own hearth. Observe,
      the name of Catherine Beaufort is fresher on the stone than the dates of
      birth and death&mdash;the name was only inscribed there to-day&mdash;your
      wedding-day. Brother, by this grave we are now indeed united.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Philip!&rdquo; cried Sidney, in deep emotion, clasping the hand stretched
      out to him; &ldquo;I feel, I feel how noble, how great you are&mdash;that you
      have sacrificed more than I dreamed of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Philip, with a smile. &ldquo;No talk of this. I am happier than you
      deem me. Go back now&mdash;she waits you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&mdash;leave you!&mdash;alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not alone,&rdquo; said Philip, pointing to the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had he spoken when, from the gate, came the shrill, clear voice of
      Lord Lilburne,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wait for Mr. Sidney Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidney passed his hand over his eyes, wrung the hand of his brother once
      more, and in a moment was by Camilla&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another shout&mdash;the whirl of the wheels&mdash;the trampling of feet&mdash;the
      distant hum and murmur&mdash;and all was still. The clerk returned to lock
      up the church&mdash;he did not observe where Philip stood in the shadow of
      the wall&mdash;and went home to talk of the gay wedding, and inquire at
      what hour the funeral of the young woman; his next-door neighbour, would
      take place the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be a quarter of an hour after Philip was thus left&mdash;nor had
      he moved from the spot&mdash;when he felt his sleeve pulled gently. He
      turned round and saw before him the wistful face of Fanny!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you would not come to the wedding?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I fancied you might be here alone&mdash;and sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will not even wear the dress I gave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time. Tell me, are you unhappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy, Fanny! No; look around. The very burial-ground has a smile. See
      the laburnums clustering over the wall, listen to the birds on the dark
      yews above, and yonder see even the butterfly has settled upon her grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not unhappy.&rdquo; As he thus spoke he looked at her earnestly, and
      taking both her hands in his, drew her gently towards him, and continued:
      &ldquo;Fanny, do you remember, that, leaning over that gate, I once spoke to you
      of the happiness of marriage where two hearts are united? Nay, Fanny, nay,
      I must go on. It was here in this spot,&mdash;it was here that I first saw
      you on my return to England. I came to seek the dead, and I have thought
      since, it was my mother&rsquo;s guardian spirit that drew me hither to find you&mdash;the
      living! And often afterwards, Fanny, you would come with me here, when,
      blinded and dull as I was, I came to brood and to repine, insensible of
      the treasures even then perhaps within my reach. But, best as it was: the
      ordeal through which I have passed has made me more grateful for the prize
      I now dare to hope for. On this grave your hand daily renewed the flowers.
      By this grave, the link between the Time and the Eternity, whose lessons
      we have read together, will you consent to record our vows? Fanny,
      dearest, fairest, tenderest, best, I love you, and at last as alone you
      should be loved!&mdash;I woo you as my wife! Mine, not for a season, but
      for ever&mdash;for ever, even when these graves are open, and the World
      shrivels like a scroll. Do you understand me?&mdash;do you heed me?&mdash;or
      have I dreamed that that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short&mdash;a dismay seized him at her silence. Had he been
      mistaken in his divine belief!&mdash;the fear was momentary: for Fanny,
      who had recoiled as he spoke, now placing her hands to her temples, gazing
      on him, breathlessly and with lips apart, as if, indeed, with great effort
      and struggle her modest spirit conceived the possibility of the happiness
      that broke upon it, advanced timidly, her face suffused in blushes; and,
      looking into his eyes, as if she would read into his very soul, said, with
      an accent, the intenseness of which showed that her whole fate hung on his
      answer,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is pity?&mdash;they have told you that I&mdash;in short, you are
      generous&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;Oh, deceive me not! Do you love her
      still?&mdash;Can you&mdash;do you love the humble, foolish Fanny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As God shall judge me, sweet one, I am sincere! I have survived a passion&mdash;never
      so deep, so tender, so entire as that I now feel for you! And, oh, Fanny,
      hear this true confession. It was you&mdash;you to whom my heart turned
      before I saw Camilla!&mdash;against that impulse I struggled in the
      blindness of a haughty error!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fanny uttered a low and suppressed cry of delight and rapture. Philip
      passionately continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanny, make blessed the life you have saved. Fate destined us for each
      other. Fate for me has ripened your sweet mind. Fate for you has softened
      this rugged heart. We may have yet much to bear and much to learn. We will
      console and teach each other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew her to his breast as he spoke&mdash;drew her trembling, blushing,
      confused, but no more reluctant; and there, by the GRAVE that had been so
      memorable a scene in their common history, were murmured those vows in
      which all this world knows of human happiness is treasured and recorded&mdash;love
      that takes the sting from grief, and faith that gives eternity to love.
      All silent, yet all serene around them! Above, the heaven,&mdash;at their
      feet, the grave:&mdash;For the love, the grave!&mdash;for the faith, the
      heaven!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;A labore reclinat otium.&rdquo;&mdash;HORAT.

        [Leisure unbends itself from labour.]
</pre>
    <p>
      I feel that there is some justice in the affection the general reader
      entertains for the old-fashioned and now somewhat obsolete custom, of
      giving to him, at the close of a work, the latest news of those who sought
      his acquaintance through its progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weak but well-meaning Smith, no more oppressed by the evil influence
      of his brother, has continued to pass his days in comfort and
      respectability on the income settled on him by Philip Beaufort. Mr. and
      Mrs. Roger Morton still live, and have just resigned their business to
      their eldest son; retiring themselves to a small villa adjoining the town
      in which they had made their fortune. Mrs. Morton is very apt, when she
      goes out to tea, to talk of her dear deceased sister-in-law, the late Mrs.
      Beaufort, and of her own remarkable kindness to her nephew when a little
      boy. She observes that, in fact, the young men owe everything to Mr. Roger
      and herself; and, indeed, though Sidney was never of a grateful
      disposition, and has not been near her since, yet the elder brother, the
      Mr. Beaufort, always evinces his respect to them by the yearly present of
      a fat buck. She then comments on the ups and downs of life; and observes
      that it is a pity her son Tom preferred the medical profession to the
      church. Their cousin, Mr. Beaufort, has two livings. To all this Mr. Roger
      says nothing, except an occasional &ldquo;Thank Heaven, I want no man&rsquo;s help! I
      am as well to do as my neighbours. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are some readers&mdash;they who do not thoroughly consider the
      truths of this life&mdash;who will yet ask, &ldquo;But how is Lord Lilburne
      punished?&rdquo; Punished?&mdash;ay, and indeed, how? The world, and not the
      poet, must answer that question. Crime is punished from without. If Vice
      is punished, it must be from within. The Lilburnes of this hollow world
      are not to be pelted with the soft roses of poetical justice. They who ask
      why he is not punished may be the first to doff the hat to the equipage in
      which my lord lolls through the streets! The only offence he habitually
      committed of a nature to bring the penalties of detection, he renounced
      the moment he perceived there was clanger of discovery! he gambled no more
      after Philip&rsquo;s hint. He was one of those, some years after, most bitter
      upon a certain nobleman charged with unfair play&mdash;one of those who
      took the accusation as proved; and whose authority settled all disputes
      thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, if no thunderbolt falls on Lord Lilburne&rsquo;s head&mdash;if he is fated
      still to eat, and drink, and to die on his bed, he may yet taste the ashes
      of the Dead Sea fruit which his hands have culled. He is grown old. His
      infirmities increase upon him; his sole resources of pleasure&mdash;the
      senses&mdash;are dried up. For him there is no longer savour in the
      viands, or sparkle in the wine,&mdash;man delights him not, nor woman
      neither. He is alone with Old Age, and in the sight of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of Simon, who died in his chair not many days after
      Sidney&rsquo;s marriage, Robert Beaufort is the only one among the more
      important agents left at the last scene of this history who has passed
      from our mortal stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the marriage of his daughter he for some time moped and drooped. But
      Philip learned from Mr. Blackwell of the will that Robert had made
      previously to the lawsuit; and by which, had the lawsuit failed, his
      rights would yet have been preserved to him. Deeply moved by a generosity
      he could not have expected from his uncle, and not pausing to inquire too
      closely how far it was to be traced to the influence of Arthur, Philip so
      warmly expressed his gratitude, and so surrounded Mr. Beaufort with
      affectionate attentions, that the poor man began to recover his
      self-respect,&mdash;began even to regard the nephew he had so long
      dreaded, as a son,&mdash;to forgive him for not marrying Camilla. And,
      perhaps, to his astonishment, an act in his life for which the customs of
      the world (that never favour natural ties not previously sanctioned by the
      legal) would have rather censured than praised, became his consolation;
      and the memory he was most proud to recall. He gradually recovered his
      spirits; he was very fond of looking over that will: he carefully
      preserved it: he even flattered himself that it was necessary to preserve
      Philip from all possible litigation hereafter; for if the estates were not
      legally Philip&rsquo;s, why, then, they were his to dispose of as he pleased. He
      was never more happy than when his successor was by his side; and was
      certainly a more cheerful and, I doubt not, a better man&mdash;during the
      few years in which he survived the law-suit&mdash;than ever he had been
      before. He died&mdash;still member for the county, and still quoted as a
      pattern to county members&mdash;in Philip&rsquo;s arms; and on his lips there
      was a smile that even Lilburne would have called sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Beaufort, after her husband&rsquo;s death, established herself in London;
      and could never be persuaded to visit Beaufort Court. She took a
      companion, who more than replaced, in her eyes, the absence of Camilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Camilla-Spencer-Sidney. They live still by the gentle Lake, happy in
      their own serene joys and graceful leisure; shunning alike ambition and
      its trials, action and its sharp vicissitudes; envying no one, covetous of
      nothing; making around them, in the working world, something of the old
      pastoral and golden holiday. If Camilla had at one time wavered in her
      allegiance to Sidney, her good and simple heart has long since been
      entirely regained by his devotion; and, as might be expected from her
      disposition, she loved him better after marriage than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had gone through severer trials than Sidney. But, had their earlier
      fates been reversed, and that spirit, in youth so haughty and self-willed,
      been lapped in ease and luxury, would Philip now be a better or a happier
      man? Perhaps, too, for a less tranquil existence than his brother, Philip
      yet may be reserved; but, in proportion to the uses of our destiny, do we
      repose or toil: he who never knows pain knows but the half of pleasure.
      The lot of whatever is most noble on the earth below falls not amidst the
      rosy Gardels of the Epicurean. We may envy the man who enjoys and rests;
      but the smile of Heaven settles rather on the front of him who labours and
      aspires.
    </p>
    <p>
      And did Philip ever regret the circumstances that had given him Fanny for
      the partner of his life? To some who take their notions of the Ideal from
      the conventional rules of romance, rather than from their own perceptions
      of what is true, this narrative would have been more pleasing had Philip
      never loved but Fanny. But all that had led to that love had only served
      to render it more enduring and concentred. Man&rsquo;s strongest and worthiest
      affection is his last&mdash;is the one that unites and embodies all his
      past dreams of what is excellent&mdash;the one from which Hope springs out
      the brighter from former disappointments&mdash;the one in which the
      MEMORIES are the most tender and the most abundant&mdash;the one which,
      replacing all others, nothing hereafter can replace.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         ......
</pre>
    <p>
      And now ere the scene closes, and the audience, whom perhaps the actors
      may have interested for a while, disperse, to forget amidst the pursuits
      of actual life the Shadows that have amused an hour, or beguiled a care,
      let the curtain fall on one happy picture:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is some years after the marriage of Philip and Fanny. It is a summer
      morning. In a small old-fashioned room at Beaufort Court, with its
      casements open to the gardens, stood Philip, having just entered; and near
      the window sat Fanny, his boy by her side. She was at the mother&rsquo;s hardest
      task&mdash;the first lessons to the first-born child; and as the boy
      looked up at her sweet earnest face with a smile of intelligence on his
      own, you might have seen at a glance how well understood were the teacher
      and the pupil. Yes: whatever might have been wanting in the Virgin to the
      full development of mind, the cares of the mother had supplied. When a
      being was born to lean on her alone&mdash;dependent on her providence for
      life&mdash;then hour after hour, step after step, in the progress of
      infant destinies, had the reason of the mother grown in the child&rsquo;s
      growth, adapting itself to each want that it must foresee, and taking its
      perfectness and completion from the breath of the New Love!
    </p>
    <p>
      The child caught sight of Philip and rushed to embrace him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See!&rdquo; whispered Fanny, as she also hung upon him, and strange
      recollections of her own mysterious childhood crowded upon her,&mdash;&ldquo;See,&rdquo;
       whispered she, with a blush half of shame and half of pride, &ldquo;the poor
      idiot girl is the teacher of your child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; answered Philip, &ldquo;whether for child or mother, what teacher is like
      Love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, he took the boy into his arms; and, as he bent over those
      rosy cheeks, Fanny saw, from the movement of his lips and the moisture in
      his eyes, that he blessed God. He looked upon the mother&rsquo;s face, he
      glanced round on the flowers and foliage of the luxurious summer, and
      again he blessed God: And without and within, it was Light and MORNING!
    </p>

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
