      <br /> <br /> TO COUNT ALFRED D'ORSAY. MY DEAR COUNT D'ORSAY,
    </p>
    <p>
      When the parentage of Godolphin was still unconfessed and unknown, you
      were pleased to encourage his first struggles with the world: Now, will
      you permit the father he has just discovered to re-introduce him to your
      notice? I am sorry to say, however, that my unfilial offspring, having
      been so long disowned, is not sufficiently grateful for being acknowledged
      at last: he says that he belongs to a very numerous family, and, wishing
      to be distinguished from his brothers, desires not only to reclaim your
      acquaintance, but to borrow your name. Nothing less will content his
      ambition than the most public opportunity in his power of parading his
      obligations to the most accomplished gentleman of our time. Will you,
      then, allow him to make his new appearance in the world under your wing,
      and thus suffer the son as well as the father to attest the kindness of
      your heart and to boast the honour of your friendship?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              Believe me,
                         My dear Count d'Orsay,
                              With the sincerest regard,
                         Yours, very faithfully and truly,
                                                E. B. L.

    <h2>
      PREFACE TO GODOLPHIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the Prefaces to this edition of my works, I have occasionally so far
      availed myself of that privilege of self-criticism which the French comic
      writer, Mons. Picord, maintains or exemplifies in the collection of his
      plays,&mdash;as, if not actually to sit in judgment on my own
      performances, still to insinuate some excuse for their faults by
      extenuatory depositions as to their character and intentions. Indeed, a
      writer looking back to the past is unconsciously inclined to think that he
      may separate himself from those children of his brain which have long gone
      forth to the world; and though he may not expatiate on the merits his
      paternal affection would ascribe to them, that he may speak at least of
      the mode in which they were trained and reared&mdash;of the hopes he
      cherished, or the objects he entertained, when he finally dismissed them
      to the opinions of others and the ordeal of Fate or Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I own that even when I have thought but little of the value
      of a work, I have always felt an interest in the author's account of its
      origin and formation, and, willing to suppose that what thus affords a
      gratification to my own curiosity, may not be wholly unattractive to
      others, I shall thus continue from time to time to play the Showman to my
      own machinery, and explain the principle of the mainspring and the
      movement of the wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      This novel was begun somewhere in the third year of my authorship, and
      completed in the fourth. It was, therefore, composed almost simultaneously
      with Eugene Aram, and afforded to me at least some relief from the gloom
      of that village tragedy. It is needless to observe how dissimilar in point
      of scene, character, and fable, the one is from the other; yet they are
      alike in this&mdash;that both attempt to deal with one of the most
      striking problems in the spiritual history of man, viz., the frustration
      or abuse of power in a superior intellect originally inclined to good.
      Perhaps there is no problem that more fascinates the attention of a man of
      some earnestness at that period of his life, when his eye first disengages
      itself from the external phenomena around him, and his curiosity leads him
      to examine the cause and account for the effect;&mdash;when, to cite
      reverently the words of the wisest, "He applies his heart to know and to
      search, and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things, and to know the
      wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Eugene Aram, the natural career of genius is arrested by a single
      crime; in Godolphin, a mind of inferior order, but more fanciful
      colouring, is wasted away by the indulgence of those morbid sentiments
      which are the nourishment of egotism, and the gradual influence of the
      frivolities which make the business of the idle. Here the Demon tempts or
      destroys the hermit in his solitary cell. There, he glides amidst the
      pomps and vanities of the world, and whispers away the soul in the voice
      of his soft familiars, Indolence and Pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all my numerous novels, Pelham and Godolphin are the only ones which
      take their absolute groundwork in what is called "The Fashionable World."
      I have sought in each to make the general composition in some harmony with
      the principal figure in the foreground. Pelham is represented as almost
      wholly unsusceptible to the more poetical influences. He has the physical
      compound, which, versatile and joyous, amalgamates easily with the world&mdash;he
      views life with the lenient philosophy that Horace commends in Aristippus:
      he laughs at the follies he shares; and is ever ready to turn into uses
      ultimately (if indirectly) serious, the frivolities that only serve to
      sharpen his wit, and augment that peculiar expression which we term
      "knowledge of the world." In a word, dispel all his fopperies, real or
      assumed, he is still the active man of crowds and cities, determined to
      succeed, and gifted with the ordinary qualities of success. Godolphin, on
      the contrary, is the man of poetical temperament, out of his place alike
      among the trifling idlers and the bustling actors of the world&mdash;wanting
      the stimulus of necessity&mdash;or the higher motive which springs from
      benevolence, to give energy to his powers, or definite purpose to his
      fluctuating desires; not strong enough to break the bonds that confine his
      genius&mdash;not supple enough to accommodate its movements to their
      purpose. He is the moral antipodes to Pelham. In evading the struggles of
      the world, he grows indifferent to its duties&mdash;he strives with no
      obstacles&mdash;he can triumph in no career. Represented as possessing
      mental qualities of a higher and a richer nature than those to which
      Pelham can pretend, he is also represented as very inferior to him in
      constitution of character, and he is certainly a more ordinary type of the
      intellectual trifler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters grouped around Godolphin are those with which such a man
      usually associates his life. They are designed to have a certain grace&mdash;a
      certain harmony with one form or the other of his twofold temperament:&mdash;viz.,
      either its conventional elegance of taste, or its constitutional poetry of
      idea. But all alike are brought under varying operations of similar
      influences; or whether in Saville, Constance, Fanny, or Lucilla&mdash;the
      picture presented is still the picture of gifts misapplied&mdash;of life
      misunderstood. The Preacher who exclaimed, "Vanity of vanities! all is
      vanity," perhaps solved his own mournful saying, when he added elsewhere,
      "This only have I found, that God made men upright&mdash;but they have
      sought out many inventions."
    </p>
    <p>
      This work was first published anonymously, and for that reason perhaps it
      has been slow in attaining to its rightful station amongst its brethren&mdash;whose
      parentage at first was openly acknowledged. If compared with Pelham, it
      might lose, at the first glance, but would perhaps gain on any attentive
      reperusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      For although it must follow from the inherent difference in the design of
      the two works thus referred to, that in Godolphin there can be little of
      the satire or vivacity which have given popularity to its predecessor,
      yet, on the other hand, in Godolphin there ought to be a more faithful
      illustration of the even polish that belongs to luxurious life,&mdash;of
      the satiety that pleasure inflicts upon such of its votaries as are worthy
      of a higher service. The subject selected cannot adroit the same facility
      for observation of things that lie on the surface&mdash;but it may well
      lend itself to subtler investigation of character&mdash;allow more attempt
      at pathos, and more appeal to reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarded as a story, the defects of Godolphin most apparent to myself, are
      in the manner in which Lucilla is re-introduced in the later chapters, and
      in the final catastrophe of the hero. There is an exaggerated romance in
      the one, and the admission of accident as a crowning agency in the other,
      which my maturer judgment would certainly condemn, and which at all events
      appear to me out of keeping with the natural events, and the more patient
      investigation of moral causes and their consequences, from which the
      previous interest of the tale is sought to be attained. On the other hand,
      if I may presume to conjecture the most probable claim to favour which the
      work, regarded as a whole, may possess&mdash;it may possibly be found in a
      tolerably accurate description of certain phases of modern civilisation,
      and in the suggestion of some truths that may be worth considering in our
      examination of social influences or individual conduct.

    </p>
    <p>
      "Open the shutters wider, there. It <i>is</i> a beautiful night. How
      beautiful! Come hither, my child."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rich moonlight that now shone through the windows streamed on little
      that it could invest with poetical attraction. The room was small, though
      not squalid in its character and appliances. The bed-curtains, of a dull
      chintz, were drawn back, and showed the form of a man, past middle age,
      propped by pillows, and bearing on his countenance the marks of
      approaching death. But what a countenance it still was! The broad, pale,
      lofty brow; the fine, straight, Grecian nose; the short, curved lip; the
      full, dimpled chin; the stamp of genius in every line and lineament;&mdash;these
      still defied disease, or rather borrowed from its very ghastliness a more
      impressive majesty. Beside the bed was a table spread with books of a
      motley character. Here an abstruse system of Calculations on Finance;
      there a volume of wild Bacchanalian Songs; here the lofty aspirations of
      Plato's Phoedon; and there the last speech of some County Paris on a Malt
      Tax: old newspapers and dusty pamphlets completed the intellectual litter;
      and above them rose, mournfully enough, the tall, spectral form of a
      half-emptied phial, and a chamber-candlestick, crested by its
      extinguisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      A light step approached the bedside, and opposite the dying man now stood
      a girl, who might have seen her thirteenth year. But her features&mdash;of
      an exceeding, and what may be termed a regal beauty&mdash;were as fully
      developed as those of one who had told twice her years; and not a trace of
      the bloom or the softness of girlhood could be marked on her countenance.
      Her complexion was pale as the whitest marble, but clear, and lustrous;
      and her raven hair, parted over her brow in a fashion then uncommon,
      increased the statue-like and classic effect of her noble features. The
      expression of her countenance seemed cold, sedate, and somewhat stern; but
      it might, in some measure, have belied her heart; for, when turned to the
      moonlight, you might see that her eyes were filled with tears, though she
      did not weep; and you might tell by the quivering of her lip, that a
      little hesitation in replying to any remark from the sufferer arose from
      her difficulty in commanding her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Constance," said the invalid, after a pause, in which he seemed to have
      been gazing with a quiet heart on the soft skies, that, blue and eloquent
      with stars, he beheld through the unclosed windows:&mdash;"Constance, the
      hour is coming; I feel it by signs which I cannot mistake. I shall die
      this night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, God!&mdash;my father!&mdash;my dear, dear father!" broke from
      Constance's lips; "do not speak thus&mdash;do not&mdash;I will go to
      Doctor &mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, child, no!&mdash;I loathe&mdash;I detest the thought of help. They
      denied it me while it was yet time. They left me to starve or to rot in
      gaol, or to hang myself! They left me like a dog, and like a dog I will
      die! I would not have one iota taken from the justice&mdash;the deadly and
      dooming weight of my dying curse." Here violent spasms broke on the speech
      of the sufferer; and when, by medicine and his daughter's attentions, he
      had recovered, he said, in a lower and calmer key:&mdash;"Is all quiet
      below, Constance? Are all in bed? The landlady&mdash;the servants&mdash;our
      fellow-lodgers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All, my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay; then I shall die happy. Thank Heaven, you are my only nurse and
      attendant. I remember the day when I was ill after one of their rude
      debauches. Ill!&mdash;a sick headache&mdash;a fit of the spleen&mdash;a
      spoiled lapdog's illness! Well: they wanted me that night to support one
      of their paltry measures&mdash;their parliamentary measures. And I had a
      prince feeling my pulse, and a duke mixing my draught, and a dozen earls
      sending their doctors to me. I was of use to them then! Poor me! Read me
      that note, Constance&mdash;Flamborough's note. Do you hesitate? Read it, I
      say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance trembled and complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Vernon,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am really au desespoir to hear of your melancholy state;&mdash;so sorry
      I cannot assist you: but you know my embarrassed circumstances. By the by,
      I saw his Royal Highness yesterday. 'Poor Vernon!' said he; 'would a
      hundred pounds do him any good?' So we don't forget you, mon cher. Ah! how
      we missed you at the Beefsteak! Never shall we know again so glorious a
      bona vivant. You would laugh to hear L&mdash;&mdash; attempting to echo
      your old jokes. But time presses: I must be off to the House. You know
      what a motion it is! Would to Heaven you were to bring it on instead of
      that ass T&mdash;&mdash;. Adieu! I wish I could come and see you; but it
      would break my heart. Can I send you any books from Hookham's?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours ever,
    </p>
    <p>
      "FLAMBOROUGH."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the man whom I made Secretary of State," said Vernon. "Very well!&mdash;oh,
      it's very well,&mdash;very well indeed. Let me kiss thee, my girl. Poor
      Constance! You will have good friends when I am dead! they will be proud
      enough to be kind to Vernon's daughter, when Death has shown them that
      Vernon is a loss. You are very handsome. Your poor mother's eyes and hair&mdash;my
      father's splendid brow and lip; and your figure, even now so stately! They
      will court you: you will have lords and great men enough at your feet; but
      you will never forget this night, nor the agony of your father's death-bed
      face, and the brand they have burned in his heart. And now, Constance,
      give me the Bible in which you read to me this morning: that will do:&mdash;stand
      away from the light and fix your eyes on mine, and listen as if your soul
      were in your ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I was a young man, toiling my way to fortune through the labours of
      the Bar,&mdash;prudent, cautious, indefatigable, confident of success,&mdash;certain
      lords, who heard I possessed genius, and thought I might become their
      tool, came to me, and besought me to enter parliament. I told them I was
      poor&mdash;was lately married&mdash;that my public ambition must not be
      encouraged at the expense of my private fortunes. They answered, that they
      pledged themselves those fortunes should be their care. I yielded; I
      deserted my profession; I obeyed their wishes; I became famous&mdash;and a
      ruined man! They could not dine without me; they could not sup without me;
      they could not get drunk without me; no pleasure was sweet but in my
      company. What mattered it that, while I ministered to their amusement, I
      was necessarily heaping debt upon debt&mdash;accumulating miseries for
      future years&mdash;laying up bankruptcy, and care, and shame, and a broken
      heart, and an early death? But listen, Constance! Are you listening?&mdash;attentively?&mdash;Well!
      note now, I am a just man. I do not blame my noble friends, my gentle
      patrons, for this. No: if I were forgetful of my interests, if I preferred
      their pleasure to my happiness and honour, that was any crime, and I
      deserve the punishment! But, look you,&mdash;time went by, and my
      constitution was broken; debts came upon me; I could not pay; men
      mistrusted my word; my name in the country fell: With my health, my genius
      deserted me; I was no longer useful to my party; I lost my seat in
      parliament; and when I was on a sick-bed&mdash;you remember it, Constancy&mdash;the
      bailiffs came, and tore me away for a paltry debt&mdash;the value of one
      of those suppers the Prince used to beg me to give him. From that time my
      familiars forsook me!&mdash;not a visit, not a kind act, not a service for
      him whose day of work was over! 'Poor Vernon's character was gone!
      Shockingly involved&mdash;could not perform his promises to his creditors&mdash;always
      so extravagant&mdash;quite unprincipled&mdash;must give him up!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "In those sentences lies the secret of their conduct. They did not
      remember that <i>for</i> them, <i>by</i> them, the character was gone, the
      promises broken, the ruin incurred! They thought not how I had served
      them; how my best years had been devoted to advance them&mdash;to ennoble
      their cause in the lying page of History! All this was not thought of: my
      life was reduced to two epochs&mdash;that of use to them&mdash;that not.
      During the first, I was honoured; during the last, I was left to starve&mdash;to
      rot! Who freed me from prison?&mdash;who protects me now? One of my
      'party'&mdash;my 'noble friends'&mdash;my 'honourable, right honourable
      friends'? No! a tradesman whom I once served in my holyday, and who alone,
      of all the world, forgets me not in my penance. You see gratitude,
      friendship, spring up only in middle life; they grow not in high stations!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, come nearer, for my voice falters, and I would have these words
      distinctly heard. Child, girl as you are&mdash;you I consider pledged to
      record, to fulfil my desire&mdash;my curse! Lay your hand on mine: swear
      that through life to death,&mdash;swear! You speak not! repeat my words
      after me:"&mdash;Constance obeyed:&mdash;"through life to death; through
      good, through ill, through weakness, through power, you will devote
      yourself to humble, to abase that party from whom your father received
      ingratitude, mortification, and death! Swear that you will not marry a
      poor and powerless man, who cannot minister to the ends of that solemn
      retribution I invoke! Swear that you will seek to marry from amongst the
      great; not through love, not through ambition, but through hate, and for
      revenge! You will seek to rise that you may humble those who have betrayed
      me! In the social walks of life you will delight to gall their vanities in
      state intrigues, you will embrace every measure that can bring them to
      their eternal downfall. For this great end you will pursue all means.
      What! you hesitate? Repeat, repeat, repeat!&mdash;You will lie, cringe,
      fawn, and think vice not vice, if it bring you one jot nearer to Revenge!
      With this curse on my foes, I entwine my blessing, dear, dear Constance,
      on you,&mdash;you, who have nursed, watched, all but saved me! God, God
      bless you, my child!" And Vernon burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two hours after this singular scene, and exactly in the third hour
      of morning, that Vernon woke from a short and troubled sleep. The grey
      dawn (for the time was the height of summer) already began to labour
      through the shades and against the stars of night. A raw and comfortless
      chill crept over the earth, and saddened the air in the death-chamber.
      Constance sat by her father's bed, her eyes fixed upon him, and her cheek
      more wan than ever by the pale light of that crude and cheerless dawn.
      When Vernon woke, his eyes, glazed with death, rolled faintly towards her,
      fixing and dimming in their sockets as they gazed;&mdash;his throat
      rattled. But for one moment his voice found vent; a ray shot across his
      countenance as he uttered his last words&mdash;words that sank at once and
      eternally to the core of his daughter's heart&mdash;words that ruled her
      life, and sealed her destiny: "Constance, remember&mdash;the Oath&mdash;Revenge!"

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      REMARK ON THE TENURE OF LIFE.&mdash;THE COFFINS OF GREAT MEN SELDOM
      NEGLECTED.&mdash;CONSTANCE TAKES REFUGE WITH LADY ERPINGHAM.&mdash;THE
      HEROINE'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND CHARACTER.-THE MANOEUVRING TEMPERAMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a strange life this is! what puppets we are! How terrible an enigma
      is Fate! I never set my foot without my door, but what the fearful
      darkness that broods over the next moment rushes upon me. How awful an
      event may hang over our hearts! The sword is always above us, seen or
      invisible!
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this life&mdash;this scene of darkness and dreadsome men would
      have us so contented as to desire, to ask for no other!
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was now without a near relation in the world. But her father
      predicted rightly: vanity supplied the place of affection. Vernon, who for
      eighteen months preceding his death had struggled with the sharpest
      afflictions of want&mdash;Vernon, deserted in life by all, was interred
      with the insulting ceremonials of pomp and state. Six nobles bore his
      pall: long trains of carriages attended his funeral: the journals were
      filled with outlines of his biography and lamentations at his decease.
      They buried him in Westminster Abbey, and they made subscriptions for a
      monument in the very best sort of marble. Lady Erpingham, a distant
      connection of the deceased, invited Constance to live with her; and
      Constance of course consented, for she had no alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day that she arrived at Lady Erpingham's house, in Hill Street,
      there were several persons present in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear, poor girl," said Lady Erpingham,&mdash;for they were talking of
      Constance's expected arrival,&mdash;"I fear that she will be quite abashed
      by seeing so many of us, and under such unhappy circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old is she?" asked a beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About thirteen, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Handsome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not seen her since she was seven years old. She promised then to
      be very beautiful: but she was a remarkably shy, silent child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Vernon," said the groom of the chambers, throwing open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the slow step and self-possessed air of womanhood, but with a far
      haughtier and far colder mien than women commonly assume, Constance Vernon
      walked through the long apartment, and greeted her future guardian. Though
      every eye was on her, she did not blush; though the Queens of the London
      World were round her, her gait and air were more royal than all. Every one
      present experienced a revulsion of feeling. They were prepared for pity;
      this was no case in which pity could be given. Even the words of
      protection died on Lady Erpingham's lip, and she it was who felt bashful
      and disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intend to pass rapidly over the years that elapsed till Constance became
      a woman. Let us glance at her education. Vernon had not only had her
      instructed in the French and Italian; but, a deep and impassioned scholar
      himself, he had taught her the elements of the two great languages of the
      ancient world. The treasures of those languages she afterwards conquered
      of her own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Erpingham had one daughter, who married when Constance had reached
      the age of sixteen. The advantages Lady Eleanor Erpingham possessed in her
      masters and her governess Constance shared. Miss Vernon drew well, and
      sang divinely; but she made no very great proficiency in the science of
      music. To say truth, her mind was somewhat too stern, and somewhat too
      intent on other subjects, to surrender to that most jealous of
      accomplishments the exclusive devotion it requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all her attractions, and of all the evidences of her cultivated
      mind, none equalled the extraordinary grace of her conversation. Wholly
      disregarding the conventional leading-strings in which the minds of young
      ladies are accustomed to be held&mdash;leading-strings, disguised by the
      name of "proper diffidence" and "becoming modesty,"&mdash;she never
      scrupled to share, nay, to lead, discussions even of a grave and solid
      nature. Still less did she scruple to adorn the common trifles that make
      the sum of conversation with the fascinations of a wit, which, playful,
      yet deep, rivalled even the paternal source from which it was inherited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems sometimes odd enough to me, that while young ladies are so
      sedulously taught the accomplishments that a husband disregards, they are
      never taught the great one he would prize. They are taught to be <i>exhibitors</i>;
      he wants a <i>companion</i>. He wants neither a singing animal, nor a
      drawing animal, nor a dancing animal: he wants a talking animal. But to
      talk they are never taught; all they know of conversation is slander, and
      that "comes by nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Constance <i>did</i> talk <i>beautifully</i>; not like a pedant, or a
      blue, or a Frenchwoman. A child would have been as much charmed with her
      as a scholar; but <i>both</i> would have been charmed. Her father's
      eloquence had descended to her; but in him eloquence commanded, in her it
      won. There was another trait she possessed in common with her father:
      Vernon (as most disappointed men are wont) had done the world injustice by
      his accusations. It was not his poverty and his distresses alone which had
      induced his party to look coolly on his declining day. They were not
      without some apparent excuse for desertion&mdash;they doubted his <i>sincerity</i>.
      It is true that it was without actual cause. No modern politician had ever
      been more consistent. He had refused bribes, though poor; and place,
      though ambitious. But he was essentially&mdash;here is the secret&mdash;essentially
      an intriguant. Bred in the old school of policy, he thought that
      manoeuvring was wisdom, and duplicity the art of governing. Like
      Lysander,(1) he loved plotting, yet neglected self-interest. There was not
      a man less open, or more honest. This character, so rare in all countries,
      is especially so in England. Your blunt squires, your politicians at
      Bellamy's, do not comprehend it. They saw in Vernon the arts which deceive
      enemies, and they dreaded lest, though his friends, they themselves should
      be deceived. This disposition, so fatal to Vernon, his daughter inherited.
      With a dark, bold, and passionate genius, which in a man would have led to
      the highest enterprises, she linked the feminine love of secrecy and
      scheming. To borrow again from Plutarch and Lysander, "When the skin of
      the lion fell short, she was quite of opinion that it should be eked out
      with the fox's."

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE HERO INTRODUCED TO OUR READER'S NOTICE.&mdash;DIALOGUE BETWEEN HIMSELF
      AND HIS FATHER.&mdash;PERCY GODOLPHIN's CHARACTER AS A BOY.&mdash;THE
      CATASTROPHE OF HIS SCHOOL LIFE.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Percy, remember that it is to-morrow you will return to school," said Mr.
      Godolphin to his only son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy pouted, and after a momentary silence replied, "No, father, I think
      I shall go to Mr. Saville's. He has asked me to spend a month with him;
      and he says rightly that I shall learn more with him than at Dr.
      Shallowell's, where I am already head of the sixth form."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Saville is a coxcomb, and you are another!" replied the father, who,
      dressed in an old flannel dressing-gown, with a worn velvet cap on his
      head, and cowering gloomily over a wretched fire, seemed no bad
      personification of that mixture of half-hypochondriac, half-miser, which
      he was in reality. "Don't talk to me of going to town, sir, or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," interrupted Percy, in a cool and nonchalant tone, as he folded
      his arms, and looked straight and shrewdly on the paternal face&mdash;"father,
      let us understand each other. My schooling, I suppose, is rather an
      expensive affair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may well say that, sir! Expensive!&mdash;It is frightful, horrible,
      ruinous!&mdash;Expensive! Twenty pounds a year board and Latin; five
      guineas washing; five more for writing and arithmetic. Sir, if I were not
      resolved that you should not want education, though you may want fortune,
      I should&mdash;yes, I should&mdash;what do you mean, sir?&mdash;you are
      laughing! Is this your respect, your gratitude to your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight shade fell over the bright and intelligent countenance of the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let us talk of gratitude," said he sadly; "Heaven knows what either
      you or I have to be grateful for! Fortune has left to your proud name but
      these bare walls and a handful of barren acres; to me she gave a father's
      affection&mdash;not such as Nature had made it, but cramped and soured by
      misfortunes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Percy paused, and his father seemed also struck and affected. "Let
      us," renewed in a lighter strain this singular boy, who might have passed,
      by some months, his sixteenth year,&mdash;"let us see if we cannot
      accommodate matters to our mutual satisfaction. You can ill afford my
      schooling, and I am resolved that at school I will not stay. Saville is a
      relation of ours; he has taken a fancy to me; he has even hinted that he
      may leave me his fortune; and he has promised, at least, to afford me a
      home and his tuition as long as I like. Give me free passport hereafter to
      come and go as I list, and I in turn, will engage never to cost you
      another shilling. Come, sir, shall it be a compact?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wound me, Percy," said the father, with a mournful pride in his tone;
      "I have not deserved this, at least from you. You know not, boy&mdash;you
      know not all that has hardened this heart; but to you it has not been
      hard, and a taunt from you&mdash;yes, that is the serpent's tooth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy in an instant was at his father's feet; he seized both his hands,
      and burst into a passionate fit of tears. "Forgive me," he said, in broken
      words; "I&mdash;I meant not to taunt you. I am but a giddy boy!&mdash;send
      me to school!&mdash;do with me as you will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said the old man, shaking his head gently, "you know not what pain a
      son's bitter word can send to a parent's heart. But it is all natural,
      perfectly natural! You would reproach me with a love of money, it is the
      sin to which youth is the least lenient. But what! can I look round the
      world and not see its value, its necessity? Year after year, from my first
      manhood, I have toiled and toiled to preserve from the hammer these last
      remnants of my ancestor's remains. Year after year fortune has slipped
      from my grasp; and, after all my efforts, and towards the close of a long
      life, I stand on the very verge of penury. But you cannot tell&mdash;no
      man whose heart is not seared with many years can tell or can appreciate,
      the motives that have formed my character. You, however,"&mdash;and his
      voice softened as he laid his hand on his son's head, "you, however,&mdash;the
      gay, the bold, the young,&mdash;should not have your brow crossed and your
      eye dimmed by the cares that surround me. Go! I will accompany you to
      town; I will see Saville myself. If he be one with whom my son can, at so
      tender an age, be safely trusted, you shall pay him the visit you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy would have replied but his father checked him; and before the end of
      the evening, the father had resolved to forget as much as he pleased of
      the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Godolphin was one of those characters on whom it is vain to
      attempt making a permanent impression. The habits of his mind were durably
      formed: like waters, they yielded to any sudden intrusion, but closed
      instantly again. Early in life he had been taught that he ought to marry
      an heiress for the benefit of his estate&mdash;his ancestral estate; the
      restoration of which he had been bred to consider the grand object and
      ambition of life. His views had been strangely baffled; but the more they
      were thwarted the more pertinaciously he clung to them. Naturally kind,
      generous, and social, he had sunk, at length, into the anchorite and the
      miser. All other speculations that should retrieve his ancestral honours
      had failed: but there is one speculation that never fails&mdash;the
      speculation of <i>saving!</i> It was to this that he now indissolubly
      attached himself. At moments he was open to all his old habits; but such
      moments were rare and few. A cold, hard, frosty penuriousness was his
      prevalent characteristic. He had sent this son, with eighteen pence in his
      pocket, to a school of twenty pounds a-year; where, naturally enough, he
      learned nothing but mischief and cricket: yet he conceived that his son
      owed him eternal obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily for Percy, he was an especial favourite with a certain not
      uncelebrated character of the name of Saville; and Saville claimed the
      privilege of a relation to supply him with money and receive him at his
      home. Wild, passionate, fond to excess of pleasure, the young Godolphin
      caught eagerly at these occasional visits; and at each his mind, keen and
      penetrating as it naturally was, took new flights, and revelled in new
      views. He was already the leader of his school, the torment of the master,
      and the lover of the master's daughter. He was sixteen years old, but a
      character. A secret pride, a secret bitterness, and an open wit and
      recklessness of bearing, rendered him to all seeming a boy more endowed
      with energies than affections. Yet a kind word from a friend's lips was
      never without its effect on him, and he might have been led by the silk
      while he would have snapped the chain. But these were his boyish traits of
      mind: the world soon altered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of the visit to Saville was not again touched upon. A little
      reflection showed Mr. Godolphin how nugatory were the promises of a
      schoolboy that he should not cost his father another shilling; and he knew
      that Saville's house was not exactly the spot in which economy was best
      learned. He thought it, therefore, more prudent that his son should return
      to school.
    </p>
    <p>
      To school went Percy Godolphin; and about three weeks afterwards, Percy
      Godolphin was condemned to expulsion for returning, with considerable
      unction, a slap in the face that he had received from Dr. Shallowell.
      Instead of waiting for his father's arrival, Percy made up a small bundle
      of clothes, let himself drop, by the help of the bed-curtains, from the
      window of the room in which he was confined, and towards the close of a
      fine summer's evening, found himself on the highroad between and London,
      with independence at his heart and (Saville's last gift) ten guineas in
      his pocket.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PERCY'S FIRST ADVENTURE AS A FREE AGENT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a fine, picturesque outline of road on which the young outcast
      found himself journeying, whither he neither knew nor cared. His heart was
      full of enterprise and the unfledged valour of inexperience. He had
      proceeded several miles, and the dusk of the evening was setting in, when
      he observed a stage-coach crawling heavily up a hill, a little ahead of
      him, and a tall, well-shaped man, walking alongside of it, and
      gesticulating somewhat violently. Godolphin remarked him with some
      curiosity; and the man, turning abruptly round, perceived, and in his turn
      noticed very inquisitively, the person and aspect of the young traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how now?" said he, presently, and in an agreeable, though familiar
      and unceremonious tone of voice; "whither are you bound this time of day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no business of yours, friend," said the boy with the proud
      petulance of his age; "mind what belongs to yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sharp on me, young sir," returned the other; "but it is our
      business to be loquacious. Know, sir,"&mdash;and the stranger frowned&mdash;"that
      we have ordered many a taller fellow than yourself to execution for a much
      smaller insolence than you seem capable of."
    </p>
    <p>
      A laugh from the coach caused Godolphin to lift up his eyes, and he saw
      the door of the vehicle half-open, as if for coolness, and an arch female
      face looking down on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are merry on me, I see," said Percy; "come out, and I'll be even with
      you, pretty one."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady laughed yet more loudly at the premature gallantry of the
      traveller; but the man, without heeding her, and laying his hand on
      Percy's shoulder, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, sir, do you live at B&mdash;&mdash;?" naming the town they were now
      approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I," said Godolphin, freeing himself from the intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will, perhaps, sleep there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too young to travel alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are too old to make such impertinent remarks," retorted
      Godolphin, reddening with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, I like this spirit, my Hotspur," said the stranger, coolly. "If
      you are really going to put up for the night at B&mdash;&mdash;, suppose
      we sup together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who and what are you?" asked Percy, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything and everything! in other words, an actor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the young lady&mdash;&mdash;?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is our prima donna. In fact, except the driver, the coach holds none but
      the ladies and gentlemen of our company. We have made an excellent harvest
      at A&mdash;&mdash;, and we are now on our way to the theatre at B&mdash;&mdash;;
      pretty theatre it is, too, and has been known to hold seventy-one pounds
      eight shillings." Here the actor fell into a reverie; and Percy, moving
      nearer to the coach-door, glanced at the damsel, who returned the look
      with a laugh which, though coquettish, was too low and musical to be
      called cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that gentleman, so free and easy in his manners, is not your husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid! Do you think I should be so gay if he were? But, pooh!
      what can you know of married life? No!" she continued, with a pretty air
      of mock dignity; "I am the Belvidera, the Calista, of the company; above
      all control, all husbanding, and reaping thirty-three shillings a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you above lovers as well as husbands?" asked Percy with a rakish
      air, borrowed from Saville.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless the boy! No: but then my lovers must be at least as tall, and at
      least as rich, and, I am afraid, at least as old, as myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't frighten yourself, my dear," returned Percy; "I was not about to
      make love to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you not? Yes, you were, and you know it. But why will you not sup
      with us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, indeed?" thought Percy, as the idea, thus more enticingly put
      than it was at first, pressed upon him. "If <i>you</i> ask me," he said,
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>do</i> ask you, then," said the actress; and here the hero of the
      company turned abruptly round with a theatrical start, and exclaimed, "To
      sup or not to sup? that is the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To sup, sir," said Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! I am glad to hear it. Had you not better mount and rest
      yourself in the coach? You can take my place&mdash;I am studying a new
      part. We have two miles farther to B&mdash;&mdash; yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy accepted the invitation, and was soon by the side of the pretty
      actress. The horses broke into a slow trot, and thus delighted with his
      adventure, the son of the ascetic Godolphin, the pupil of the courtly
      Saville, entered the town of B&mdash;&mdash;, and commenced his first
      independent campaign in the great world.

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE MUMMERS.&mdash;GODOLPHIN IN LOVE.&mdash;THE EFFECT OF FANNY
      MILLINGER'S ACTING UPON HIM.&mdash;THE TWO OFFERS.&mdash;GODOLPHIN QUITS
      THE PLAYERS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our travellers stopped at the first inn in the outskirts of the town. Here
      they were shown into a large room on the ground-floor, sanded, with a long
      table in the centre; and, before the supper was served, Percy had leisure
      to examine all the companions with whom he had associated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, there was an old gentleman, of the age of sixty-three,
      in a bob-wig, and inclined to be stout, who always played the <i>lover</i>.
      He was equally excellent in the pensive Romeo and the bustling Rapid. He
      had an ill way of talking off the stage, partly because he had lost all
      his front teeth: a circumstance which made him avoid, in general, those
      parts in which he had to force a great deal of laughter. Next, there was a
      little girl, of about fourteen, who played angels, fairies, and, at a
      pinch, was very effective as an old woman. Thirdly, there was our
      free-and-easy cavalier, who, having a loud voice and a manly presence,
      usually performed the tyrant. He was great in Macbeth, greater in
      Bombastes Furioso. Fourthly, came this gentleman's wife, a pretty,
      slatternish woman, much painted. She usually performed the second female&mdash;the
      confidante, the chambermaid&mdash;the Emilia to the Desdemona. And
      fifthly, was Percy's new inamorata,&mdash;a girl of about one-and-twenty,
      fair, with a nez retrousse: beautiful auburn hair, that was always a
      little dishevelled; the prettiest mouth, teeth, and dimple imaginable; a
      natural colour; and a person that promised to incline hereafter towards
      that roundness of proportion which is more dear to the sensual than the
      romantic. This girl, whose name was Fanny Millinger, was of so frank,
      good-humoured, and lively a turn, that she was the idol of the whole
      company, and her superiority in acting was never made a matter of
      jealousy. Actors may believe this, or not, as they please.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is this all your company?" said Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All? no!" replied Fanny, taking off her bonnet, and curling up her
      tresses by the help of a dim glass. "The rest are provided at the theatre
      along with the candle-snuffer and scene-shifters part of the fixed
      property. Why won't <i>you</i> take to the stage? I wish you would! you
      would make a very respectable&mdash;page."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word!" said Percy, exceedingly offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come!" cried the actress, clapping her hands, and perfectly
      unheeding his displeasure&mdash;"why don't you help me off with my cloak?&mdash;why
      don't you set me a chair?&mdash;why don't you take this great box out of
      my way?&mdash;why don't you&mdash;&mdash;Heaven help me!" and she stamped
      her little foot quite seriously on the floor. "A pretty person for a lover
      you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oho! then I am a lover, you acknowledge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!&mdash;get a chair next me at supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Godolphin was perfectly fascinated by the lively actress; and it
      was with no small interest that he stationed himself the following night
      in the stage-box of the little theatre at &mdash;&mdash;, to see how his
      Fanny acted. The house was tolerably well filled, and the play was <i>She
      Stoops to Conquer</i>. The male parts were, on the whole, respectably
      managed; though Percy was somewhat surprised to observe that a man, who
      had joined the corps that morning, blessed with the most solemn
      countenance in the world&mdash;a fine Roman nose, and a forehead like a
      sage's&mdash;was now dressed in nankeen tights, and a coat without skirts,
      splitting the sides of the gallery in the part of Tony Lumpkin. But into
      the heroine, Fanny Millinger threw a grace, a sweetness, a simple, yet
      dignified spirit of trite love that at once charmed and astonished all
      present. The applause was unbounded; and Percy Godolphin felt proud of
      himself for having admired one whom every one else seemed also resolved
      upon admiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the comedy was finished, he went behind the scenes, and for the first
      time felt the rank which intellect bestows. This idle girl, with whom he
      had before been so familiar; who had seemed to him, boy as he was, only
      made for jesting and coquetry, and trifling, he now felt to be raised to a
      sudden eminence that startled and abashed him. He became shy and awkward,
      and stood at a distance stealing a glance towards her, but without the
      courage to approach and compliment her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick eye of the actress detected the effect she had produced. She was
      naturally pleased at it, and coming up to Godolphin, she touched his
      shoulder, and with a smile rendered still more brilliant by the rouge yet
      unwashed from the dimpled cheeks, said&mdash;"Well, most awkward swain? no
      flattery ready for me? Go to! you won't suit me: get yourself another
      empress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have pleased me into respecting you," said Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a delicacy in the expression that was very characteristic of the
      real mind of the speaker, though that mind was not yet developed; and the
      pretty actress was touched by it at the moment, though, despite the grace
      of her acting, she was by nature far too volatile to think it at all
      advantageous to be <i>respected</i> in the long run. She did not act in
      the afterpiece, and Godolphin escorted her home to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as his ten guineas lasted&mdash;which the reader will conceive was
      not very long&mdash;Godolphin stayed with the gay troop, as the welcome
      lover of its chief ornament. To her he confided his name and history: she
      laughed heartily at the latter&mdash;for she was one of Venus's true
      children, fond of striking mirth out of all subjects. "But what," said
      she, patting his cheek affectionately, "what should hinder you from
      joining us for a little while? I could teach you to be an actor in three
      lessons. Come now, attend! It is but a mere series of tricks, this art
      that seems to you so admirable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin grew embarrassed. There was in him a sort of hidden pride that
      could never endure to subject itself to the censure of others. He had no
      propensity to imitation, and he had a strong susceptibility to the
      ridiculous. These traits of mind thus early developed&mdash;which in later
      life prevented his ever finding fit scope for his natural powers, which
      made him too proud to bustle, and too philosophical to shine&mdash;were of
      service to him on this occasion, and preserved him from the danger into
      which he might otherwise have fallen. He could not be persuaded to act:
      the fair Fanny gave up the attempt in despair. "Yet stay with us," said
      she, tenderly, "and share my poor earnings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin started; and in the wonderful contradictions of the proud human
      heart, this generous offer from the poor actress gave him a distaste, a
      displeasure, that almost reconciled him to parting from her. It seemed to
      open to him at once the equivocal mode of life he had entered upon. "No,
      Fanny," said he, after a pause, "I am here because I resolved to be
      independent: I cannot, therefore, choose dependence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Millinger is wanted instantly for rehearsal," said the little girl
      who acted fairies and old women, putting her head suddenly into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me!" cried Fanny, starting up; "is it so late? Well, I must go now.
      Good-bye! look in upon us&mdash;do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Godolphin, moody and thoughtful, walked into the street; and lo! the
      first thing that greeted his eyes was a handbill on the wall, describing
      his own person, and offering twenty guineas reward for his detention. "Let
      him return to his afflicted parent," was the conclusion of the bill, "and
      all shall be forgiven."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin crept back to his apartment; wrote a long, affectionate letter
      to Fanny; inclosed her his watch, as the only keepsake in his power; gave
      her his address at Saville's; and then, towards dusk, once more sallied
      forth, and took a place in the mail for London. He had no money for his
      passage, but his appearance was such that the coachman readily trusted
      him; and the next morning at daybreak he was under Saville's roof.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      PERCY GODOLPHIN THE GUEST OF SAVILLE.&mdash;HE ENTERS THE LIFE-GUARDS AND
      BECOMES THE FASHION.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so," said Saville, laughing, "you really gave them the slip:
      excellent! But I envy you your adventures with the player folk. 'Gad! if I
      were some years younger, I would join them myself; I should act Sir
      Pertinax Macsycophant famously; I have a touch of the mime in me. Well!
      but what do you propose to do?&mdash;live with me?&mdash;eh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I think that might be the best, and certainly it would be the
      pleasantest mode of passing my life. But&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I can scarcely quarter myself on your courtesy; I should soon grow
      discontented. So I shall write to my father, whom I, kindly and
      considerately, by the way, informed of my safety the very first day of my
      arrival at B&mdash;&mdash;. I told him to direct his letters to your
      house; but I regret to find that the handbill which so frightened me from
      my propriety is the only notice he has deigned to take of my whereabout. I
      shall write to him therefore again, begging him to let me enter the army.
      It is not a profession I much fancy; but what then! I shall be my own
      master."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well said!" answered Saville; "and here I hope I can serve you. If
      your father will pay the lawful sum for a commission in the Guards, why, I
      think I have interest to get you in for that sum alone&mdash;no trifling
      favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin was enchanted at this proposal, and instantly wrote to his
      father, urging it strongly upon him; Saville, in a separate epistle,
      seconded the motion. "You see," wrote the latter, "you see, my dear sir,
      that your son is a wild, resolute scapegrace. You can do nothing with him
      by schools and coercion: put him to discipline in the king's service, and
      condemn him to live on his pay. It is a cheap mode, after all, of
      providing for a reprobate; and as he will have the good fortune to enter
      the army at so early an age, by the time he is thirty, he may be a colonel
      on full pay. Seriously, this is the best thing you can do with him,&mdash;unless
      you have a living in your family."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman was much discomposed by these letters, and by his son's
      previous elopement. He could not, however, but foresee, that if he
      resisted the boy's wishes, he was likely to have a troublesome time of it.
      Scrape after scrape, difficulty following difficulty, might ensue, all
      costing both anxiety and money. The present offer furnished him with a
      fair excuse for ridding himself, for a long time to come, of further
      provision for his offspring; and now growing daily more and more attached
      to the indolent routine of solitary economies in which he moved, he was
      glad of an opportunity to deliver himself from future interruption, and
      surrender his whole soul to his favourite occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after a fortnight's delay and meditation, he wrote shortly to
      Saville and his son; saying, after much reproach to the latter, that if
      the commission could really be purchased at the sum specified he was
      willing to make a sacrifice, for which he must pinch himself, and conclude
      the business. This touched the son, but Saville laughed him out of the
      twinge of good feeling; and very shortly afterwards, Percy Godolphin was
      gazetted as a cornet in the &mdash;&mdash; Life-Guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of a soldier, in peace, is indolent enough, Heaven knows! Percy
      liked the new uniforms and the new horses&mdash;all of which were bought
      on credit. He liked his new companions; he liked balls; he liked flirting;
      he did not dislike Hyde Park from four o'clock till six; and he was not
      very much bored by drills and parade. It was much to his credit in the
      world that he was the protege of a man who had so great a character for
      profligacy and gambling as Augustus Saville; and under such auspices he
      found himself launched at once into the full tide of "good society."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young, romantic, high-spirited&mdash;with the classic features of an
      Antinous, and a very pretty knack of complimenting and writing verses&mdash;Percy
      Godolphin soon became, while yet more fit in years for the nursery than
      the world, "the curled darling" of that wide class of high-born women who
      have nothing to do but to hear love made to them, and who, all artifice
      themselves, think the love sweetest which springs from the most natural
      source. They like boyhood when it is not bashful; and from sixteen to
      twenty, a Juan need scarcely go to Seville to find a Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      But love was not the worst danger that menaced the intoxicated boy.
      Saville, the most seductive of tutors&mdash;Saville who, in his wit; his
      bon ton, his control over the great world, seemed as a god to all less
      elevated and less aspiring,&mdash;Saville was Godolphin's constant
      companion; and Saville was worse than a profligate&mdash;he was a gambler!
      One would think that gaming was the last vice that could fascinate the
      young: its avarice, its grasping, its hideous selfishness, its cold,
      calculating meanness, would, one might imagine, scare away all who have
      yet other and softer deities to worship. But, in fact, the fault of youth
      is that it can rarely resist whatever is the Mode. Gaming, in all
      countries, is the vice of an aristocracy. The young find it already
      established in the best circles; they are enticed by the habit of others,
      and ruined when the habit becomes their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look feverish, Percy," said Saville, as he met his pupil in the Park.
      "I don't wonder at it; you lost infernally last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than I can pay," replied Percy, with a quivering lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! you shall pay it to-morrow, for you shall go shares with me to-night.
      Observe," continued Saville, lowering his voice, "<i>I never lose</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How <i>never?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, unless by design. I play at no game where chance only presides.
      Whist is my favourite game: it is not popular: I am sorry for it. I take
      up with other games,&mdash;I am forced to do it; but, even at rouge et
      noir, I carry about with me the rules of whist. I calculate&mdash;I
      remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But hazard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never play at that," said Saville, solemnly. "It is the devil's game;
      it defies skill. Forsake hazard, and let me teach you ecarte; it is coming
      into fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saville took great pains with Godolphin; and Godolphin, who was by nature
      of a contemplative, not hasty mood, was no superficial disciple. As his
      biographer, I grieve to confess, that he became, though a punctiliously
      honest, a wise and fortunate gamester; and thus he eked out betimes the
      slender profits of a subaltern's pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first great deterioration in Percy's mind&mdash;a mind which
      ought to have made him a very different being from what he became, but
      which no vice, no evil example, could ever entirely pervert.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SAVILLE EXCUSED FOR HAVING HUMAN AFFECTIONS.&mdash;GODOLPHIN SEES ONE WHOM
      HE NEVER SEES AGAIN.&mdash;THE NEW ACTRESS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saville was deemed the consummate man of the world&mdash;wise and
      heartless. How came he to take such gratuitous pains with the boy
      Godolphin? In the first place, Saville had no legitimate children;
      Godolphin was his relation; in the second place it may be observed that
      hackneyed and sated men of the world are fond of the young, in whom they
      recognise something&mdash;a better something belonging to themselves. In
      Godolphin's gentleness and courage, Saville thought he saw the mirror of
      his own crusted urbanity and scheming perseverance; in Godolphin's fine
      imagination and subtle intellect he beheld his own cunning and hypocrisy.
      The boy's popularity flattered him; the boy's conversation amused. No man
      is so heartless but that he is capable of strong likings, when they do not
      put him much out of his way; it was this sort of liking that Saville had
      for Godolphin. Besides, there was yet another reason for attachment, which
      might at first seem too delicate to actuate the refined voluptuary; but
      examined closely, the delicacy vanished. Saville had loved, at least had
      offered his hand to&mdash;Godolphin's mother (she was supposed an
      heiress!) He thought he had just missed being Godolphin's father: his
      vanity made him like to show the boy what a much better father he would
      have been than the one that Providence had given him. His resentment, too,
      against the accepted suitor, made him love to exercise a little spiteful
      revenge against Godolphin's father; he was glad to show that the son
      preferred where the mother rejected. All these motives combined made
      Saville take, as it were, to the young Percy; and being rich, and
      habitually profuse, though prudent, and a shrewd speculator withal, the
      pecuniary part of his kindness cost him no pain. But Godolphin, who was
      not ostentatious, did not trust himself largely to the capricious fount of
      the worldling's generosity. Fortune smiled on her boyish votary; and
      during the short time he was obliged to cultivate her favours, showered on
      him at least a sufficiency for support, or even for display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crowded with fine people, and blazing with light, were the rooms of the
      Countess of B&mdash;&mdash;, as, flushed from a late dinner at Saville's,
      young Godolphin made his appearance in the scene. He was not of those
      numerous gentlemen, the stock-flowers of the parterre, who stick
      themselves up against walls in the panoply of neckclothed silence. He came
      not to balls from the vulgar motive of being seen there in the most
      conspicuous situation&mdash;a motive so apparent among the stiff
      exquisites of England. He came to amuse himself; and if he found no one
      capable of amusing him, he saw no necessity in staying. He was always
      seen, therefore, conversing or dancing, or listening to music&mdash;or he
      was not seen at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In exchanging a few words with a Colonel D&mdash;&mdash;, a noted roue and
      gamester, he observed, gazing on him very intently&mdash;and as Percy
      thought, very rudely&mdash;an old gentleman in a dress of the last
      century. Turn where he would, Godolphin could not rid himself of the gaze;
      so at length he met it with a look of equal scrutiny and courage. The old
      gentleman slowly approached. "Percy Godolphin, I think?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is <i>my</i> name, sir," replied Percy. "Yours&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter! Yet stay! you shall know it. I am Henry Johnstone&mdash;old
      Harry Johnstone. You have heard of him?&mdash;your father's first cousin.
      Well, I grieve, young sir, to find that you associate with that rascal
      Saville&mdash;Nay, never interrupt me sir!&mdash;I grieve to find that
      you, thus young, thus unguarded, are left to be ruined in heart and
      corrupted in nature by any one who will take the trouble! Yet I like your
      countenance!&mdash;I like your countenance!&mdash;it is open, yet
      thoughtful; frank, and yet it has something of melancholy. You have not
      Charles's coloured hair; but you are much younger&mdash;much. I am glad I
      have seen you; I came here on purpose; good-night!"&mdash;and without
      waiting for an answer, the old man disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, recovering from his surprise, recollected that he had often
      heard his father speak of a rich and eccentric relation named Johnstone.
      This singular interview made a strong but momentary impression on him. He
      intended to seek out the old man's residence; but one thing or another
      drove away the fulfilment of the intention, and in this world the
      relations never met again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy, now musingly gliding through the crowd, sank into a seat beside a
      lady of forty-five, who sometimes amused herself in making love to him&mdash;because
      there could be no harm in such a mere boy!&mdash;and presently afterwards,
      a Lord George Somebody, sauntering up, asked the lady if he had not seen
      her at the play on the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes! we went to see the new actress. How pretty she is!&mdash;so
      unaffected too;&mdash;how well she sings!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty well&mdash;er!" replied Lord George, passing his hand through his
      hair. "Very nice girl&mdash;er!&mdash;good ankles. Devilish hot&mdash;er,
      is it not&mdash;er&mdash;er? What a bore this is: eh! Ah! Godolphin! don't
      forget Wattier's&mdash;er!" and his lordship er'd himself off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What actress is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a very good one indeed!&mdash;came out in <i>The Belle's Stratagem</i>.
      We are going to see her to-morrow; will you dine with us early, and be our
      cavalier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing will please me more! Your ladyship has dropped your
      handkerchief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you!" said the lady, bending till her hair touched Godolphin's
      cheek, and gently pressing the hand that was extended to her. It was a
      wonder that Godolphin never became a coxcomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dined at Wattier's the next day according to appointment: he went to
      the play; and at the moment his eye first turned to the stage, a universal
      burst of applause indicated the entrance of the new actress&mdash;Fanny
      Millinger!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      GODOLPHIN'S PASSION FOR THE STAGE.&mdash;THE DIFFERENCE IT ENGENDERED IN
      HIS HABITS OF LIFE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this event produced a great influence over Godolphin's habits&mdash;and
      I suppose, therefore, I may add, over his character. He renewed his
      acquaintance with the lively actress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a change!" cried both.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The strolling player risen into celebrity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the runaway boy polished into fashion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are handsomer than ever, Fanny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I return the compliment," replied Fanny; with a curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Godolphin became a constant attendant at the theatre. This led him
      into a mode of life quite different from that which he had lately
      cultivated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are in London two sets of idle men: one set, the butterflies of
      balls; the loungers of the regular walks of society; diners out; the "old
      familiar faces," seen everywhere, known to every one: the other set, a
      more wild, irregular, careless race; who go little into parties, and vote
      balls a nuisance; who live in clubs; frequent theatres; drive about late
      o' nights in mysterious-looking vehicles and enjoy a vast acquaintance
      among the Aspasias of pleasure. These are the men who are the critics of
      theatricals: black-neckclothed and well-booted, they sit in their boxes
      and decide on the ankles of a dancer or the voice of a singer. They have a
      smattering of literature, and use a great deal of French in their
      conversation: they have something of romance in their composition, and
      have been known to marry for love. In short, there is in their whole
      nature, a more roving, liberal, Continental character of dissipation, than
      belongs to the cold, tame, dull, prim, hedge-clipped indolence of more
      national exquisitism. Into this set, out of the other set, fell young
      Godolphin; and oh! the merry mornings at actresses' houses; the jovial
      suppers after the play; the buoyancy, the brilliancy, the esprit, with
      which the hours, from midnight to cockcrow, were often pelted with
      rose-leaves and drowned in Rhenish.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees, however, as Godolphin warmed into his attendance at the
      playhouses, the fine intellectual something that lay yet undestroyed at
      his heart stirred up emotions which he felt his more vulgar associates
      were unfitted to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is that in theatrical representation which perpetually awakens
      whatever romance belongs to our character. The magic lights; the pomp of
      scene; the palace, the camp; the forest; the midnight wold; the moonlight
      reflected on the water; the melody of the tragic rhythm; the grace of the
      comic wit; the strange art that give such meaning to the poet's lightest
      word;&mdash;the fair, false, exciting life that is detailed before us&mdash;crowding
      into some three little hours all that our most busy ambition could desire&mdash;love,
      enterprise, war, glory! the kindling exaggeration of the sentiments which
      belong to the stage&mdash;like our own in our boldest moments: all these
      appeals to our finer senses are not made in vain. Our taste for
      castle-building and visions deepens upon us; and we chew a mental opium
      which stagnates all the other faculties, but wakens that of the ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin was peculiarly fascinated by the stage; he loved to steal away
      from his companions, and, alone, and unheeded, to feast his mind on the
      unreal stream of existence that mirrored images so beautiful. And oh!
      while yet we are young&mdash;while yet the dew lingers on the green leaf
      of spring&mdash;while all the brighter, the more enterprising part of the
      future is to come&mdash;while we know not whether the true life may not be
      visionary and excited as the false&mdash;how deep and rich a transport is
      it to see, to feel, to hear Shakspeare's conceptions made actual, though
      all imperfectly, and only for an hour! Sweet Arden! are we in thy forest?&mdash;thy
      "shadowy groves and unfrequented glens"? Rosalind, Jaques, Orlando, have
      you indeed a being upon earth! Ah! this is true enchantment! and when we
      turn back to life, we turn from the colours which the Claude glass
      breathes over a winter's landscape to the nakedness of the landscape
      itself!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE LEGACY.&mdash;A NEW DEFORMITY IN SAVILLE.&mdash;THE NATURE OF WORLDLY
      LIAISONS.&mdash;GODOLPHIN LEAVES ENGLAND.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, it is not always a sustainer of the stage delusion to be
      enamoured of an actress: it takes us too much behind the scenes. Godolphin
      felt this so strongly that he liked those plays least in which Fanny
      performed. Off the stage her character had so little romance, that he
      could not deceive himself into the romance of her character before the
      lamps. Luckily, however, Fanny did not attempt Shakspeare. She was
      inimitable in vaudeville, in farce, and in the lighter comedy; but she had
      prudently abandoned tragedy in deserting the barn. She was a girl of much
      talent and quickness, and discovered exactly the paths in which her vanity
      could walk without being wounded. And there was a simplicity, a frankness,
      about her manner, that made her a most agreeable companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attachment between her and Godolphin was not very violent; it was a
      silken tie, which opportunity could knit and snap a hundred times over
      without doing much wrong to the hearts it so lightly united. Over
      Godolphin the attachment itself had no influence, while the effects of the
      attachment had an influence so great.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, after an absence from town of two or three days Godolphin
      returned home from the theatre, and found among the letters waiting his
      arrival one from his father. It was edged with black; the seal, too, was
      black. Godolphin's heart misgave him: tremblingly he opened it, and read
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR PERCY,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have news for you, which I do not know whether I should call good or
      bad. On the one hand, your cousin, that old oddity, Harry Johnstone, is
      dead, and has left you, out of his immense fortune, the poor sum of twenty
      thousand pounds. But mark! on condition that you leave the Guards, and
      either reside with me, or at least leave London, till your majority is
      attained. If you refuse these conditions you lose the legacy. It is rather
      strange that this curious character should take such pains with your
      morals, and yet not leave <i>me</i> a single shilling. But justice is out
      of fashion nowadays; your showy virtues only are the rage. I beg, if you
      choose to come down here, that you will get me twelve yards of
      house-flannel; I inclose a pattern of the quality. Snugg, in Oxford
      Street, near Tottenham Court Road, is my man. It is certainly a handsome
      thing in old Johnstone: but so odd to omit me. How did you get acquainted
      with him? The twenty thousand pounds will, however, do much for the poor
      property. Pray take care of it, Percy,&mdash;pray do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had a touch of the gout, for the first time. I have been too
      luxurious: by proper abstinence, I trust to bring it down. Compliments to
      that smooth rogue, Saville.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your affectionate, A. G.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P. S.&mdash;Discharged Old Sally for flirting with the butcher's boy:
      flirtations of that sort make meat weigh much heavier. Bess is my only
      she-helpmate now, besides the old creature who shows the ruins: so much
      the better. What an eccentric creature that Johnstone was! I hate
      eccentric people."
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter fell from Percy's hands. And this, then, was the issue of his
      single interview with the poor old man! It was events like these, wayward
      and strange (events which chequered his whole life), that, secretly to
      himself, tinged Godolphin's character with superstition. He afterwards
      dealt con amore with fatalities and influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may be sure that he did not sleep much that night. Early the next
      morning he sought Saville, and imparted to him the intelligence he had
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Droll enough!" said Saville, languidly, and more than a little displeased
      at this generosity to Godolphin from another; for, like all small-hearted
      persons, he was jealous; "droll enough! Hem! and you never knew him but
      once, and then he abused me! I wonder at that; I was very obliging to his
      vulgar son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! he had a son, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some two-legged creature of that sort, raw and bony, dropped into London,
      like a ptarmigan, wild, and scared out of his wits. Old Johnstone was in
      the country, taking care of his wife, who had lost the use of her limbs
      ever since she had been married;&mdash;caught a violent&mdash;husband&mdash;the
      first day of wedlock! The boy, sole son and heir, came up to town at the
      age of discretion; got introduced to me; I patronised him; brought him
      into a decent degree of fashion; played a few games at cards with him; won
      some money; would not win any more; advised him to leave off; too young to
      play; neglected my advice; went on, and, d&mdash;n the fellow! if he did
      not cut his throat one morning; and the father, to my astonishment, laid
      the blame upon me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin stood appalled in speechless disgust. He never loved Saville
      from that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," resumed Saville, carelessly, "he had lost very considerably.
      His father was a stern, hard man, and the poor boy was frightened at the
      thought of his displeasure. I suppose Monsieur Papa imagined me a sort of
      moral ogre, eating up all the little youths that fall in my way! since he
      leaves you twenty thousand pounds on condition that you take care of
      yourself and shun the castle I live in. Well, well! 'tis all very
      flattering! And where will you go? To Spain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This story affected Percy sensibly. He regretted deeply that he had not
      sought out the bereaved father, and been of some comfort to his later
      hours. He appreciated all that warmth of sympathy, that delicacy of heart,
      which had made the old man compassionate his young relation's unfriended
      lot, and couple his gift with a condition, likely perhaps, to limit
      Percy's desires to the independence thus bestowed, and certain to remove
      his more tender years from a scene of constant contagion. Thus melancholy
      and thoughtful, Godolphin repaired to the house of the now famous, the now
      admired Miss Millinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny received the good news of his fortune with a smile, and the bad news
      of his departure from England with a tear. There are some attachments, of
      which we so easily sound the depth, that the one never thinks of exacting
      from the other the sacrifices that seemed inevitable to more earnest
      affections. Fanny never dreamed of leaving her theatrical career, and
      accompanying Godolphin; Godolphin never dreamed of demanding it. These are
      the connections of the great world: my good reader, learn the great world
      as you look at them!
    </p>
    <p>
      All was soon settled. Godolphin was easily disembarrassed of his
      commission. Six hundred a year from his fortune was allowed him during his
      minority. He insisted on sharing this allowance with his father; the
      moiety left to himself was quite sufficient for all that a man so young
      could require. At the age of little more than seventeen, but with a
      character which premature independence had half formed, and also half
      enervated, the young Godolphin saw the shores of England recede before
      him, and felt himself alone in the universe&mdash;the lord of his own
      fate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE EDUCATION OF CONSTANCE'S MIND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Constance Vernon grew up in womanhood and beauty. All around
      her contributed to feed that stern remembrance which her father's dying
      words had bequeathed. Naturally proud, quick, susceptible, she felt
      slights, often merely incidental, with a deep and brooding resentment. The
      forlorn and dependent girl could not, indeed, fail to meet with many
      bitter proofs that her situation was not forgotten by a world in which
      prosperity and station are the cardinal virtues. Many a loud whisper, many
      an intentional "aside," reached her haughty ear, and coloured her pale
      cheek. Such accidents increased her early-formed asperity of thought;
      chilled the gushing flood of her young affections; and sharpened, with a
      relentless edge, her bitter and caustic hatred to a society she deemed at
      once insolent and worthless. To a taste intuitively fine and noble the
      essential vulgarities&mdash;the fierceness to-day, the cringing to-morrow;
      the veneration for power; the indifference to virtue, which characterised
      the framers and rulers of "society"&mdash;could not but bring contempt as
      well as anger; and amidst the brilliant circles, to which so many aspirers
      looked up with hopeless ambition, Constance moved only to ridicule, to
      loathe, to despise.
    </p>
    <p>
      So strong, so constantly nourished, was this sentiment of contempt, that
      it lasted with equal bitterness when Constance afterwards became the queen
      and presider over that great world in which she now shone&mdash;to dazzle,
      but not to rule. What at first might have seemed an exaggerated and insane
      prayer on the part of her father, grew, as her experience ripened, a
      natural and laudable command. She was thrown entirely with that party
      amongst whom were his early friends and his late deserters. She resolved
      to humble the crested arrogance around her, as much from her own desire,
      as from the wish to obey and avenge her father. From contempt for rank
      rose naturally the ambition of rank. The young beauty resolved, to banish
      love from her heart; to devote herself to one aim and object; to win title
      and station, that she might be able to give power and permanence to her
      disdain of those qualities in others; and in the secrecy of night she
      repeated the vow which had consoled her father's death-bed, and solemnly
      resolved to crush love within her heart and marry solely for station and
      for power.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the daughter of so celebrated a politician, it was natural that
      Constance should take interest in politics. She lent to every discussion
      of state events an eager and thirsty ear. She embraced with masculine
      ardour such sentiments as were then considered the extreme of liberality;
      and she looked on that career which society limits to man, as the noblest,
      the loftiest in the world. She regretted that she was a woman, and
      prevented from personally carrying into effect the sentiments she
      passionately espoused. Meanwhile, she did not neglect, nor suffer to rust,
      the bright weapon of a wit which embodied at times all the biting energies
      of her contempt. To insolence she retorted sarcasm; and, early able to see
      that society, like virtue, must be trampled upon in order to yield forth
      its incense, she rose into respect by the hauteur of her manner, the
      bluntness of her satire, the independence of her mind, far more than by
      her various accomplishments and her unrivalled beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Lady Erpingham she had nothing to complain; kind, easy, and
      characterless, her protectress sometimes wounded her by carelessness, but
      never through design; on the contrary, the Countess at once loved and
      admired her, and was as anxious that her protegee should form a brilliant
      alliance as if she had been her own daughter. Constance, therefore, loved
      Lady Erpingham with sincere and earnest warmth, and endeavoured to forget
      all the commonplaces and littlenesses which made up the mind of her
      protectress, and which, otherwise, would have been precisely of that
      nature to which one like Constance would have been the least indulgent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONVERSATION BETWEEN LADY ERPINGHAM AND CONSTANCE.&mdash;FURTHER
      PARTICULARS OF GODOLPHIN'S FAMILY, ETC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Erpingham was a widow; her jointure, for she had been an heiress and
      a duke's daughter, was large; and the noblest mansion of all the various
      seats possessed by the wealthy and powerful house of Erpingham had been
      allotted by her late lord for her widowed residence. Thither she went
      punctually on the first of every August, and quitted it punctually on the
      eighth of every January.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some years after the date of Godolphin's departure from England,
      and the summer following the spring in which Constance had been "brought
      out;" and, after a debut of such splendour that at this day (many years
      subsequent to that period) the sensation she created is not only a matter
      of remembrance but of conversation, Constance, despite the triumph of her
      vanity, was not displeased to seek some refuge, even from admiration,
      among the shades of Wendover Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When," said she one morning, as she was walking with Lady Erpingham upon
      a terrace beneath the windows of the castle, which overlooked the country
      for miles,&mdash;"when will you go with me, dear Lady Erpingham, to see
      those ruins of which I have heard so much and so often, and which I have
      never been able to persuade you to visit? Look! the day is so clear that
      we can see their outline now&mdash;there, to the right of that church!&mdash;they
      cannot be so very far from Wendover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Godolphin Priory is about twelve miles off," said Lady Erpingham; "but it
      may seem nearer, for it is situated on the highest spot of the county.
      Poor Arthur Godolphin! he is lately dead!" Lady Erpingham sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard you speak of him before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There might be a reason for my silence, Constance. He was the person, of
      all whom I ever saw, who appeared to me when I was at your age, the most
      fascinating. Not, Constance, that I was in love with him, or that he gave
      me any reason to become so through gratitude for any affection on his
      part. It was a girl's fancy, idle and short-lived&mdash;nothing more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the young Godolphin&mdash;the boy who, at so early an age, has made
      himself known for his eccentric life abroad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is his son; the present owner of those ruins, and, I fear, of little
      more, unless it be the remains of a legacy received from a relation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was the father extravagant, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not he! But his father had exceeded a patrimony greatly involved, and
      greatly reduced from its ancient importance. All the lands we see yonder&mdash;-those
      villages, those woods&mdash;once belonged to the Godolphins. They were the
      most ancient and the most powerful family in this part of England; but the
      estates dwindled away with each successive generation, and when Arthur
      Godolphin, my Godolphin, succeeded to the property, nothing was left for
      him but the choice of three evils&mdash;a profession, obscurity, or a
      wealthy marriage. My father, who had long destined me for Lord Erpingham,
      insinuated that it was in me that Mr. Godolphin wished to find the
      resource I have last mentioned, and that in such resource was my only
      attraction in his eyes. I have some reason to believe he proposed to the
      Duke; but he was silent to me, from whom, girl as I was, he might have
      been less certain of refusal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he at last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married a lady who was supposed to be an heiress; but he had scarcely
      enjoyed her fortune a year before it became the subject of a lawsuit. He
      lost the cause and the dowry; and, what was worse, the expenses of
      litigation, and the sums he was obliged to refund, reduced him to what,
      for a man of his rank, might be considered absolute poverty. He was
      thoroughly chagrined and soured by this event; retired to those ruins, or
      rather to the small cottage that adjoins them, and there lived to the day
      of his death, shunning society, and certainly not exceeding his income."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you: he became parsimonious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the excess which his neighbours called miserly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And his wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor woman! she was a mere fine lady, and died, I believe, of the same
      vexation which nipped, not the life, but the heart of her husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had they only one son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only the present owner: Percy, I think&mdash;yes, Percy; it was his
      mother's surname&mdash;Percy Godolphin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how came this poor boy to be thrown so early on the world? Did he
      quarrel with Mr. Godolphin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe not: but when Percy was about sixteen, he left the obscure
      school at which he was educated, and resided for some little time with a
      relation, Augustus Saville. He stayed with him in London for about a year,
      and went everywhere with him, though so mere a boy. His manners were, I
      well remember, assured and formed. A relation left him some moderate
      legacy, and afterwards he went abroad alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the ruins! The late Mr. Godolphin, notwithstanding his reserve, did
      not object to indulging the curiosity of his neighbours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: he was proud of the interest the ruins of his hereditary mansion so
      generally excited,&mdash;proud of their celebrity in print-shops and in
      tours; but he himself was never seen. The cottage in which he lived,
      though it adjoins the ruins, was, of course, sacred from intrusion, and is
      so walled in, that that great delight of English visitors at show-places&mdash;peeping
      in at windows&mdash;was utterly forbidden. However that be, during Mr.
      Godolphin's life, I never had courage to visit what, to me, would have
      been a melancholy scene now, the pain would be somewhat less; and since
      you wish it, suppose we drive over and visit the ruins to-morrow? It is
      the regular day for seeing them, by the by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not, dear Lady Erpingham, if it give you the least&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sweet girl," interrupted Lady Erpingham, when a servant approached to
      announce visitors at the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you go into the saloon, Constance?" said the elder lady, as,
      thinking still of love and Arthur Godolphin, she took her way to her
      dressing-room to renovate her rouge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been a pretty amusement to one of the lesser devils, if,
      during the early romance of Lady Erpingham's feelings towards Arthur
      Godolphin, he had foretold her the hour when she would tell how Arthur
      Godolphin died a miser&mdash;just five minutes before she repaired to the
      toilette to decorate the cheek of age for the heedless eyes of a common
      acquaintance. 'Tis the world's way! For my part, I would undertake to find
      a better world in that rookery opposite my windows.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      DESCRIPTION OF GODOLPHIN'S HOUSE.&mdash;THE FIRST INTERVIEW.&mdash;ITS
      EFFECT ON CONSTANCE.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," asked Constance, as, the next day, Lady Erpinghain and herself were
      performing the appointed pilgrimage to the ruins of Godolphin Priory, "if
      the late Mr. Godolphin, as he grew in years, acquired a turn of mind so
      penurious, was he not enabled to leave his son some addition to the pied
      de terre we are about to visit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must certainly have left some ready money," answered Lady Erpinghain.
      "But is it, after all, likely that so young a man as Percy Godolphin could
      have lived in the manner he has done without incurring debts? It is most
      probable that he had some recourse to those persons so willing to
      encourage the young and extravagant, and that repayment to them will more
      than swallow up any savings his father might have amassed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True enough!" said Constance; and the conversation glided into remarks on
      avaricious fathers and prodigal sons. Constance was witty on the subject,
      and Lady Erpingham laughed herself into excellent humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was considerably past noon when they arrived at the ruins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped before a small inn, at the entrance of a dismantled
      park; and, taking advantage of the beauty of the day, Lady Erpingham and
      Constance walked slowly towards the remains of the Priory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene, as they approached, was wild and picturesque in the extreme. A
      wide and glassy lake lay stretched beneath them: on the opposite side
      stood the ruins. The large oriel window&mdash;the Gothic arch&mdash;the
      broken, yet still majestic column, all embrowned and mossed with age, were
      still spared, and now mirrored themselves in the waveless and silent tide.
      Fragments of stone lay around, for some considerable distance, and the
      whole was backed by hills, covered with gloomy and thick woods of pine and
      fir. To the left, they saw the stream which fed the lake, stealing away
      through grassy banks, overgrown with the willow and pollard oak: and
      there, from one or two cottages, only caught in glimpses, thin wreaths of
      smoke rose in spires against the clear sky. To the right, the ground was
      broken into a thousand glens and hollows: the deer-loved fern, the golden
      broom, were scattered about profusely; and here and there were dense
      groves of pollards; or, at very rare intervals, some single tree decaying
      (for all round bore the seal of vassalage to Time), but mighty, and
      greenly venerable in its decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed over a bridge that, on either side of the stream, emerged,
      as it were, from a thick copse, they caught a view of the small abode that
      adjoined the ruins. It seemed covered entirely with ivy; and, so far from
      diminishing, tended rather to increase the romantic and imposing effect of
      the crumbling pile from which it grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      They opened a little gate at the other extremity of the bridge, and in a
      few minutes more, they stood at the entrance to the Priory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an oak door, studded with nails. The jessamine grew upon either
      side; and, to descend to a commonplace matter, they had some difficulty in
      finding the bell among the leaves in which it was imbedded. When they had
      found and touched it, its clear and lively sound rang out in that still
      and lovely though desolate spot, with an effect startling and impressive
      from its contrast. There is something very fairy-like in the cheerful
      voice of a bell sounding among the wilder scenes of nature, particularly
      where Time advances his claim to the sovereignty of the landscape; for the
      cheerfulness is a little ghostly, and might serve well enough for a tocsin
      to the elvish hordes whom our footsteps may be supposed to disturb.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old woman, in the neat peasant dress of our country, when, taking a
      little from the fashion of the last century (the cap and the kerchief), it
      assumes no ungraceful costume,&mdash;replied to their summons. She was the
      solitary cicerone of the place. She had lived there, a lone and childless
      widow, for thirty years; and, of all the persons I have ever seen, would
      furnish forth the best heroine to one of those pictures of homely life
      which Wordsworth has dignified with the partriarchal tenderness of his
      genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wound a narrow passage, and came to the ruins of the great hall. Its
      gothic arches still sprang lightly upward on either side; and, opening a
      large stone box that stood in a recess, the old woman showed them the
      gloves, and the helmet, and the tattered banners, which had belonged to
      that Godolphin who had fought side by side with Sidney, when he, whose
      life&mdash;as the noblest of British lyrists hath somewhere said&mdash;was
      "poetry put into action,"(1) received his death-wound in the field of
      Zutphen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence they ascended by the dilapidated and crumbling staircase, to a
      small room, in which the visitors were always expected to rest themselves,
      and enjoy the scene in the garden below. A large chasm yawned where the
      casement once was; and round this aperture the ivy wreathed itself in
      fantastic luxuriance. A sort of ladder, suspended from this chasm to the
      ground, afforded a convenience for those who were tempted to a short
      excursion by the view without.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the view <i>was</i> tempting! A smooth green lawn, surrounded by
      shrubs and flowers, was ornamented in the centre by a fountain. The waters
      were, it is true, dried up; but the basin, and the "Triton with his
      wreathed shell," still remained. A little to the right was an old monkish
      sun-dial; and through the green vista you caught the glimpse of one of
      those gray, grotesque statues with which the taste of Elizabeth's day
      shamed the classic chisel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something quiet and venerable about the whole place; and when
      the old woman said to Constance, "Would you not like, my lady, to walk
      down and look at the sun-dial and the fountain?" Constance felt she
      required nothing more to yield to her inclination. Lady Erpingham, less
      adventurous, remained in the ruined chamber; and the old woman, naturally
      enough, honoured the elder lady with her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance, therefore, descended the rude steps alone. As she paused by the
      fountain, an indescribable and delicious feeling of repose stole over a
      mind that seldom experienced any sentiment so natural or so soft. The
      hour, the stillness, the scene, all conspired to lull the heart into that
      dreaming and half-unconscious reverie in which poets would suppose the
      hermits of elder times to have wasted a life, indolent, and yet scarcely,
      after all, unwise. "Methinks," she inly soliloquised, "while I look
      around, I feel as if I could give up my objects of life; renounce my
      hopes; forget to be artificial and ambitious; live in these ruins, and,"
      (whispered the spirit within,) "loved and loving, fulfil the ordinary doom
      of woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Indulging a mood, which the proud and restless Constance, who despised
      love as the poorest of human weaknesses, though easily susceptible to all
      other species of romance, had scarcely ever known before, she wandered
      away from the lawn into one of the alleys cut amidst the grove around.
      Caught by the murmur of an unseen brook, she tracked it through the trees,
      as its sound grew louder and louder on her ear, till at length it stole
      upon her sight. The sun, only winning through the trees at intervals,
      played capriciously upon the cold and dark waters as they glided on, and
      gave to her, as the same effect has done to a thousand poets, ample matter
      for a simile or a moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      She approached the brook, and came unawares upon the figure of a young
      man, leaning against a stunted tree that overhung the waters, and occupied
      with the idle amusement of dropping pebbles in the stream. She saw only
      his profile; but that view is, in a fine countenance, almost always the
      most striking and impressive, and it was eminently so in the face before
      her. The stranger, who was scarcely removed from boyhood, was dressed in
      deep mourning. He seemed slight, and small of stature. A travelling cap of
      sables contrasted, not hid, light brown hair of singular richness and
      beauty. His features were of that pure and severe Greek of which the only
      fault is that in the very perfection of the chiselling of the features
      there seems something hard and stern. The complexion was pale, even to
      wanness; and the whole cast and contour of the head were full of
      intellect, and betokening that absorption of mind which cannot be marked
      in any one without exciting a certain vague curiosity and interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      So dark and wondrous are the workings of our nature, that there are
      scarcely any of us, however light and unthinking, who would not be
      arrested by the countenance of one in deep reflection&mdash;who would not
      pause, and long to pierce into the mysteries that were agitating that
      world, most illimitable by nature, but often most narrowed by custom&mdash;the
      world within.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this interest, powerful as it is, spelled and arrested Constance at
      once. She remained for a minute gazing on the countenance of the young
      stranger, and then she&mdash;the most self-possessed and stately of human
      creatures&mdash;blushing deeply, and confused though unseen, turned
      lightly away and stopped not on her road till she regained the old chamber
      and Lady Erpingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman was descanting upon the merits of the late Lord of Godolphin
      Priory,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "For though they called him close, and so forth, my lady, yet he was
      generous to others; it was only himself he pinched. But, to be sure, the
      present squire won't take after him there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Mr. Percy Godolphin been here lately?" asked Lady Erpingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is at the cottage now, my lady," replied the old woman. "He came two
      days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he like his father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! not near so fine-looking a gentleman! much smaller, and quite
      pale-like. He seems sickly: them foreign parts do nobody no good. He was
      as fine a lad at sixteen years old as ever I seed; but now he is not like
      the same thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      So then it was evidently Percy Godolphin whom Constance had seen by the
      brook&mdash;the owner of a home without coffers, and estates without a
      rent-roll&mdash;the Percy Godolphin, of whom, before he had attained the
      age when others have left the college, or even the school, every one had
      learned to speak&mdash;some favourably, all with eagerness. Constance felt
      a vague interest respecting him spring up in her mind. She checked it, for
      it was a sin in her eye to think with interest on a man neither rich nor
      powerful; and as she quitted the ruins with Lady Erpingham, she
      communicated to the latter her adventure. She was, however, disingenuous;
      for though Godolphin's countenance was exactly of that cast which
      Constance most admired, she described him just as the old woman had done;
      and Lady Erpingham figured to herself, from the description, a little
      yellow man, with white hair and a turned-up nose. O Truth! what a hard
      path is thine! Does any keep it for three inches together in the commonest
      trifle?&mdash;and yet two sides of my library are filled with histories!

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A BALL ANNOUNCED.&mdash;GODOLPHIN'S VISTT TO WENDOVER CASTLE.&mdash;HIS
      MANNERS AND CONVERSATION.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Erpingham (besides her daughter, Lady Eleanor, married to Mr. Clare,
      a county member, of large fortune) was blessed with one son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present Earl had been for the last two years abroad. He had never,
      since his accession to his title, visited Wendover Castle; and Lady
      Erpingham one morning experienced the delight of receiving a letter from
      him, dated Dover, and signifying his intention of paying her a visit. In
      honour of this event, Lady Erpingham resolved to give a grand ball. Cards
      were issued to all the families in the county; and, among others, to Mr.
      Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day after this invitation had been sent to the person I have
      last named, as Lady Erpingham and Constance were alone in the saloon, Mr.
      Percy Godolphin was announced. Constance blushed as she looked up, and
      Lady Erpingham was struck by the nobleness of his address, and the perfect
      self-possession of his manner. And yet nothing could be so different as
      was his deportment from that which she had been accustomed to admire&mdash;from
      that manifested by the exquisites of the day. The calm, the nonchalance,
      the artificial smile of languor, the evenness, so insipid, yet so
      irreproachable, of English manners when considered most polished,&mdash;all
      this was the reverse of Godolphin's address and air. In short, in all he
      said or did there was something foreign, something unfamiliar. He was
      abrupt and enthusiastic in conversation, and used gestures in speaking.
      His countenance lighted up at every word that broke from hint on the
      graver subjects of discussion. You felt, indeed, with him that you were
      with a man of genius&mdash;a wayward and a spoiled man, who had acquired
      his habits in solitude, but his graces in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      They conversed about the ruins of the Priory, and Constance expressed her
      admiration of their romantic and picturesque beauty. "Ah!" said he
      smiling, but with a slight blush, in which Constance detected something of
      pain; "I heard of your visit to my poor heaps of stone. My father took
      great pleasure in the notice they attracted. When a proud man has not
      riches to be proud of, he grows proud of the signs of his poverty itself.
      This was the case with my poor father. Had he been rich, the ruins would
      not have existed: he would have rebuilt the old mansion. As he was poor,
      he valued himself on their existence, and fancied magnificence in every
      handful of moss. But all life is delusion: all pride, all vanity, all
      pomp, are equally deceit. Like the Spanish hidalgo, we put on spectacles
      when we eat our cherries, in order that they may seem ten times as big as
      they are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance smiled; and Lady Erpingham, who had more kindness than delicacy,
      continued her praises of the Priory and the scenery round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old park," said she, "with its wood and water, is so beautiful! It
      wants nothing but a few deer, just tame enough to come near the ruins, and
      wild enough to start away as you approach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you would borrow an attraction from wealth," said Godolphin, who,
      unlike English persons in general, seemed to love alluding to his poverty:
      "it is not for the owner of a ruined Priory to consult the aristocratic
      enchantments of that costly luxury, the Picturesque. Alas! I have not even
      wherewithal to feed a few solitary partridges; and I hear, that if I go
      beyond the green turf, once a park, I shall be warned off forthwith, and
      my very qualification disputed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you fond of shooting?" said Lady Erpingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy I should be; but I have never enjoyed the sport in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do pray come, then," said Lady Erpingham, kindly, "and spend your first
      week in September here. Let me see: the first of the month will be next
      Thursday; dine with us on Wednesday. We have keepers and dogs here enough,
      thanks to Robert; so you need only bring your gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind, dear Lady Erpingham," said Godolphin warmly: "I accept
      your invitation at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father was a very old friend of mine," said the lady with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was an old admirer," said the gentleman, with a bow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONVERSATION BETWEEN GODOLPHIN AND CONSTANCE.&mdash;THE COUNTRY LINE AND
      THE TOWN LINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Godolphin came on the appointed Wednesday. He was animated that day
      even to brilliancy. Lady Erpingham thought him the most charming of men;
      and even Constance forgot that he was no match for herself. Gifted and
      cultivated as she was, it was not without delight that she listened to his
      glowing descriptions of scenery, and to his playful yet somewhat
      melancholy strain of irony upon men and their pursuits. The peculiar
      features of her mind made her, indeed, like the latter more than she could
      appreciate the former; for in her nature there was more bitterness than
      sentiment. Still, his rich language and fluent periods, even in
      description, touched her ear and fancy, though they sank not to her heart;
      and she yielded insensibly to the spells she would almost have despised in
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, Constance, who was no very early riser, tempted by the
      beauty of the noon, strolled into the gardens. She was surprised to hear
      Godolphin's voice behind her: she turned round and he joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were on your shooting expedition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been shooting, and I am returned. I was out by daybreak, and I
      came back at noon in the hope of being allowed to join you in your ride or
      walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance smilingly acknowledged the compliment; and as they passed up the
      straight walks of the old-fashioned and stately gardens, Godolphin turned
      the conversation upon the varieties of garden scenery; upon the poets who
      have described those varieties best; upon that difference between the town
      life and the country, on which the brothers of the minstrel craft have, in
      all ages, so glowingly insisted. In this conversation, certain points of
      contrast between the characters of these two young persons might be
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess to you," said Godolphin, "that I have little faith in the
      permanence of any attachment professed for the country by the inhabitants
      of cities. If we can occupy our minds solely with the objects around us,&mdash;if
      the brook and the old tree, and the golden sunset, and the summer night,
      and the animal and homely life that we survey,&mdash;if these can fill our
      contemplation, and take away from us the feverish schemes of the future,&mdash;then
      indeed I can fully understand the reality of that tranquil and happy state
      which our elder poets have described as incident to a country life. But if
      we carry with us to the shade all the restless and perturbed desires of
      the city; if we only employ present leisure in schemes for an agitated
      future&mdash;then it is in vain that we affect the hermit and fly to the
      retreat. The moment the novelty of green fields is over, and our projects
      are formed, we wish to hurry to the city to execute them. We have, in a
      word, made our retirement only a nursery for schemes now springing up, and
      requiring to be transplanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said Constance, quickly; "and who would pass life as if
      it were a dream? It seems to me that we put retirement to the right use
      when we make it only subservient to our aims in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A strange doctrine for a young beauty," thought Godolphin, "whose head
      ought to be full of groves and love." "Then," said he aloud, "I must rank
      among those who abuse the purposes of retirement; for I have hitherto been
      flattered to think that I enjoy it for itself. Despite the artificial life
      I have led, everything that speaks of nature has a voice that I can rarely
      resist. What feelings created in a city can compare with those that rise
      so gently and so unbidden within us when the trees and the waters are our
      only companions&mdash;our only sources of excitement and intoxication? Is
      not contemplation better than ambition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you believe it?" said Constance, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance smiled; and there would have been contempt in that beautiful
      smile, had not Godolphin interested her in spite of herself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE FEELINGS OF CONSTANCE AND GODOLPHIN TOWARDS EACH OTHER.&mdash;THE
      DISTINCTION IN THEIR CHARACTERS.&mdash;REMARKS ON THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY
      THE WORLD UPON GODOLPHIN.&mdash;THE HIDE.&mdash;RURAL DESCRIPTIONS.&mdash;OMENS.&mdash;THE
      FIRST INDISTINCT CONFESSION.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day, at the hour in which Constance was visible, Godolphin had
      loaded the keeper, and had returned to attend upon her movements. They
      walked and rode together; and in the evening, Godolphin hung over her
      chair, and listened to her songs; for though, as I have before said, she
      had but little science in instrumental music, her voice was rich and soft
      beyond the pathos of ordinary singers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Erpingham saw, with secret delight, what she believed to be a growing
      attachment. She loved Constance for herself, and Godolphin for his
      father's memory. She thought again and again what a charming couple they
      would make&mdash;so handsome&mdash;so gifted: and if Prudence whispered
      also&mdash;so poor, the kind Countess remembered, that she herself had
      saved from her ample jointure a sum which she had always designed as a
      dowry for Constance, and which, should Godolphin be the bridegroom, she
      felt she should have a tenfold pleasure in bestowing. With this fortune,
      which would place them, at least, in independence, she united in her
      kindly imagination the importance which she imagined Godolphin's talents
      must ultimately acquire; and for which, in her aristocratic estimation,
      she conceived the senate the only legitimate sphere. She said, she hinted,
      nothing to Constance; but she suffered nature, youth, and companionship to
      exercise their sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the complexion of Godolphin's feelings for Constance Vernon did indeed
      resemble love&mdash;was love itself, though rather love in its romance
      than its reality. What were those of Constance for him? She knew not
      herself at that time. Had she been of a character one shade less
      ambitious, or less powerful, they would have been love, and love of no
      common character. But within her musing, and self-possessed, and
      singularly constituted mind, there was, as yet, a limit to every
      sentiment, a chain to the wings of every thought, save those of one order;
      and that order was not of love. There was a marked difference, in all
      respects, between the characters of the two; and it was singular enough,
      that that of the woman was the less romantic, and composed of the simpler
      materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      A volume of Wordsworth's most exquisite poetry had then just appeared. "Is
      not this wonderful?" said Godolphin, reciting some of those lofty, but
      refining thoughts which characterise the Pastor of modern poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you do not admire it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What poetry do you admire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Pope's translation of the Iliad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, to be sure," said Godolphin, a little vexed; "we all admire
      this in its way: but what else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance pointed to a passage in the Palamon and Arcite of Dryden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin threw down his Wordsworth. "You take an ungenerous advantage of
      me," said he. "Tell me something you admire, which, at least, I may have
      the privilege of disputing,&mdash;something that you think generally
      neglected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admire few things that are generally neglected," answered Constance,
      with her bright and proud smile. "Fame gives its stamp to all metal that
      is of intrinsic value."
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer was quite characteristic of Constance: she worshipped fame far
      more than the genius which won it. "Well, then," said Godolphin, "let us
      see now if we can come to a compromise of sentiment;" and he took up the
      Comus of Milton.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one read poetry so beautifully: his voice was so deep and flexible; and
      his countenance answered so well to every modulation of his voice.
      Constance was touched by the reader, but not by the verse. Godolphin had
      great penetration; he perceived it, and turned to the speeches of Satan in
      Paradise Lost. The noble countenance before him grew luminous at once: the
      lip quivered, the eye sparkled; the enthusiasm of Godolphin was not
      comparable to that of Constance. The fact was, that the broad and common
      emotions of the intellectual character struck upon the right key. Courage,
      defiance, ambition, these she comprehended to their fullest extent; but
      the rich subtleties of thought which mark the cold and bright page of the
      Comus; the noble Platonism&mdash;the high and rare love for what is
      abstractedly good, these were not "sonorous and trumpet-speaking" enough
      for the heart of one meant by Nature for a heroine or a queen, not a
      poetess or a philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all that in literature was delicate, and half-seen, and abstruse, had
      its peculiar charm for Godolphin. Of a reflective and refining mind, he
      had early learned to despise the common emotions of men: glory touched him
      not, and to ambition he had shut his heart. Love, with him&mdash;even
      though he had been deemed, not unjustly, a man of gallantry and pleasure&mdash;love
      was not compounded of the ordinary elements of the passions. Full of
      dreams, and refinements, and intense abstractions, it was a love that
      seemed not homely enough for endurance, and of too rare a nature to hope
      for sympathy in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was in his intercourse with Constance, both were continually
      disappointed. "You do not feel this," said Constance. "She cannot
      understand me," sighed Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must not suppose&mdash;despite his refinements, and his reveries,
      and his love for the intellectual and the pure&mdash;that Godolphin was of
      a stainless character or mind. He was one who, naturally full of decided
      and marked qualities, was, by the peculiar elements of our society,
      rendered a doubtful, motley, and indistinct character, tinctured by the
      frailties that leave us in a wavering state between vice and virtue. The
      energies that had marked his boyhood were dulled and crippled in the
      indolent life of the world. His wandering habits for the last few years&mdash;the
      soft and poetical existence of the South&mdash;had fed his natural
      romance, and nourished that passion for contemplation which the
      intellectual man of pleasure so commonly forms; for pleasure has a
      philosophy of its own&mdash;a sad, a fanciful, yet deep persuasion of the
      vanity of all things&mdash;a craving after the bright ideal&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "The desire of the moth for the star."
</pre>
    <p>
      Solomon's thirst for pleasure was the companion of his wisdom: satiety was
      the offspring of the one&mdash;discontent of the other. But this
      philosophy, though seductive, is of no wholesome nor useful character; it
      is the philosophy of feelings, not principles&mdash;of the heart, not
      head. So with Godolphin: he was too refined in his moralising to cling to
      what was moral. The simply good and the simply bad he left for us plain
      folks to discover. He was unattracted by the doctrines of right and wrong
      which serve for all men; but he had some obscure and shadowy standard in
      his own mind by which he compared the actions of others. He had
      imagination, genius, even heart; was brilliant always, sometimes profound;
      graceful in society, yet seldom social: a lonely man, yet a man of the
      world; generous to individuals, selfish to the mass. How many fine
      qualities worse than thrown away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Who will not allow that he has met many such men?&mdash;and who will not
      follow this man to his end?
    </p>
    <p>
      One day (it was the last of Godolphin's protracted visit) as the sun was
      waning to its close, and the time was unusually soft and tranquil,
      Constance and Godolphin were returning slowly home from their customary
      ride. They passed by a small inn, bearing the common sign of the
      "Chequers," round which a crowd of peasants were assembled, listening to
      the rude music which a wandering Italian boy drew from his guitar. The
      scene was rustic and picturesque; and as Godolphin reined in his horse and
      gazed on the group, he little dreamed of the fierce and dark emotions with
      which, at a far distant period, he was destined to revisit that spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our peasants," said he, as they rode on, "require some humanising
      relaxation like that we have witnessed. The music and the morris-dance
      have gone from England; and instead of providing, as formerly, for the
      amusement of the grinded labourer, our legislators now regard with the
      most watchful jealousy his most distant approach to festivity. They cannot
      bear the rustic to be merry: disorder and amusement are words for the same
      offence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt," said the earnest Constance, "whether the legislators are not
      right. For men given to amusement are easily enslaved. All noble thoughts
      are grave."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus talking, they passed a shallow ford in the stream. "We are not far
      from the Priory," said Godolphin, pointing to its ruins, that rose greyly
      in the evening skies from the green woods around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance sighed involuntarily. She felt pain in being reminded of the
      slender fortunes of her companion. Ascending the gentle hill that swelled
      from the stream, she now, to turn the current of her thoughts, pointed
      admiringly to the blue course of the waters, as they wound through their
      shagged banks. And deep, dark, rushing, even at that still hour, went the
      stream through the boughs that swept over its surface. Here and there the
      banks suddenly shelved down, mingling with the waves; then abruptly they
      rose, overspread with thick and tangled umbrage, several feet above the
      level of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange it is," said Godolphin, "that at times a feeling comes over
      us, as we gaze upon certain places, which associates the scene either with
      some dim-remembered and dream-like images of the Past, or with a prophetic
      and fearful omen of the Future! As I gaze now upon this spot&mdash;those
      banks&mdash;that whirling river&mdash;it seems as if my destiny claimed a
      mysterious sympathy with the scene: when&mdash;how-wherefore&mdash;I know
      not&mdash;guess not: only this shadowy and chilling sentiment
      unaccountably creeps over me. Every one has known a similar strange,
      indistinct, feeling at certain times and places, and with a similar
      inability to trace the cause. And yet, is it not singular that in poetry,
      which wears most feelings to an echo, I leave never met with any attempt
      to describe it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because poetry," said Constance, "is, after all, but a hackneyed
      imitation of the most common thoughts, giving them merely a gloss by the
      brilliancy of verse. And yet how little poets <i>know!</i> They <i>imagine,</i>
      and they <i>imitate;</i>&mdash;behold all their secrets!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you are right," said Godolphin, musingly; "and I, who have often
      vainly fancied I had the poetical temperament, have been so chilled and
      sickened by the characteristics of the tribe, that I have checked its
      impulses with a sort of disdain; and thus the Ideal, having no vent in me,
      preys within, creating a thousand undefined dreams and unwilling
      superstitions, making me enamoured of the Shadowy and Unknown, and
      dissatisfying me with the petty ambitions of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will awake hereafter," said Constance, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin shook his head, and replied not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their way now lay along a green lane that gradually wound round a hill
      commanding a view of great richness and beauty. Cottages, and spires, and
      groves, gave life&mdash;but it was scattered and remote life&mdash;to the
      scene; and the broad stream, whose waves, softened in the distance, did
      not seem to break the even surface of the tide, flowed onward, glowing in
      the sunlight, till it was lost among dark and luxuriant woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both once more arrested their horses by a common impulse, and both became
      suddenly silent as they gazed. Godolphin was the first to speak: it
      brought to his memory a scene in that delicious land, whose Southern
      loveliness Claude has transfused to the canvas, and De Stael to the page.
      With his own impassioned and earnest language, he spoke to Constance of
      that scene and that country. Every tree before him furnished matter for
      his illustration or his contrast; and, as she heard that magic voice, and
      speaking, too, of a country dedicated to love, Constance listened with
      glistening eyes, and a cheek which he,&mdash;consummate master of the
      secrets of womanhood&mdash;perceived was eloquent with thoughts which she
      knew not, but which <i>he</i> interpreted to the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in such a spot," said he, continuing, and fixing his deep and
      animated gaze on her,&mdash;"in such a spot I could have stayed for ever
      but for one recollection, one feeling&mdash;<i>I should have been too much
      alone!</i> In a wild or a grand, or even a barren country, we may live in
      solitude, and find fit food for thought; but not in one so soft, so
      subduing, as that which I saw and see. Love comes over us then in spite of
      ourselves; and I feel&mdash;I feel now"&mdash;his voice trembled as he
      spoke&mdash;"that any secret we may before have nursed, though hitherto
      unacknowledged, makes itself at length a voice. We are oppressed with the
      desire to be loved; we long for the courage to say we love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had Godolphin, though constantly verging into sentiment,
      spoken to Constance in so plain a language. Eye, voice, cheek&mdash;all
      spoke. She felt that he had confessed he loved her! And was she not happy
      at that thought? She was: it was her happiest moment. But, in that sort of
      vague and indistinct shrinking from the subject with which a woman who
      loves hears a disclosure of love from him on whose lips it is most sweet,
      she muttered some confused attempt to change the subject, and quickened
      her horse's pace. Godolphin did not renew the topic so interesting and so
      dangerous, only, as with the winding of the road the landscape gradually
      faded from their view, he said, in a low voice, as if to himself,&mdash;"How
      long, how fondly, shall I remember this day!"

    <p>
      GODOLPHIN'S RETURN HOME.&mdash;HIS SOLILOQUY.&mdash;LORD ERPINGHAM'S
      ARRIVAL AT WENDOVER CASTLE.&mdash;THE EARL DESCRIBED.&mdash;HIS ACCOUNT OF
      GODOLPHIN'S LIFE AT ROME.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a listless step, Godolphin re-entered the threshold of his
      cottage-home. He passed into a small chamber, which was yet the largest in
      his house. The poor and scanty furniture scattered around; the old,
      tuneless, broken harpsichord; the worn and tattered carpet; the tenantless
      birdcage in the recess by the window; the bookshelves, containing some
      dozens of worthless volumes; the sofa of the last century (when, if people
      knew comfort, they placed it not in lounging) small, narrow, highbacked,
      hard, and knotted; these, just as his father had left, just as his boyhood
      had seen, them, greeted him with a comfortless and chill, though familiar
      welcome. It was evening: he ordered a fire and lights; and leaning his
      face on his hand as he contemplated the fitful and dusky outbreakings of
      the flame through the bars of the niggard and contracted grate, he sat
      himself down to hold commune with his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, I love this woman," said he, "do I? Have I not deceived myself? She
      is poor&mdash;no connection; she has nothing whereby to reinstate my
      house's fortunes, to rebuild this mansion, or repurchase yonder demesnes.
      I love her! <i>I</i> who have known the value of her sex so well, that I
      have said, again and again, I would not shackle life with a princess! Love
      may withstand possession&mdash;true&mdash;but not time. In three years
      there would be no glory in the face of Constance, and I should be&mdash;what?
      My fortunes, broken as they are, can support me alone, and with my few
      wants. But if married! the haughty Constance my wife! Nay, nay, nay! this
      must not be thought of! I, the hero of Paris! the pupil of Saville! I, to
      be so beguiled as even to <i>dream</i> of such a madness!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet I have that within me that might make a stir in the world&mdash;I
      might rise. Professions are open; the Diplomacy, the House of Commons.
      What! Percy Godolphin be ass enough to grow ambitious! to toil, to fret,
      to slave, to answer fools on a first principle, and die at length of a
      broken heart for a lost place! Pooh, pooh! I, who despise your prime
      ministers, can scarcely stoop to their apprenticeship. Life is too short
      for toil. And what do men strive for?&mdash;to enjoy: but why not enjoy
      without the toil? And relinquish Constance? Ay, it is but one woman lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended the soliloquy of a man scarcely of age. The world teaches us its
      last lessons betimes; but then, lest we should have nothing left to
      acquire from its wisdom, it employs the rest of our life in unlearning all
      that it first taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the time approached when Lord Erpingham was to arrive at
      Wendover Castle; and at length came the day itself. Naturally anxious to
      enjoy as exclusively as possible the company of her son the first day of
      his return from so long an absence, Lady Erpingham had asked no one to
      meet him. The earl's heavy travelling-carriage at length rolled clattering
      up the court-yard; and in a few minutes a tall man, in the prime of life,
      and borrowing some favourable effect as to person from the large cloak of
      velvet and furs which hung round him, entered the room, and Lady Erpingham
      embraced her son. The kind and familiar manner with which he answered her
      inquiries and congratulations was somewhat changed when he suddenly
      perceived Constance. Lord Erpingham was a cold man, and, like most cold
      men, ashamed of the evidence of affection. He greeted Constance very
      quietly; and, as she thought, slightly: but his eyes turned to her far
      more often than any friend of Lord Erpingham's might ever have remarked
      those large round hazel eyes turn to any one before.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the earl withdrew to adjust his toilet for dinner, Lady Erpingham, as
      she wiped her eyes, could not help exclaiming to Constance, "Is he not
      handsome? What a figure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was a little addicted to flattery where she liked the one who
      was to be flattered, and she assented readily enough to the maternal
      remark. Hitherto, however, she had not observed anything more in Lord
      Erpingham than his height and his cloak: as he re-entered and led her to
      the dining-room she took a better, though still but a casual, survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Erpingham was that sort of person of whom <i>men</i> always say,
      "What a prodigiously fine fellow!" He was above six feet high, stout in
      proportion: not, indeed, accurately formed, nor graceful in bearing, but
      quite as much so as a man of six feet high need be. He had a manly
      complexion of brown, yellow, and red. His whiskers were exceedingly large,
      black, and well arranged. His eyes, as I have before said, were round,
      large, and hazel; they were also unmeaning. His teeth were good; and his
      nose, neither aquiline nor Grecian, was yet a very showy nose upon the
      whole. All the maidservants admired him; and you felt, in looking at him,
      that it was a pity our army should lose so good a grenadier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Erpingham was a Whig of the old school: he thought the Tory boroughs
      ought to be thrown open. He was generally considered a sensible man. He
      had read Blackstone, Montesquieu, Cowper's Poems, and <i>The Rambler</i>;
      and he was always heard with great attention in the House of Lords. In his
      moral character he was a bon Vivant, as far as wine is concerned; for
      choice <i>eating</i> he cared nothing. He was good-natured, but close;
      brave enough to fight a duel, if necessary; and religious enough to go to
      church once a week&mdash;in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far Lord Erpingham might seem modelled from one of Sir Walter's heroes:
      we must reverse the medal, and show the points in which he differed from
      those patterns of propriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the generality of his class, he was peculiarly loose in his notions
      of women, though not ardent in pursuit of them. His amours had been among
      opera-dancers, "because," as he was wont to say, "there was no d&mdash;d
      bore with <i>them.</i>" Lord Erpingham was always considered a high-minded
      man. People chose him as an umpire in quarrels; and told a story (which
      was not true) of his having held some state office for a whole year, and
      insisted on returning the emoluments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Robert Earl of Erpingham. During dinner, at which he displayed,
      to his mother's great delight, a most excellent appetite, he listened, as
      well as he might, considering the more legitimate occupation of the time
      and season, to Lady Erpingham's recitals of county history; her long
      answers to his brief inquiries whether old friends were dead and young
      ones married; and his countenance brightened up to an expression of
      interest&mdash;almost of intelligence&mdash;when he was told that birds
      were said to be plentiful. As the servants left the room, and Lord
      Erpingham took his first glass of claret, the conversation fell upon Percy
      Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been staying with us a whole fortnight," said Lady Erpingham;
      "and, by the by, he said he had met you in Italy, and mentioned your name
      as it deserved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! And did he really condescend to praise me?" said Lord Erpingham,
      with eagerness; for there was that about Godolphin, and his reputation for
      fastidiousness, which gave a rarity and a value to his praise, at least to
      lordly ears. "Ah! he's a queer fellow; he led a very singular life in
      Italy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I have always heard," said Lady Erpingham. "But of what description?
      was he very wild?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not exactly: there was a good deal of mystery about him: he saw very
      few English, and those were chiefly men who played high. He was said to
      have a great deal of learning and so forth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! then he was surrounded, I suppose, by those medalists and
      picture-sellers, and other impostors, who live upon such of our countrymen
      as think themselves blessed with a taste or afflicted with a genius," said
      Lady Erpingham; who, having lived with the wits and orators of the time,
      had caught mechanically their way of rounding a period.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from it!" returned the earl. "Godolphin is much too deep a fellow for
      that; he's not easily taken in, I assure you. I confess I don't like him
      the worse for that," added the close noble. "But he lived with the Italian
      doctors and men of science; and encouraged, in particular, one strange
      fellow who affected sorcery, I fancy, or something very like it. Godolphin
      resided in a very lonely spot at Rome: and I believe laboratories, and
      caldrons, and all sorts of devilish things, were always at work there&mdash;at
      least so people said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," said Constance, "you thought him too sensible to be easily
      taken in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I do, Miss Vernon; and the proof of it is, that no man has less
      fortune or is made more of. He plays, it is true, but only occasionally;
      though as a player at games of skill&mdash;piquet, billiards, whist,&mdash;he
      has no equal, unless it be Saville. But then Saville, entre noun, is
      suspected of playing unfairly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are quite sure," said the placid Lady Erpingham, "that Mr.
      Godolphin is only indebted to skill for his success?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance darted a glance of fire at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, faith, I believe so! No one ever accused him of a single shabby, or
      even suspicious trick; and indeed, as I said before, no one was ever more
      sought after in society, though he shuns it; and he's devilish right, for
      it's a cursed bore!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Robert! at your age!" exclaimed the mother. "But," continued the
      earl, turning to Constance,&mdash;"but, Miss Vernon, a man may have his
      weak point; and the cunning Italian may have hit on Godolphin's, clever as
      he is in general; though, for my part, I will tell you frankly, I think he
      only encouraged him to mystify and perplex people, just to get talked of&mdash;vanity,
      in short. He's a good-looking fellow that Godolphin&mdash;eh?" continued
      the earl, in the tone of a man who meant you to deny what he asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, beautiful!" said Lady Erpingham. "Such a countenance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deuced pale, though!&mdash;eh?&mdash;and not the best of figures: thin,
      narrow-shouldered, eh&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin's proportions were faultless; but your strapping heroes think of
      a moderate-sized man as mathematicians define a point&mdash;declare that
      he has no length nor breadth whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What say <i>you,</i> Constance?" asked Lady Erpingham, meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance felt the meaning, and replied calmly, that Mr. Godolphin
      appeared to her handsomer than any one she had seen lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Erpingham played with his neckcloth, and Lady Erpingham rose to leave
      the room. "D&mdash;d fine girl!" said the earl, as he shut the door upon
      Constance;&mdash;"but d&mdash;d sharp!" added he, as he resettled himself
      on his chair.

      CHAPTER XVII.

      CONSTANCE AT HER TOILET.&mdash;HER FEELINGS.&mdash;HER CHARACTER OF BEAUTY

      PASSES BETWEEN GODOLPHIN AND CONSTANCE.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of the ball to be given in honour of Lord Erpingham's
      arrival. Constance, dressed for conquest, sat alone in her dressing-room.
      Her woman had just left her. The lights still burned in profusion about
      the antique chamber (antique, for it was situated in the oldest part of
      the castle); those lights streamed full upon the broad brow and exquisite
      features of Miss Vernon. As she leaned back in her chair&mdash;the fairy
      foot upon the low Gothic stool, and the hands drooping beside her
      despondingly&mdash;her countenance betrayed much, but not serene, thought;
      and, mixed with that thought, was something of irresolution and of great
      and real sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not, as I have before hinted, to be supposed that Constance's lot
      had been hitherto a proud one, even though she was the most admired beauty
      of her day; even though she lived with, and received adulation from, the
      high, and noble, and haughty of her land. Often, in the glittering crowd
      that she attracted around her, her ear, sharpened by the jealousy and
      pride of her nature, caught words that dashed the cup of pleasure and of
      vanity with shame and anger. "What! that <i>the</i> Vernon's daughter?
      Poor girl! dependent entirely on Lady Erpingham! Ah! she'll take in some
      rich roturier, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such words from ill-tempered dowagers and faded beauties were no
      unfrequent interruption to her brief-lived and wearisome triumphs. She
      heard manoeuvring mothers caution their booby sons, whom Constance would
      have looked into the dust had they dared but to touch her hand, against
      her untitled and undowried charms. She saw cautious earls, who were all
      courtesy one night, all coldness another, as some report had reached them
      accusing their hearts of feeling too deeply her attractions, or, as they
      themselves suspected, for the first time, that a heart was not a word for
      a poetical nothing, and that to look on so beautiful and glorious a
      creature was sufficient to convince them, even yet, of the possibility of
      emotion. She had felt to the quick the condescending patronage of
      duchesses and chaperons; the oblique hint; the nice and fine distinction
      which, in polished circles, divides each grade from the other, and allows
      you to be galled without the pleasure of feeling justified in offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, which, in the flush and heyday of youth, and gaiety, and
      loveliness, would have been unnoticed by other women, rankled deep in the
      mind of Constance Vernon. The image of her dying father, his complaints,
      his accusations (the justice of which she never for an instant
      questioned), rose up before her in the brightest hours of the dance and
      the revel. She was not one of those women whose meek and gentle nature
      would fly what wounds them: Constance had resolved to conquer. Despising
      glitter and gaiety, and show, she burned, she thirsted for power&mdash;a
      power which could retaliate the insults she fancied she had received, and
      should turn condescension into homage. This object, which every casual
      word, every heedless glance from another, fixed deeper and deeper in her
      heart, took a sort of sanctity from the associations with which she linked
      it&mdash;her father's memory and his dying breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment in which we have portrayed her, all these restless, and
      sore, and haughty feelings were busy within; but they were combated, even
      while the more fiercely aroused, by one soft and tender thought&mdash;the
      image of Godolphin&mdash;of Godolphin, the spendthrift heir of a broken
      fortune and a fallen house. She felt too deeply that she loved him; and,
      ignorant of his worldlier qualities, imagined that he loved her with all
      the devotion of that romance, and the ardour of that genius, which
      appeared to her to compose his character. But this persuasion gave her now
      no delightful emotion. Convinced that she ought to reject him, his image
      only coloured with sadness those objects and that ambition which she had
      hitherto regarded with an exulting pride. She was not less bent on the
      lofty ends of her destiny; but the glory and the illusion had fallen from
      them. She had taken an insight into futurity, and felt, that to enjoy
      power was to lose happiness. Yet, with this full conviction, she forsook
      the happiness and clung to the power. Alas! for our best and wisest
      theories, our problems, our systems, our philosophy! Human beings will
      never cease to mistake the means for the end; and, despite the dogmas of
      sages, our conduct does not depend on our convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carriage after carriage had rolled beneath the windows of the room where
      Constance sat, and still she moved not; until at length a certain
      composure, as if the result of some determination, stole over her
      features. The brilliant and transparent hues returned to her cheek, and,
      as she rose and stood erect with a certain calmness and energy on her lip
      and forehead, perhaps her beauty had never seemed of so lofty and august a
      cast. In passing through the chamber, she stopped for a moment opposite
      the mirror that reflected her stately shape in its full height. Beauty is
      so truly the weapon of woman, that it is as impossible for her, even in
      grief, wholly to forget its effect, as it is for the flying warrior to
      look with indifference on the sword with which he has won his trophies or
      his fame. Nor was Constance that evening disposed to be indifferent to the
      effect she should produce. She looked on the reflection of herself with a
      feeling of triumph, not arising from vanity alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when did mirror ever give back a form more worthy of a Pericles to
      worship, or an Apelles to paint? Though but little removed from the common
      height, the impression Constance always gave was that of a person much
      taller than she really was. A certain majesty in the turn of the head, the
      fall of the shoulders, the breadth of the brow, and the exceeding calmness
      of the features, invested her with an air which I have never seen equalled
      by any one, but which, had Pasta been a beauty, she might have possessed.
      But there was nothing hard or harsh in this majesty. Whatsoever of a
      masculine nature Constance might have inherited, nothing masculine,
      nothing not exquisitely feminine, was visible in her person. Her shape was
      rounded, and sufficiently full to show, that in middle age its beauty
      would be preserved by that richness and freshness which a moderate
      increase of the proportions always gives to the sex. Her arms and hands
      were, and are, even to this day, of a beauty the more striking, because it
      is so rare. Nothing in any European country is more uncommon than an arm
      really beautiful both in hue and shape. In any assembly we go to, what
      miserable bones, what angular elbows, what red skins, do we see under the
      cover of those capacious sleeves, which are only one whit less ugly. At
      the time I speak of, those coverings were not worn; and the white, round,
      dazzling arm of Constance, bare almost to the shoulder, was girded by
      dazzling gems, which at once set off, and were foiled by, the beauty of
      nature. Her hair was of the most luxuriant, and of the deepest, black; and
      it was worn in a fashion&mdash;then uncommon, without being bizarre&mdash;now
      hackneyed by the plainest faces, though suiting only the highest order of
      beauty&mdash;I mean that simple and classic fashion to which the French
      have given a name borrowed from Calypso, but which appears to me suited
      rather to an intellectual than a voluptuous goddess. Her long lashes, and
      a brow delicately but darkly pencilled, gave additional eloquence to an
      eye of the deepest blue, and a classic contour to a profile so slightly
      aquiline, that it was commonly considered Grecian. That necessary
      completion to all real beauty of either sex, the short and curved upper
      lip, terminated in the most dazzling teeth and the ripe and dewy under lip
      added to what was noble in her beauty that charm also which is exclusively
      feminine. Her complexion was capricious; now pale, now tinged with the
      pink of the sea-shell, or the softest shade of the rose leaf: but in
      either it was so transparent, that you doubted which became her the most.
      To these attractions, add a throat, a bust of the most dazzling whiteness,
      and the justest proportions; a foot, whose least beauty was its smallness,
      and a waist narrow&mdash;not the narrowness of tenuity or constraint;&mdash;but
      round, gradual, insensibly less in its compression:&mdash;and the person
      of Constance Vernon, in the bloom of her youth, is before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed with her quiet and stately step from her room, through one
      adjoining it, and which we stop to notice, because it was her customary
      sitting-room when not with Lady Erpingham. There had Godolphin, with the
      foreign but courtly freedom, the respectful and chivalric ease of his
      manners, often sought her; there had he lingered in order to detain her
      yet a moment and a moment longer from other company, seeking a sweet
      excuse in some remark on the books that strewed the tables, or the music
      in that recess, or the forest scene from those windows through which the
      moon of autumn now stole with its own peculiar power to soften and subdue.
      As these recollections came across her, her step faltered and her colour
      faded from its glow: she paused a moment, cast a mournful glance round the
      room, and then tore herself away, descended the lofty staircase, passed
      the stone hall, melancholy with old banners and rusted crests, and bore
      her beauty and her busy heart into the thickening and gay crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eye looked once more round for the graceful form of Godolphin: but he
      was not visible; and she had scarcely satisfied herself of this before
      Lord Erpingham, the hero of the evening, approached and claimed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just performed my duty," said he, with a gallantry of speech not
      common to him, "now for my reward. I have danced the first dance with Lady
      Margaret Midgecombe: I come, according to your promise, to dance the
      second with you."

    <p>
      There was something in these words that stung one of the morbid
      remembrances in Miss Vernon's mind. Lady Margaret Midgecombe, in ordinary
      life, would have been thought a good-looking, vulgar girl:&mdash;she was a
      Duke's daughter and she was termed a Hebe. Her little nose, and her fresh
      colour, and her silly but not unmalicious laugh, were called enchanting;
      and all irregularities of feature and faults of shape were absolutely
      turned into merits by that odd commendation, so common with us&mdash;"A
      deuced fine girl; none of your regular beauties."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only in the county of &mdash;&mdash;shire, but in London, had Lady
      Margaret Midgecombe been set up as the rival beauty of Constance Vernon.
      And Constance, far too lovely, too cold, too proud, not to acknowledge
      beauty in others, where it really existed, was nevertheless unaffectedly
      indignant at a comparison so unworthy; she even, at times, despised her
      own claims to admiration, since claims so immeasurably inferior could be
      put into competition with them. Added to this sore feeling for Lady
      Margaret, was one created by Lady Margaret's mother. The Duchess of
      Winstoun was a woman of ordinary birth&mdash;the daughter of a peer of
      great wealth but new family. She had married, however, one of the most
      powerful dukes in the peerage;&mdash;a stupid, heavy, pompous man, with
      four castles, eight parks, a coal-mine, a tin-mine, six boroughs, and
      about thirty livings. Inactive and reserved, the duke was seldom seen in
      public: the care of supporting his rank devolved on the duchess; and she
      supported it with as much solemnity of purpose as if she had been a
      cheesemonger's daughter. Stately, insolent, and coarse; asked everywhere;
      insulting all; hated and courted; such was the Duchess of Winstoun, and
      such, perhaps, have been other duchesses before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be it understood that, at that day, Fashion had not risen to the despotism
      it now enjoys: it took its colouring from Power, not controlled it. I
      shall show, indeed, how much of its present condition that Fashion owes to
      the Heroine of these Memoirs. The Duchess of Winstoun could not now be
      that great person she was then: there is a certain good taste in Fashion
      which repels the mere insolence of flank&mdash;which requires persons to
      be either agreeable, or brilliant, or at least original&mdash;which weighs
      stupid dukes in a righteous balance and finds vulgar duchesses wanting.
      But in lack of this new authority this moral sebastocrator between the
      Sovereign and the dignity hitherto considered next to the Sovereign's&mdash;her
      Grace of Winstoun exercised with impunity the rights of insolence. She had
      taken an especial dislike to Constance:&mdash;partly because the few good
      judges of beauty, who care neither for rank nor report, had very
      unreservedly placed Miss Vernon beyond the reach of all competition with
      her daughter; and principally, because the high spirit and keen irony of
      Constance had given more than once to the duchess's effrontery so cutting
      and so public a check, that she had felt with astonishment and rage there
      was one woman in that world&mdash;that woman too unmarried&mdash;who could
      retort the rudeness of the Duchess of Winstoun. Spiteful, however, and
      numerous were the things she said of Miss Vernon, when Miss Vernon was
      absent; and haughty beyond measure were the inclination of her head and
      the tone of her voice when Miss Vernon was present. If, therefore,
      Constance was disliked by the duchess, we may readily believe that she
      returned the dislike. The very name roused her spleen and her pride; and
      it was with a feeling all a woman's, though scarcely feminine in the
      amiable sense of the word, that she learned to whom the honour of Lord
      Erpingham's precedence had been (though necessarily) given.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Erpingham led her to her place, a buzz of admiration and
      enthusiasm followed her steps. This pleased Erpingham more than, at that
      moment, it did Constance. Already intoxicated by her beauty, he was proud
      of the effect it produced on others, for that effect was a compliment to
      his taste. He exerted himself to be agreeable; nay, more, to be
      fascinating: he affected a low voice; and he attempted&mdash;poor man!&mdash;to
      flatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess of Winstoun and her daughter sat behind on an elevated bench.
      They saw with especial advantage the attentions with which one of the
      greatest of England's earls honoured the daughter of one of the greatest
      of England's orators. They were shocked at his want of dignity. Constance
      perceived their chagrin, and she lent a more pleased and attentive notice
      to Lord Erpingham's compliments: her eyes sparkled and her cheek blushed:
      and the good folks around, admiring Lord Erpingham's immense whiskers,
      thought Constance in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at this time that Percy Godolphin entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Godolphin's person was not of a showy order, there was something
      about him that always arrested attention. His air; his carriage; his long
      fair locks; his rich and foreign habits of dress, which his high bearing
      and intellectual countenance redeemed from coxcombry; all, united, gave
      something remarkable and distinguished to his appearance; and the interest
      attached to his fortunes, and to his social reputation for genius and
      eccentricity, could not fail of increasing the effect he produced when his
      name was known.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the throng of idlers that gathered around him; from the bows of the
      great and the smiles of the fair; Godolphin, however, directed his whole
      notice&mdash;his whole soul&mdash;to the spot which was hallowed by
      Constance Vernon. He saw her engaged with a man rich, powerful, and
      handsome. He saw that she listened to her partner with evident interest&mdash;that
      he addressed her with evident admiration. His heart sank within him; he
      felt faint and sick; then came anger&mdash;mortification; then agony and
      despair. All his former resolutions&mdash;all his prudence, his
      worldliness, his caution, vanished at once; he felt only that he loved,
      that he was supplanted, that he was undone. The dark and fierce passions
      of his youth, of a nature in reality wild and vehement, swept away at once
      the projects and the fabrics of that shallow and chill philosophy he had
      borrowed from the world, and deemed the wisdom of the closet. A cottage
      and a desert with Constance&mdash;Constance all his&mdash;heart and hand&mdash;would
      have been Paradise: he would have nursed no other ambition, nor dreamed of
      a reward beyond. Such effect has jealousy upon us. We confide, and we
      hesitate to accept a boon: we are jealous, and we would lay down life to
      attain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a handsome fellow Erpingham is!" said a young man in a cavalry
      regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin heard and groaned audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what a devilish handsome girl he is dancing with!" said another young
      man, from Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Vernon!&mdash;By Jove, Erpingham seems smitten. What a capital
      thing it would be for her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for him, too!" cried the more chivalrous Oxonian.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard," renewed the Oxonian, "that she was to be married to young
      Godolphin. He was staying here a short time ago. They rode and walked
      together. What a lucky fellow he has been. I don't know any one I should
      so much like to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said a third person, looking at Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy moved on. Accomplished and self-collected as he usually was, he
      could not wholly conceal the hell within. His brow grew knit and gloomy:
      he scarcely returned the salutations he received; and moving out of the
      crowd, he stole to a seat behind a large pillar, and, scarcely seen by any
      one, fixed his eyes on the form and movements of Miss Vernon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that he had placed himself in the vicinity of the Duchess
      of Winstoun, and within hearing of the conversation that I am about to
      record.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dance being over, Lord Erpingham led Constance to a seat close by Lady
      Margaret Midgecombe. The duchess had formed her plan of attack; and,
      rising as she saw Constance within reach, approached her with an air that
      affected civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, Miss Vernon? I am happy to see you looking so well. What
      truth in the report, eh?" And the duchess showed her teeth&mdash;videlicet,
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What report does your grace allude to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay; I am sure Lord Erpingham has heard it as well as myself; and I
      wish for your sake (a slight emphasis), indeed, for both your sakes, that
      it may be true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To wait till the Duchess of Winstoun speaks intelligibly would be a waste
      of her time and my own," said the haughty Constance, with the rudeness in
      which she then delighted, and for which she has since become known. Rut
      the duchess was not to be offended until she had completed her manoeuvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now," said she, turning to Lord Erpingham, "I appeal to you; is not
      Miss Vernon to be married very soon to Mr. Godolphin? I am sure (with an
      affected good-nature and compassion that stung Constance to the quick), I
      am sure I <i>hope</i> so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word you amaze me," said Lord Erpingham, opening to their fullest
      extent the large, round, hazel eyes for which he was so justly celebrated.
      "I never heard this before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! a secret as yet?" said the duchess; "very well! I can keep a secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Margaret looked down, and laughed prettily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought till now," said Constance, with grave composure, "that no
      person could be more contemptible than one who collects idle reports: I
      now find I was wrong: a person infinitely more contemptible is one who
      invents them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rude duchess beat at her own weapons, blushed with anger even through
      her rouge: but Constance turned away, and, still leaning on Lord
      Erpingham's arm, sought another seat;&mdash;that seat, on the opposite
      side of the pillar behind which Godolphin sat, was still within his
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, Miss Vernon," said Erpingham, "I admire your spirit.
      Nothing like setting down those absurd people who try to tease one, and
      think one dares not retort. But pray&mdash;I hope I'm not impertinent&mdash;pray,
      may I ask if this rumour have any truth in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," said Constance, with great effort, but in a clear tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: I should have thought not&mdash;I should have thought not.
      Godolphin's much too poor&mdash;much too poor for you. Miss Vernon is not
      born to marry for love in a cottage,&mdash;is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That soft, low tone thrilled to Godolphin's very heart. He bent forward:
      he held his breath: he thirsted for her voice; for some tone, some word in
      answer; it came not at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember," renewed the earl,&mdash;"you remember Miss L&mdash;&mdash;?
      no: she was before your time. Well! she married S&mdash;&mdash;, much such
      another fellow as Godolphin. He had not a shilling: but he lived well: had
      a house in Mayfair; gave dinners; hunted at Melton, and so forth: in
      short, he played high. She had about ten thousand pounds. They married,
      and lived for two years so comfortably, you have no idea. Every one envied
      them. They did not keep a close carriage, but he used to drive her out to
      dinners in his French cabriolet.(1) There was no show&mdash;no pomp:
      everything deuced neat, though; quite love in a cottage&mdash;only the
      cottage was in Curzon Street. At length, however, the cards turned; S&mdash;&mdash;
      lost everything; owed more than he could ever pay: we were forced to cut
      him; and his relation, Lord &mdash;&mdash;, coming into the ministry a
      year afterwards, got him a place in the Customs. They live at Brompton: he
      wears a pepper-and-salt coat, and she a mob-cap, with pink ribands: they
      have five hundred a year, and ten children. Such was the fate of S&mdash;&mdash;'s
      wife; such may be the fate of Godolphin's. Oh, Miss Vernon could not marry
      <i>him!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, Lord Erpingham," said Constance with emphasis; "but you
      take too much licence in expressing your opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Lord Erpingham could stammer forth his apology they heard a slight
      noise behind: they turned; Godolphin had risen. His countenance, always
      inclined to a calm severity&mdash;for thought is usually severe in its
      outward aspect&mdash;bent now on both the speakers with so dark and
      menacing an aspect that the stout earl felt his heart stand still for a
      moment; and Constance was appalled as if it had been the apparition, and
      not the living form, of her lover that she beheld. But scarcely had they
      seen this expression of countenance ere it changed. With a cold and
      polished smile, a relaxed brow and profound inclination of his form
      Godolphin greeted the two: and passing from his seat with a slow step
      glided among the crowd and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a strange thing, after all, is a great assembly! An immense mob of
      persons, who feel for each other the profoundest indifference&mdash;met
      together to join in amusements which the large majority of them consider
      wearisome beyond conception. How unintellectual, how uncivilised, such a
      scene, and such actors! What a remnant of barbarous times, when people
      danced because they had nothing to say! Were there nothing ridiculous in
      dancing, there would be nothing ridiculous in seeing wise men dance. But
      that sight would be ludicrous because of the disparity between the mind
      and the occupation. However, we have some excuse; we go to these
      assemblies to sell our daughters, or flirt with our neighbours' wives. A
      ballroom is nothing more or less than a great market-place of beauty. For
      my part, were I a buyer, I should like making my purchases in a less
      public mart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Godolphin, a glass of champagne," cried the young Lord Belvoir, as
      they sat near each other at the splendid supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart; but not from that bottle! We must have a new one; for
      this glass is pledged to Lady Delmour, and I would not drink to her health
      but from the first sparkle! Nothing tame, nothing insipid, nothing that
      has lost its first freshness, can be dedicated to one so beautiful and
      young."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fresh bottle was opened, and Godolphin bowed over his glass to Lord
      Belvoir's sister-a Beauty and a Blue. Lady Delmour admired Godolphin, and
      she was flattered by a compliment that no one wholly educated in England
      would have had the gallant courage to utter across a crowded table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been dancing?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?" said Godolphin. "Ah, Lady Delmour, do not ask." The look that
      accompanied the word, supplied them with a meaning. "Need I add," said he,
      in a lower voice, "that I have been thinking of the most beautiful person
      present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh," said Lady Delmour, turning away her head. Now, that <i>pooh</i> is
      a very significant word. On the lips of a man of business, it denotes
      contempt for romance; on the lips of a politician it rebukes a theory.
      With that monosyllable, a philosopher massacres a fallacy: by those four
      letters a rich man gets rid of a beggar. But in the rosy mouth of a woman
      the harshness vanishes, the disdain becomes encouragement. "Pooh!" says
      the lady when you tell her she is handsome; but she smiles when she says
      it. With the same reply she receives your protestation of love, and
      blushes as she receives. With men it is the sternest, with women the
      softest, exclamation in the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pooh!" said Lady Delmour, turning away her head:&mdash;and Godolphin was
      in singular spirits. What a strange thing that we should call such
      hilarity from our gloom! The stroke induces the flash; excite the nerves
      by jealousy, by despair, and with the proud you only trace the excitement
      by the mad mirth and hysterical laughter it creates. Godolphin was
      charming comme un amour, and the young countess was delighted with his
      gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever love?" asked she, tenderly, as they sat alone after supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, yes!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How often?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read Marmontel's story of the Four Phials: I have no other answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what a beautiful tale that is! The whole history of a man's heart is
      contained in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Godolphin was thus talking with Lady Delmour, his whole soul was
      with Constance; of her only he thought, and on her he thirsted for
      revenge. There is a curious phenomenon in love, showing how much vanity
      has to do with even the best species of it; when, for your mistress to
      prefer another, changes all your affection into hatred:&mdash;is it the
      loss of the mistress, or her preference to the other? The last, to be
      sure: for if the former, you would only grieve&mdash;but jealousy does not
      make you grieve, it makes you enraged; it does not sadden, it stings.
      After all, as we grow old, and look back on the "master passion," how we
      smile at the fools it made of us&mdash;at the importance we attach to it&mdash;of
      the millions that have been governed by it! When we examine the passion of
      love, it is like examining the character of some great roan; we are
      astonished to perceive the littlenesses that belong to it. We ask in
      wonder, "How come such effects from such a cause?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin continued talking sentiment with Lady Delmour, until her lord,
      who was very fond of his carriage horses, came up and took her away; and
      then, perhaps glad to be relieved, Percy sauntered into the ballroom,
      where, though the crowd was somewhat thinned, the dance was continued with
      that spirit which always seems to increase as the night advances.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own part, I now and then look late in at a ball as a warning and
      grave memento of the flight of time. No amusement belongs of right so
      essentially to the young, in their first youth,&mdash;to the unthinking,
      the intoxicated,&mdash;to those whose blood is an elixir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Constance be woman," said Godolphin to himself, as he returned to the
      ballroom, "I will yet humble her to my will. I have not learned the
      science so long, to be now foiled in the first moment I have seriously
      wished to triumph."
    </p>
    <p>
      As this thought inspired and excited him, he moved along at some distance
      from, but carefully within the sight of Constance. He paused by Lady
      Margaret Midgecombe. He addressed her. Notwithstanding the insolence and
      the ignorance of the Duchess of Winstoun, he was well received by both
      mother and daughter. Some persons there are, in all times and in all
      spheres, who command a certain respect, bought neither by riches, rank,
      nor even scrupulous morality of conduct. They win it by the reputation
      that talent alone can win them, and which yet is not always the reputation
      of talent. No man, even in the frivolous societies of the great, obtains
      homage without certain qualities, which, had they been happily directed,
      would have conducted him to fame. Had the attention of a Grammont, or of a
      &mdash;&mdash;, been early turned towards what ought to be the objects
      desired, who can doubt that, instead of the heroes of a circle, they might
      have been worthy of becoming names of posterity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the genius of Godolphin had drawn around him an eclat which made even
      the haughtiest willing to receive and to repay his notice; and Lady
      Margaret actually blushed with pleasure when he asked her to dance. A
      foreign dance, then only very partially known in England, had been called
      for: few were acquainted with it,&mdash;those only who had been abroad;
      and as the movements seemed to require peculiar grace of person, some even
      among those few declined, through modesty, the exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this dance Godolphin led Lady Margaret. All crowded round to see the
      performers; and, as each went through the giddy and intoxicating maze,
      they made remarks on the awkwardness or the singularity, or the
      impropriety of the dance. But when Godolphin began, the murmurs changed.
      The slow and stately measure then adapted to the steps, was one in which
      the graceful symmetry of his person might eminently display itself. Lady
      Margaret was at least as well acquainted with the dance: and the couple
      altogether so immeasurably excelled all competitors, that the rest, as if
      sensible of it, stopped one after the other; and when Godolphin,
      perceiving that they were alone, stopped also, the spectators made their
      approbation more audible than approbation usually is in polished society.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Godolphin paused, his eyes met those of Constance. There was not there
      the expression he had anticipated there was neither the anger of jealousy,
      nor the restlessness of offended vanity, nor the desire of conciliation,
      visible in those large and speaking orbs. A deep, a penetrating, a sad
      inquiry seemed to dwell in her gaze,&mdash;seemed anxious to pierce into
      his heart, and to discover whether there she possessed the power to wound,
      or whether each had been deceived: so at least seemed that fixed and
      melancholy intenseness of look to Godolphin. He left Lady Margaret
      abruptly: in an instant he was by the side of Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be delighted with this evening," said he, bitterly: "wherever I
      go I hear your praises: every one admires you; and he who does not admire
      so much as worship you, <i>he</i> alone is beneath your notice. He&mdash;born
      to such shattered fortunes,&mdash;he indeed might never <i>aspire</i> to
      that which titled and wealthy idiots deem they may <i>command,</i>&mdash;the
      hand of Constance Vernon."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a low and calm tone that Godolphin spoke. Constance turned
      deadly pale: her frame trembled; but she did not answer immediately. She
      moved to a seat retired a little from the busy crowd; Godolphin followed
      and sat himself beside her; and then, with a slight effort, Constance
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard what was said, Mr. Godolphin, and I grieve to think you did. If
      I offended you, however, forgive me, I pray you; I pray sincerely&mdash;warmly.
      God knows I have suffered myself enough from idle words, and from the
      slighting opinion with which this hard world visits the poor, not to feel
      deep regret and shame if I wound, by like means, another, more especially"&mdash;Constance's
      voice trembled,&mdash;"more especially <i>you!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she turned her eyes on Godolphin, and they were full of
      tears. The tenderness of her voice, her look, melted him at once. Was it
      to him, indeed, that the haughty Constance addressed the words of kindness
      and apology?&mdash;to him whose intrinsic circumstances she had heard
      described as so unworthy of her, and, his reason told him, with such
      justice?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Miss Vernon!" said he, passionately; "Miss Vernon&mdash;Constance&mdash;dear,
      dear Constance! dare I call you so? hear me one word. I love you with a
      love which leaves me no words to tell it. I know my faults, my poverty, my
      unworthiness; but&mdash;but&mdash;may I&mdash;may I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the woman was in Constance's cheek, as she listened. That cheek,
      how richly was it dyed! Her eyes drooped; her bosom heaved. How every word
      in those broken sentences sank into her heart! never was a tone forgotten.
      The child may forget its mother, and the mother desert the child: but
      never, never from a woman's heart departs the memory of the first
      confession of love from him whom she first loves! She lifted her eyes, and
      again withdrew them, and again gazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This must not be," at last she said; "no, no! it is folly, madness in
      both!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so; nay, not so!" whispered Godolphin, in the softest notes of a
      voice that could never be harsh. "It may seem folly&mdash;madness if you
      will, that the brilliant and all-idolized Miss Vernon should listen to the
      vows of so lowly an adorer: but try me&mdash;prove me, and own&mdash;yes,
      you <i>will</i> own some years hence, that that folly has been happy
      beyond the happiness of prudence or ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This!" answered Constance, struggling with her emotions; "this is no spot
      or hour for such a conference. Let us meet to-morrow&mdash;the western
      chamber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the hour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twelve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I may hope&mdash;till then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance again grew pale; and in a voice that, though it scarcely left
      her lips, struck coldness and dismay into his sudden and delighted
      confidence, answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Percy, there is no hope!&mdash;none!"
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) Then uncommon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE INTERVIEW.&mdash;THE CRISIS OF A LIFE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The western chamber was that I have mentioned as the one in which
      Constance usually fixed her retreat, when neither sociability nor state
      summoned her to the more public apartments. I should have said that
      Godolphin slept in the house; for, coming from a distance and through
      country roads, Lady Erpingham had proffered him that hospitality, and he
      had willingly accepted it. Before the appointed hour, he was at the
      appointed spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had passed the hours till then without even seeking his pillow. In
      restless strides across his chamber, he had revolved those words with
      which Constance had seemed to deny the hopes she herself had created. All
      private and more selfish schemes or reflections had vanished, as by magic,
      from the mind of a man prematurely formed, but not yet wholly hardened in
      the mould of worldly speculation. He thought no more of what he should
      relinquish in obtaining her hand; with the ardour of boyish and real love,
      he thought only of her. It was as if there existed no world but the little
      spot in which she breathed and moved. Poverty, privation, toil, the change
      of the manners and habits of his whole previous life, to those of
      professional enterprise and self-denial;&mdash;to all this he looked
      forward, not so much with calmness as with triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be but Constance mine!" said he again and again; and again and again
      those fatal words knocked at his heart, "No hope&mdash;none!" and he
      gnashed his teeth in very anguish, and muttered, "But mine she will not&mdash;she
      will never be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, before the hour of noon, something of his habitual
      confidence returned to him. He had succeeded, though but partially, in
      reasoning away the obvious meaning of the words; and he ascended to the
      chamber from the gardens, in which he had sought, by the air, to cool his
      mental fever, with a sentiment, ominous and doubtful indeed, but still
      removed from despondency and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was sad and heavy. A low, drizzling rain, and labouring yet
      settled clouds, which denied all glimpse of the sky, and seemed cursed
      into stagnancy by the absence of all wind or even breeze, increased by
      those associations we endeavour in vain to resist, the dark and oppressive
      sadness of his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused as he laid his hand on the door of the chamber: he listened; and
      in the acute and painful life which seemed breathed into all his senses,
      he felt as if he could have heard,&mdash;though without the room,&mdash;the
      very breath of Constance; or known, as by an inspiration, the presence of
      her beauty. He opened the door gently; all was silence and desolation for
      him&mdash;Constance was not there!
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt, however, as if that absence was a relief. He breathed more
      freely, and seemed to himself more prepared for the meeting. He took his
      station by the recess of the window: in vain&mdash;he could rest in no
      spot: he walked to and fro, pausing only for a moment as some object
      before him reminded him of past and more tranquil hours. The books he had
      admired and which, at his departure, had been left in their usual
      receptacle at another part of the house, he now discovered on the tables:
      they opened of themselves at the passages he had read aloud to Constance:
      those pages, in his presence, she had not seemed to admire; he was
      inexpressibly touched to perceive that, in his absence, they had become
      dear to her. As he turned with a beating heart from this silent proof of
      affection, he was startled by the sudden and almost living resemblance to
      Constance, which struck upon him in a full-length picture opposite&mdash;the
      picture of her father. That picture, by one of the best of our great
      modern masters of the art, had been taken of Vernon in the proudest epoch
      of his prosperity and fame. He was portrayed in the attitude in which he
      had uttered one of the most striking sentences of one of his most
      brilliant orations: the hand was raised, the foot advanced, the chest
      expanded. Life, energy, command, flashed from the dark eye, breathed from
      the dilated nostril, broke from the inspired lip. That noble brow&mdash;those
      modelled features&mdash;that air, so full of the royalty of genius&mdash;how
      startlingly did they resemble the softer lineaments of Constance!
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrested, in spite of himself, by the skill of the limner, and the
      characteristic of the portrait Godolphin stood, motionless and gazing,
      till the door opened, and Constance herself stood before him. She smiled
      faintly, but with sweetness as she approached; and seating herself,
      motioned him to a chair at a little distance. He obeyed the gesture in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Godolphin!" said she, softly. At the sound of her voice he raised his
      eyes from the ground, and fixed them on her countenance with a look so
      full of an imploring and earnest meaning, so expressive of the passion,
      the suspense of his heart, that Constance felt her voice cease at once.
      But he saw as he gazed how powerful had been his influence. Not a vestige
      of bloom was on her cheek: her very lips were colourless: her eyes were
      swollen with weeping; and though she seemed very calm and self-possessed,
      all her wonted majesty of mien was gone. The form seemed to shrink within
      itself. Humbleness and sorrow&mdash;deep, passionate, but quiet sorrow&mdash;had
      supplanted the haughtiness and the elastic freshness of her beauty. "Mr.
      Godolphin," she repeated, after a pause, "answer me truly and with
      candour; not with the world's gallantry, but with a sincere, a plain
      avowal. Were you not&mdash;in your unguarded expressions last night&mdash;were
      you not excited by the surprise, the passion, of the moment? Were you not
      uttering what, had you been actuated only by a calm and premeditated
      prudence, you would at least have suppressed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Vernon," replied Godolphin, "all that I said last night, I now, in
      calmness, and with deliberate premeditation, repeat: all that I can dream
      of happiness is in your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would, indeed, that I could disbelieve you," said Constance,
      sorrowfully; "I have considered deeply on your words. I am touched&mdash;made
      grateful&mdash;proud&mdash;yes, truly proud&mdash;by your confessed
      affection&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Constance!" cried Godolphin; in a sudden and agonized voice&mdash;and
      rising, he flung himself impetuously at her feet&mdash;"Constance! do not
      reject me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized her hand: it struggled not with his. He gazed on her
      countenance: it was dyed in blushes; and before those blushes vanished,
      her agitation found relief in tears, which flowed fast and full.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beloved!" said Godolphin, with a solemn tenderness, "why struggle with
      your heart? That heart I read at this moment: <i>that</i> is not averse to
      me." Constance wept on. "I know what you would say, and what you feel,"
      continued Godolphin: "you think that I&mdash;that we both are poor: that
      you could ill bear the humiliations of that haughty poverty which those
      born to higher fortunes so irksomely endure. You tremble to link your fate
      with one who has been imprudent&mdash;lavish&mdash;selfish, if you will.
      You recoil before you intrust your happiness to a man who, if he wreck
      that, can offer you nothing in return: no rank&mdash;no station&mdash;nothing
      to heal a bruised heart, or cover its wound, at least, in the rich
      disguises of power and wealth. Am I not right, Constance? Do I not read
      your mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Constance with energy. "Had I been born any man's daughter, but
      his from whom I take my name; were I the same in all things, mind and
      heart, save in one feeling, one remembrance, one object&mdash;that I am
      now; Heaven is my witness that I would not cast a thought upon poverty&mdash;upon
      privation: that I would&mdash;nay, I do&mdash;I do confide in your vows,
      your affection. If you have erred, I know it not. If any but you tell me
      you have erred, I believe them not. You I trust wholly and implicitly.
      Heaven, I say, is my witness that, did I obey the voice of my selfish
      heart, I would gladly, proudly, share and follow your fortunes. You
      mistake me if you think sordid and vulgar ambition can only influence me.
      No! I could be worthy of you! The daughter of John Vernon could be a
      worthy wife to the man of indigence and genius. In your poverty I could
      soothe you; in your labour I could support you; in your reverses console,
      in your prosperity triumph. But&mdash;but, it must not be. Go, Godolphin&mdash;dear
      Godolphin! There are thousands better and fairer than I am, who will do
      for you as I would have done; but who possess the power I have not&mdash;who,
      instead of sharing, can raise your fortunes. Go!&mdash;and if it comfort,
      if it soothe you, believe that I have not been insensible to your
      generosity, your love. My best wishes, my fondest prayers, my dearest
      hopes, are yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinded by her tears, subdued by her emotions, Constance was still
      herself. She rose; she extricated her hand from Godolphin's; she turned to
      leave the room. But Godolphin, still kneeling, caught hold of her robe,
      and gently, but effectually detained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The picture you have painted," said he, "do not destroy at once. You have
      portrayed yourself my soother, guide, restorer. You <i>can,</i> indeed you
      can, be this. You do not know me, Constance. Let me say one word for my
      self. Hitherto, I have shunned fame and avoided ambition. Life has seemed
      to me so short, and all that even glory wins so poor, that I have thought
      no labour worth the price of a single hour of pleasure and enjoyment. For
      you, how joyfully will I renounce my code! For myself I could ask no
      honour: for you, I will labour for all. No toil shall be dry to me&mdash;no
      pleasure shall decoy. I will renounce my idle and desultory pursuits. I
      will enter the great public arena, where all who come armed with patience
      and with energy are sure to win. Constance, I am not without talents,
      though they have slept within me; say but the word, and you know not what
      they can produce."
    </p>
    <p>
      An irresolution in Constance was felt as a sympathy by Godolphin; he
      continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are both desolate in the world, Constance; we are orphans&mdash;friendless,
      fortuneless. Yet both have made our way without friends, and commanded our
      associates, though without fortune. Does not this declare we have that
      within us which, when we are united, can still exalt or conquer our
      destiny? And we&mdash;we&mdash;alone in the noisy and contentious world
      with which we strive&mdash;we shall turn, after each effort, to our own
      hearts, and find there a comfort and a shelter. All things will bind us
      closer and closer to each other. The thought of our past solitude, the
      hope of our future objects, will only feed the fountain of our present
      love. And how much sweeter, Constance, will be honours to you, if we thus
      win them; sanctified as they will be by the sacrifices we have made; by
      the thought of the many hours in which we desponded, yet took consolation
      from each other; by the thought how we sweetened mortifications by
      sympathy, and made even the lowest successes noble by the endearing
      associations with which we allied them! How much sweeter to you will be
      such honours than those which you might command at once, but accompanied
      by a cold heart; rendered wearisome because won with ease and low because
      undignified by fame! Oh, Constance! am I not heard? Have not love, nature,
      sense, triumphed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he had risen gently, and wound his arms around her not
      reluctant form: her head reclined upon his bosom; her hand was surrendered
      to his; and his kiss stole softly and unchidden to her cheek. At that
      instant, the fate of both hung on a very hair. How different might the
      lot, the character, of each have been, had Constance's lips pronounced the
      words that her heart already recorded! And she might have done so; but as
      she raised her eyes, the same object that had before affected Godolphin
      came vividly upon her, and changed, as by an electric shock, the whole
      current of her thoughts. Full and immediately before her was the picture
      of her father. The attitude there delineated, so striking at all times,
      seemed to Constance at that moment more than ever impressive, and even
      awful in the <i>livingness</i> of its command. It was the face of Vernon
      in the act of speech&mdash;of warning&mdash;of reproof; such as she had
      seen it often in private life; such as she had seen it in his bitter
      maledictions on his hollow friends at the close of his existence: nay,
      such as she had seen it,&mdash;only more fearful, and ghastly with the
      hues of death,&mdash;in his last hours; in those hours in which he had
      pledged her to the performance of his revenge, and bade her live not for
      love but the memory of her sire.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the sight of the face rushed upon her the dark and solemn
      recollections of that time and of that vow. The weakness of love vanished
      before the returning force of a sentiment nursed through her earliest
      years, fed by her dreams, strengthened by her studies, and hardened by the
      daring energies of a nature lofty yet fanatical, into the rule, the end,
      nay, the very religion of life! She tore herself away from the surprised
      and dismayed Godolphin; she threw herself on her knees before the picture;
      her lips moved rapidly; the rapid and brief prayer for forgiveness was
      over, and Constance rose a new being. She turned to Godolphin, and,
      lifting her arm towards the picture, as she regarded, with her bright and
      kindling eyes, the face of her lover; she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you think now, thought he whose voice speaks to you from the canvas;
      he, who pursued the path that you would tread; who, through the same toil,
      the same pursuit, that you would endure, used the same powers and the same
      genius you would command; he, who won,&mdash;what you might win also at
      last,&mdash;the smile of princes, the trust of nobles, the shifting and
      sandy elevation which the best, the wisest, and greatest statesmen in this
      country, if unbacked by a sordid and caballing faction, can alone obtain;&mdash;he
      warns you from that hollow distinction,&mdash;from its wretched
      consummation. Oh, Godolphin!" she continued, subdued, and sinking from a
      high-wrought but momentary paroxysm, uncommon to her collected character,
      "Oh, Godolphin! I saw that man dying, deserted, lonely, cursed by his
      genius, ruined by his prosperity. I saw him dying,&mdash;die,&mdash;of a
      broken and trampled heart. Could I doom another victim to the same course,
      and the same perfidy, and the same fate? Could I, with a silent heart,
      watch by that victim; could I, viewing his certain doom, elate him with
      false hopes?&mdash;No, no! fly from me,&mdash;from the thought of such a
      destiny. Marry one who can bring you wealth, and support you with rank; <i>then</i>
      be ambitious if you will. Leave me to fulfil my doom,&mdash;my vow; and to
      think, however wretched I may be, that I have not inflicted a permanent
      wretchedness on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin sprang forward; but the door closed upon his eyes; and he saw
      Constance&mdash;as Constance <i>Vernon</i>&mdash;no more.

      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A RARE AND EXQUISITE OF THE BEST (WORST) SCHOOL.&mdash;A CONVERSATION ON A
      THOUSAND MATTERS.&mdash;THE DECLENSION OF THE "SUI PROFUSUS" INTO THE
      "ALIENI APPETENS."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, in the day I now refer to, a certain house in Chesterfield
      Street, Mayfair, which few young men anxious for the eclat of society
      passed without a wish for the acquaintance of the inmate. To that small
      and dingy mansion, with its verandahs of dusky green, and its blinds
      perpetually drawn, there attached an interest, a consideration, and a
      mystery. Thither, at the dusk of night, were the hired carriages of
      intrigue wont to repair, and dames to alight, careful seemingly of
      concealment, yet wanting, perhaps, even a reputation to conceal. Few, at
      the early hours of morn, passed that street on their way home from some
      glittering revel without noticing some three or four chariots in waiting;&mdash;or
      without hearing from within the walls the sounds of protracted festivity.
      That house was the residence of a man who had never done anything in
      public, and yet was the most noted personage in Society in early life, the
      all-accomplished Lovelace! in later years mingling the graces with the
      decayed heart and the want of principle of a Grammont. Feared, contemned,
      loved, hated, ridiculed, honoured, the very genius, the very
      personification, of a civilized and profligate life seemed embodied in
      Augustus Saville. Hitherto we have spoken of, let us now describe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born to the poor fortunes and equivocal station of cadet in a noble but
      impoverished house, he had passed his existence in a round of lavish, but
      never inelegant, dissipation. Unlike other men, whom youth, and money, and
      the flush of health, and aristocratic indulgence, allure to follies, which
      shock the taste as well as the morality of the wise, Augustus Saville had
      never committed an error which was not varnished by grace, and limited by
      a profound and worldly discretion. A systematic votary of pleasure&mdash;no
      woman had ever through him lost her reputation or her sphere; whether it
      was that he corrupted into fortunate dissimulation the minds that he
      betrayed into guilt, or whether he chose his victims with so just a
      knowledge of their characters, and of the circumstances round them, that
      he might be sure the secrecy maintained by himself would scarcely be
      divulged elsewhere. All the world attributed to Augustus Saville the most
      various and consummate success in that quarter in which success is most
      envied by the lighter part of the world: yet no one could say exactly who,
      amongst the many he addressed, had been the object of his triumph. The
      same quiet, and yet victorious discretion waited upon all he did. Never
      had he stooped to win celebrity from horses or from carriages; nothing in
      his equipages showed the ambition to be distinguished from another; least
      of all did he affect that most displeasing of minor ostentatious, that
      offensive exaggeration of neatness, that outer simplicity, which our young
      nobles and aspiring bankers so ridiculously think it bon ton to assume. No
      harness, industriously avoiding brass; no liveries, pretending to the
      tranquillity of a gentleman's dress; no panels, disdaining the armorial
      attributes of which real dignity should neither be ashamed nor proud&mdash;converted
      plain taste into a display of plainness. He seldom appeared at races, and
      never hunted; though he was profound master of the calculations in the
      first, and was, as regarded the second, allowed to be one of the most
      perfect masters of horsemanship in his time. So, in his chess, while he
      chose even sedulously what became him most, he avoided the appearance of
      coxcombry, by a disregard to minutiae. He did not value himself on the
      perfection of his boot; and suffered a wrinkle in his coat without a sigh:
      yet, even the exquisites of the time allowed that no one was more
      gentlemanlike in the tout ensemble; and while he sought by other means
      than dress to attract, he never even in dress offended. Carefully shunning
      the character of the professed wit, or the general talker, he was yet
      piquant, shrewd, and animated to the few persons whom he addressed, or
      with whom he associated: and though he had refused all offers to enter
      public life, he was sufficiently master of the graver subjects that
      agitated the times to impress even those practically engaged in them with
      a belief in his information and his talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was born poor; and yet he had lived for nearly thirty years as a
      rich man! What was his secret?&mdash;he had lived upon others. At all
      games of science, he played with a masterly skill; and in those wherein
      luck preponderates, there are always chances for a cool and systematic
      calculation. He had been, indeed, suspected of unfair play; but the charge
      had never cooled the eagerness with which he had been courted. With far
      better taste, and in far higher estimation than Brummell, he obtained an
      equal, though a more secret sway. Every one was desirous to know him:
      without his acquaintance, the young debutant felt that he wanted the
      qualification to social success: by his intimacy, even vulgarity became
      the rage. It was true that, as no woman's disgrace was confessedly traced
      to him, so neither was any man's ruin&mdash;save only in the doubtful
      instance of the unfortunate Johnstone. He never won of any person, however
      ardent, more than a certain portion of his fortune&mdash;the rest of his
      undoing Saville left to his satellites; nay, even those who had in reality
      most reason to complain of him, never perceived his due share in their
      impoverishment. It was common enough to hear men say, "Ah! Saville, I wish
      I had taken your advice, and left off while I had yet half my fortune!"
      They did not accurately heed that the first half was Saville's; because
      the first half had excited, not ruined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this method of making money, so strictly social, Saville had also
      applied his keen intellect and shrewd sense to other speculations. Cheap
      houses, cheap horses, fluctuations in the funds, all descriptions of
      property (except perhaps stolen goods), had passed under his earnest
      attention; and in most cases, such speculations had eminently succeeded.
      He was therefore now, in his middle age, and still unmarried, a man
      decidedly wealthy; having, without ever playing miser, without ever
      stinting a luxury, or denying a wish, turned nothing into something,
      poverty into opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was noon; and Saville was slowly finishing his morning repast, and
      conversing with a young man stretched on a sofa opposite in a listless
      attitude. The room was in perfect keeping with the owner: there was
      neither velvet, nor gilding, nor buhl, nor marquetrie&mdash;all of which
      would have been inconsistent with the moderate size of the apartment. But
      the furniture was new, massive, costly, and luxurious without the
      ostentation of luxury. A few good pictures, and several exquisite busts
      and figures in bronze, upon marble pedestals, gave something classic and
      graceful to the aspect of the room. Annexed to the back drawing-room,
      looking over Lord Chesterfield's gardens, a small conservatory, filled
      with rich exotics, made the only feature in the apartment that might have
      seemed, to a fastidious person, effeminate or unduly voluptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saville himself was about forty-seven years of age: of a person slight and
      thin, without being emaciated: a not ungraceful, though habitual stoop,
      diminished his height, which might be a little above the ordinary
      standard. In his youth he had been handsome; but in his person there was
      now little trace of any attraction beyond that of a manner remarkably soft
      and insinuating: yet in his narrow though high forehead&mdash;his sharp
      aquiline nose, grey eye, and slightly sarcastic curve of lip, something of
      his character betrayed itself. You saw, or fancied you saw in them the
      shrewdness, the delicacy of tact; the consciousness of duping others; the
      subtle and intuitive, yet bland and noiseless penetration into the
      characters around him, which made the prominent features of his mind. And,
      indeed, of all qualities, dissimulation is that which betrays itself the
      most often in the physiognomy. A fortunate thing, that the long habit of
      betraying should find at times the index in which to betray itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't tell me, my dear Godolphin," said Saville, as he broke the
      toast into his chocolate,&mdash;"you don't tell me how the world employed
      itself at Rome. Were there any of the true calibre there? steady fellows,
      yet ardent, like myself?&mdash;men who make us feel our strength and put
      it forth&mdash;with whom we cannot dally nor idle&mdash;who require our
      coolness of head, clearness of memory, ingenuity of stratagem&mdash;in a
      word, men of my art&mdash;the art of play:&mdash;were there any such?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not many, but enough for honour," said Godolphin: "for myself, I have
      long forsworn gambling for profit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I always thought you wanted that perseverance which belongs to
      strength of character. And how stand your resources now? Sufficient to
      recommence the world here with credit and eclat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, were I so disposed, Saville. But I shall return to Italy. Within a
      month hence, I shall depart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! and only just arrived in town! An heir in possession!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reputation of having succeeded to a property, the extent of which, if
      wise, you will tell to no one! Are you so young, Godolphin, as to imagine
      that it signifies one crumb of this bread what be the rent-roll of your
      estate, so long as you can obtain credit for any sum to which you are
      pleased to extend it? Credit! beautiful invention!&mdash;the moral new
      world to which we fly when banished from the old. Credit!&mdash;the true
      charity of Providence, by which they who otherwise would starve live in
      plenty, and despise the indigent rich. Credit!&mdash;admirable system,
      alike for those who live on it and the wiser few who live by it. Will you
      borrow some money of me, Godolphin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At what percentage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, let me see: funds are low; I'll be moderate. But stay; be it with
      you as I did with George Sinclair. You shall have all you want, and pay me
      with a premium, when you marry an heiress. Why, roan, you wince at the
      word 'marry!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a sore subject, Saville: one that makes a man think of halters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right&mdash;I recognise my young pupil. Your old play-writers
      talked nonsense when they said men lost liberty of person by marriage. Men
      lose liberty, but it is the liberty of the mind. We cease to be
      independent of the world's word, when we grow respectable with a wife, a
      fat butler, two children, and a family coach. It makes a gentleman little
      better than a grocer or a king! But you have seen Constance Vernon. Why,
      out on this folly, Godolphin! You turn away. Do you fancy that I did not
      penetrate your weakness the moment you mentioned her name?&mdash;still
      less, do you fancy, my dear young friend, that I, who have lived through
      nearly half a century, and know our nature, and the whole thermometer of
      our blood, think one jot the worse of you for forming a caprice, or a
      passion, if you will&mdash;for a woman who would set an anchoret, or, what
      is still colder, a worn out debauchee, on fire? Bah! Godolphin, I am wiser
      than you take me for. And I will tell you more. For your sake, I am <i>happy</i>
      that you have incurred already this, our common folly (which we all have
      once in a life), and that the fit is over. I do not pry into your secrets;
      I know their delicacy, I do not ask which of you drew back; for, to have
      gone forward, to have married, would have been madness in both. Nay, it
      was an <i>impossibility</i>: it could not have happened to my pupil; the
      ablest, the subtlest, the wisest of my pupils. But, however it was broken
      off, I repeat that I am glad it happened. One is never sure of a man's
      wisdom, till he has been really and vainly in love. You know what that
      moralizing lump of absurdity, Lord Edouard, has said in the Julie&mdash;'the
      path of the passions conducts us to philosophy!' It is true, very true;
      and now that the path has been fairly trod, the goal is at hand. <i>Now,</i>
      I can confide in your steadiness; now, I can feel that you will run no
      chance in future, of over-appreciating that bauble, Woman. You will beg,
      borrow, steal, and exchange or lose the jewel, with the same delicious
      excitement, coupled with the same steady indifference, with which we play
      at a more scientific game, and for a more comprehensive reward. I say more
      comprehensive reward: for how many women may we be able to buy by a
      judicious bet on the odd trick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your turn is sudden," said Godolphin, smiling; "and there is some justice
      in your reasoning. The fit <i>is</i> over; and if ever I can be wise, I
      have entered on wisdom now. But talk of this no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not," said Saville, whose unerring tact had reached just the point
      where to stop, and who had led Godolphin through just that vein of
      conversation, half sentimentalising, half sensible, all profligate, which
      seldom fails to win the ear of a man both of imagination and of the world.
      "I will not; and, to vary the topic, I will turn egoist, and tell you <i>my</i>
      adventures."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, Saville began a light and amusing recital of his various and
      singular life for the last three years. Anecdote, jest, maxim, remark,
      interspersed, gave a zest and piquancy to the narration. An accomplished
      roue always affects to moralise; it is a part of his character. There is a
      vague and shrewd sentiment that pervades his morale and his system.
      Frequent excitement, and its attendant relaxation; the conviction of the
      folly of all pursuits; the insipidity of all life; the hollowness of all
      love; the faithlessness in all ties; the disbelief in all worth; these
      consequences of a dissipated existence on a thoughtful mind, produce some
      remarkable, while they make so many wretched, characters. They coloured
      some of the most attractive prose among the French, and the most
      fascinating verse in the pages of Byron. It might be asked, by a profane
      inquirer (and I have touched on this before), what effect a life nearly
      similar&mdash;a life of luxury, indolence, lassitude, profuse, but
      heartless love, imparted to the deep and touching wisdom in his page, whom
      we consider the wisest of men, and who has left us the most melancholy of
      doctrines?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this turn of mind that made Savill's conversation peculiarly
      agreeable to Godolphin in his present humour; and the latter invested it,
      from his own mood, with a charm which in reality it wanted. For, as I
      shall show, in Godolphin, what deterioration the habits of frivolous and
      worldly life produce on the mind of a man of genius, I show only in
      Saville the effect they produce on a man of sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Godolphin," said Saville, as he saw the former rise to depart; "you
      will at least dine with me to-day&mdash;a punctual eight. I think I can
      promise you an agreeable evening. The Linettini, and that dear little
      Fanny Millinger (your old flame), are coming; and I have asked old
      Stracey, the poet, to say bons mots for them. Poor old Stracey! He goes
      about to all his former friends and fellow-liberals, boasting of his
      favour with the Great, and does not see that we only use him as we would a
      puppet-show or a dancing-dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What folly," said Godolphin, "it is in any man of genius (not also of
      birth) to think the Great of this country can possibly esteem him! Nothing
      can equal the secret enmity with which dull men regard an intellect above
      their comprehension. Party politics, and the tact, the shifting, the
      commonplace that Party politics alone require; these they can appreciate;
      and they feel respect for an orator, even though he be not a county
      member; for he can assist them in their paltry ambition for place and
      pension: but an author, or a man of science, the rogues positively jeer at
      him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," said Saville, "how few men of letters perceive a truth so
      evident to us, so hackneyed even in the conversations of society! For a
      little reputation at a dinner table, for a coaxing nobe from some titled
      demirep affecting the De Stael, they forget not only to be glorious but
      even to be respectable. And this, too, not only for so petty a
      gratification, but for one that rarely lasts above a London season. We
      allow the low-born author to be the lion this year; but we dub him a bore
      the next. We shut our doors upon his twice-told jests, and send for the
      Prague minstrels to sing to us after dinner instead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "However," said Godolphin, "it is only poets you find so foolish as to be
      deceived by you. There is not a single prose writer of real genius so
      absurd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," replied Godolphin, philosophising, "poets address themselves
      more to women than men; and insensibly they acquire the weaknesses which
      they are accustomed to address. A poet whose verses delight the women will
      be found, if we closely analyse his character, to be very like a woman
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't love poets?" said Saville.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The glory of old has departed from them. I mean less from their pages
      than their minds. We have plenty of beautiful poets, but how little poetry
      breathing of a great soul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the door opened, and a Mr. Glosson was announced. There entered a
      little, smirking, neat-dressed man, prim as a lawyer or a house-agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Glosson, is that you?" said Saville, with something like animation:
      "sit down, my good sir,&mdash;sit down. Well! well! (rubbing his bands);
      what news? what news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mr. Saville, I think we may get the land from old &mdash;&mdash;. He
      has the right of the job. I have been with him all this morning. He asks
      six thousand pounds for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The unconscionable dog! He got it from the crown for two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, very true,&mdash;very true: but you don't see, sir,&mdash;you don't
      see, that it is well worth nine. Sad times,&mdash;sad times: jobs from the
      crown are growing scarcer every day, Mr. Saville."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! that's all a chance, a speculation. Times are bad indeed, as you
      say: no money in the market; go, Glosson; offer him five; your percentage
      shall be one per cent. higher than if I pay six thousand, and shall be
      counted up to the latter sum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He! he! he! sir!" grinned Glosson; "you are fond of your joke, Mr.
      Saville."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now; what else in the market? never mind my friend: Mr. Godolphin&mdash;Mr.
      Glosson; now all gene is over; proceed,&mdash;proceed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Glosson hummed, and bowed, and hummed again, and then glided on to speak
      of houses, and crown lands, and properties in Wales, and places at court
      (for some of the subordinate posts at the palace were then&mdash;perhaps
      are now&mdash;regular matter of barter); and Saville, bending over the
      table, with his thin delicate hands clasped intently, and his brow
      denoting his interest, and his sharp shrewd eye fixed on the agent,
      furnished to the contemplative Godolphin a picture which he did not fail
      to note, to moralise on, to despise!
    </p>
    <p>
      What a spectacle is that of the prodigal rake, hardening and sharpening
      into the grasping speculator!

      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FANNY MILLINGER ONCE MORE.&mdash;LOVE.&mdash;WOMAN.&mdash;BOOKS.&mdash;A
      HUNDRED TOPICS TOUCHED ON THE SURFACE.&mdash;GODOLPHIN'S STATE OF MIND
      MORE MINUTELY EXAMINED.&mdash;THE DINNER AT SAVILLE'S.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin went to see and converse with Fanny Millinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still unmarried, and still the fashion. There was a sort of
      allegory of real life, in the manner in which, at certain epochs, our
      Idealist was brought into contact with the fair actress of ideal
      creations. There was, in short, something of a moral in the way these two
      streams of existence&mdash;the one belonging to the Actual, the other to
      the Imaginary&mdash;flowed on, crossing each other at stated times. Which
      was the more really imaginative&mdash;the life of the stage, or that of
      the world's stage? The gay Fanny was rejoiced to welcome back again her
      early lover. She ran on, talking of a thousand topics, without remarking
      the absent mind and musing eye of Godolphin, till he himself stopped her
      somewhat abruptly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Fanny, well, and what do you know of Saville? You have grown
      intimate with him, eh? We shall meet at his house this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, he is a charming person in his little way; and the only man who
      allows me to be a friend without dreaming of becoming a lover. Now that's
      what I like. We poor actresses have so much would-be love in the course of
      our lives, that a little friendship now and then is a novelty which other
      and soberer people can never appreciate. On reading Gil Blas the other day&mdash;I
      am no great reader, as you may remember&mdash;I was struck by that part in
      which the dear Santillane assures us that there was never any love between
      him and Laura the actress. I thought it so true to nature, so probable,
      that they should have formed so strong an intimacy for each other, lived
      in the same house, had every opportunity for love, yet never loved. And it
      was exactly because she was an actress, and a light good-for-nothing
      creature that it so happened; the very multiplicity of lovers prevented
      her falling in love; the very carelessness of her life, poor girl,
      rendered a friend so charming to her. It would have spoiled the friend to
      have made him an adorer; it would have turned the rarity into the
      every-day character. Now, so it is with me and Saville; I like his wit, he
      likes my good temper. We see each other as often as if we were in love;
      and yet I do not believe it even possible that he should ever kiss my
      hand. After all," continued Fanny, laughing, "love is not so necessary to
      us women as people think. Fine writers say, 'Oh, men have a thousand
      objects, women but one!' That's nonsense, dear Percy; women have their
      thousand objects too. They have not the bar, but they have the milliner's
      shop; they can't fight, but they can sit by the window and embroider a
      work-bag; they don't rush into politics, but they plunge their souls into
      love for a parrot or a lap-dog. Don't let men flatter themselves;
      Providence has been just as kind in that respect to one sex as to the
      other; our objects are small, yours great; but a small object may occupy
      the mind just as much as the loftiest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ours great! pshaw!" said Godolphin, who was rather struck with Fanny's
      remarks; "there is nothing great in those professions which man is pleased
      to extol. Is selfishness great? Are the low trickery, the organised lies
      of the bar, a great calling? Is the mechanical slavery of the soldier&mdash;fighting
      because he is in the way of fighting, without knowing the cause, without
      an object, save a dim, foolish vanity which he calls glory, and cannot
      analyse&mdash;is that a great aim and vocation? Well: the senate! look at
      the outcry which wise men make against the loathsome corruption of that
      arena; then look at the dull hours,&mdash;the tedious talk, the empty
      boasts, the poor and flat rewards, and tell me where is the greatness? No,
      Fanny! the embroidered work-bag, and the petted parrot, afford just as
      great&mdash;morally great&mdash;occupations as those of the bar, the army,
      the senate. It is only the frivolous who talk of frivolities; there is
      nothing frivolous; all earthly occupations are on a par&mdash;alike
      important if they alike occupy; for to the wise all are poor and
      valueless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy you are very wrong," said the actress, pressing her pretty
      fingers to her forehead, as if to understand him; "but I cannot tell you
      why, and I never argue. I ramble on in my odd way, casting out my shrewd
      things without defending them if any one chooses to quarrel with them.
      What I do I let others do. My maxim in talk is my maxim in life. I claim
      liberty for myself, and give indulgence to others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Godolphin, "that you have plenty of books about you, though
      you plead not guilty to reading. Do you learn your philosophy from them?
      for I think you have contracted a vein of reflection since we parted which
      I scarcely recognise as an old characteristic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," answered Fanny, "though I don't read, I skim. Sometimes I canter
      through a dozen novels in a morning. I am disappointed, I confess, in all
      these works; I want to see more real knowledge of the world than they ever
      display. They tell us how Lord Arthur looked, and Lady Lucy dressed, and
      what was the colour of those curtains, and these eyes, and so forth; and
      then the better sort, perhaps, do also tell us what the heroine felt as
      well as wore, and try with might and main to pull some string of the
      internal machine; but still I am not enlightened, not touched. I don't
      recognise men and women; they are puppets with holiday phrases: and I tell
      you what, Percy, these novelists make the last mistake you would suppose
      them guilty of; they have not romance enough in them to paint the truths
      of society. Old gentlemen say novels are bad teachers of life, because
      they make it too ideal; quite the reverse: novels are too trite! too
      superficial! Their very talk about love, and the fuss they make about it,
      show how shallow real romance is with them; for they say nothing new on
      it, and real romance is for ever striking out new thoughts. Am I not
      right, Percy?&mdash;No! life, be it worldly as it may, has a vast deal of
      romance in it. Every one of us (even poor I) have a mine of thoughts, and
      fancies, and wishes, that books are too dull and commonplace to reach the
      heart is a romance in itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A philosophical romance, my Fanny; full of mysteries and conceits, and
      refinements, mixed up with its deeper passages. But how came you so wise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you!" answered Fanny, with a profound curtsey. "The fact is&mdash;though
      you, as in duty bound, don't perceive it&mdash;that I am older than I was
      when we last met. I reflect where I then felt. Besides, the stage fills
      our heads with a half sort of wisdom, and gives us that strange melange of
      shrewd experience and romantic notions which is, in fact, the real
      representation of nine human hearts out of ten. Talking of books, I want
      some one to write a novel, which shall be a metaphysical Gil Blas; which
      shall deal more with the mind than Le Sage's book, and less with the
      actions; which shall make its hero the creature of the world, but a
      different creation, though equally true; which shall give a faithful
      picture in the character of one man of the aspect and the effects of our
      social system; making that man of a better sort of clay than the amusing
      lacquey was, and the produce of a more artificial grade of society. The
      book I mean would be a sadder one than Le Sage's but equally faithful to
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it would have more of romance, if I rightly understand what you
      mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely: romance of idea as well as incident&mdash;natural romance. By
      the way, how few know what natural romance is: so that you feel the ideas
      in a book or play are true and faithful to the characters they are
      ascribed to, why mind whether the incidents are probable? Yet common
      readers only go by the incidents; as if the incidents in three-fourths of
      Shakspeare's plays were even ordinarily possible! But people have so
      little nature in them, that they don't know what is natural!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Fanny ran on, in no very connected manner; stringing together those
      remarks which, unless I am mistaken, show how much better an uneducated,
      clever girl, whose very nature is a quick perception of art, can play the
      critic, then the pedants who assume the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only for the moment that the heavy heart of Godolphin could
      forget its load. It was in vain that he sought to be amused while yet
      smarting under the freshness of regret. A great shock had been given to
      his nature; he had loved against his will; and as we have seen, on his
      return to the Priory, he had even resolved on curing himself of a passion
      so unprofitable and unwise. But the jealousy of a night had shivered into
      dust a prudence which never of right belonged to a very ardent and
      generous nature: that jealousy was soothed, allayed; but how fierce, how
      stunning was the blow that succeeded it! Constance had confessed love, and
      yet had refused him&mdash;for ever! Clear and noble as to herself her
      motives might seem in that refusal, it was impossible that they should
      appear in the same light to Godolphin. Unable to penetrate into the effect
      which her father's death-bed and her own oath had produced on the mind of
      Constance; how indissolubly that remembrance had united itself with all
      her schemes and prospects for the future; how marvellously, yet how
      naturally, it had converted worldly ambition into a sacred duty;&mdash;unable,
      I say, to comprehend all these various, and powerful, and governing
      motives, Godolphin beheld in her refusal only the aversion to share his
      slender income, and the desire for loftier station. He considered,
      therefore, that sorrow was a tribute to her unworthy of himself; he deemed
      it a part of his dignity to strive to forget. That hallowed sentiment
      which, in some losses of the heart, makes it a duty to remember, and
      preaches a soothing and soft lesson from the very text of regret, was not
      for the wrung and stricken soul of Godolphin. He only strove to dissipate
      his grief, and shut out from his mental sight the charmed vision of the
      first, the only woman he had deeply loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin felt, too, that the sole impulse which could have united the
      fast-expiring energy and enterprise of his youth to the ambition of life
      was for ever gone. With Constance&mdash;with the proud thoughts that
      belonged to her&mdash;the aspirings after earthly honours were linked, and
      with her were broken. He felt his old philosophy&mdash;the love of ease,
      the profound contempt for fame,&mdash;close, like the deep waters over
      those glittering hosts for whose passage they had been severed for a
      moment&mdash;whelming the crested and gorgeous visions for ever beneath
      the wave! Conscious of his talents&mdash;nay, swayed to and fro by the
      unquiet stirrings of no common genius&mdash;Godolphin yet foresaw that he
      was not henceforth destined to play a shining part in the crowded drama of
      life. His career was already closed; he might be contented, prosperous,
      happy, but never great. He had seen enough of authors, and of the thorns
      that beset the paths of literature, to experience none of those delusions
      which cheat the blinded aspirer into the wilderness of publication&mdash;that
      mode of obtaining fame and hatred to which those who feel unfitted for
      more bustling concerns are impelled. Write he might: and he was fond (as
      disappointment increased his propensities to dreaming) of brightening his
      solitude with the golden palaces and winged shapes that lie glassed within
      the fancy&mdash;the soul's fairy-land. But the vision with him was only
      evoked one hour to be destroyed the next. Happy had it been for Godolphin,
      and not unfortunate perhaps for the world, had he learned at that exact
      moment the true motive for human action which he afterwards, and too late,
      discovered. Happy had it been for him to have learned that there is an
      ambition to do good&mdash;an ambition to raise the wretched as well as to
      rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas!&mdash;either in letters or in politics, how utterly poor, barren,
      and untempting, is every path that points upward to the mockery of public
      eminence, when looked upon by a soul that has any real elements of wise or
      noble; unless we have an impulse within, which mortification chills not&mdash;a
      reward without, which selfish defeat does not destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, unblest by one friend really wise or good, spoilt by the world,
      soured by disappointment, Godolphin's very faculties made him inert, and
      his very wisdom taught him to be useless. Again and again&mdash;as the
      spider in some cell where no winged insect ever wanders, builds and
      rebuilds his mesh,&mdash;the scheming heart of the Idealist was doomed to
      weave net after net for those visions of the Lovely and the Perfect which
      can never descend to the gloomy regions wherein mortality is cast. The
      most common disease to genius is nympholepsy&mdash;the saddening for a
      spirit that the world knows not. Ah! how those outward disappointments
      which should cure, only feed the disease!
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner at Saville's was gay and lively, as such entertainments with
      such participators usually are. If nothing in the world is more heavy than
      your formal banquet,&mdash;nothing, on the other hand, is more agreeable
      than those well-chosen laissez aller feasts at which the guests are as
      happily selected as the wines; where there is no form, no reserve, no
      effort; and people having met to sit still for a few hours are willing to
      be as pleasant to each other as if they were never to meet again. Yet the
      conversation in all companies not literary turns upon persons rather than
      things; and your wits learn their art only in the School for Scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only think, Fanny," said Saville, "of Clavers turning beau in his old
      age! He commenced with being a jockey; then he became an electioneerer;
      then a Methodist parson; then a builder of houses; and now he has dashed
      suddenly up to London, rushed into the clubs, mounted a wig, studied an
      ogle, and walks about the Opera House swinging a cane, and, at the age of
      fifty-six, punching young minors in the side, and saying tremulously, '<i>We</i>
      young fellows!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He hires pages to come to him in the Park with three-cornered notes,"
      said Fanny, "he opens each with affected nonchalance; looks full at the
      bearer; and cries aloud-'Tell your mistress I cannot refuse her:'&mdash;then
      canters off, with the air of a man persecuted to death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did you see what an immense pair of whiskers Chester has mounted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," answered a Mr. De Lacy; "A&mdash;&mdash; says he has cultivated
      them in order to 'plant out' his ugliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But vy <i>you</i> no talk, Monsieur de Dauphin?" said the Linettini
      gently, turning to Percy; "you ver silent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unhappily, I have been so long out of town that these anecdotes of the
      day are caviare to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But so," cried Saville, "would a volume of French Memoirs be to any one
      that took it up for the first time; yet the French Memoirs amuse one
      exactly as much as if one had lived with the persons written of. Now that
      ought to be the case with conversations upon persons. I flatter myself,
      Fanny, that you and I hit off characters so well by a word or two, that no
      one who hears us wants to know anything more about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you," said Godolphin; "and that is the reason you never talk of
      yourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! Apropos of egoism, did you meet Jack Barabel in Rome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, writing his travels. 'Pray,' said he to me (seizing me by the
      button) in the Coliseum, 'What do you think is the highest order of
      literary composition?' 'Why, an epic, I fancy,' said I; 'or perhaps a
      tragedy, or a great history, or a novel like Don Quixote.' 'Pooh!' quoth
      Barabel, looking important, 'there's nothing so high in literature as a
      good book of travels;' then sinking his voice into a whisper and laying
      his finger wisely on his nose, he hissed out, 'I have a quarto, sir, in
      the press!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha!" laughed Stracey, the old wit, picking his teeth, and speaking
      for the first time; "if you tell Barabel you have seen a handsome woman,
      he says, mysteriously frowning, 'Handsome, sir! has she travelled?&mdash;answer
      me that!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But have you seen Paulton's new equipage? Brown carriage, brown liveries,
      brown harness, brown horses, while Paulton and his wife sit within dressed
      in brown cap-a-pie. The best of it is that Paulton went to his coachmaker,
      to order his carriage, saying, 'Mr. Houlditch, I am growing old&mdash;too
      old to be eccentric any longer; I must have something remarkably plain;'
      and to this hour Paulton goes <i>brown</i>-ing about the town, crying out
      to every one, 'Nothing like simplicity, believe me.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He discharged his coachman for wearing white gloves instead of brown,"
      said Stracey. "'What do you mean, sir,' cried he, 'with your d&mdash;d
      showy vulgarities?&mdash;don't you see me toiling my soul out to be plain
      and quiet, and you must spoil all, by not being <i>brown</i> enough!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Godolphin, you seem pensive," whispered Fanny; "yet we are tolerably
      amusing, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Fanny," answered Godolphin, rousing himself, "the dialogue is
      gay, the actors know their parts, the lights are brilliant; but&mdash;the
      scene&mdash;the scene cannot shift for me! Call it what you will, I am not
      deceived. I see the paint and the canvas, but&mdash;and yet, away these
      thoughts! Shall I fill your glass, Fanny?"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      AN EVENT OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS IN THIS HISTORY.&mdash;GODOLPHIN
      A SECOND TIME LEAVES ENGLAND.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldolphin was welcomed with enthusiasm by the London world. His graces,
      his manners, his genius, his bon ton, and his bonnes fortunes, were the
      theme of every society. Verses imputed to him,&mdash;some erroneously,
      some truly,&mdash;were mysteriously circulated from hand to hand; and
      every one envied the fair inspirers to whom they were supposed to be
      addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not my intention to reiterate the wearisome echo of novelists, who
      descant on fashion and term it life. No description of rose-coloured
      curtains and buhl cabinets&mdash;no miniature paintings of boudoirs and
      salons&mdash;no recital of conventional insipidities, interlarded with
      affected criticisms, and honoured by the name of dramatic dialogue, shall
      lend their fascination to these pages. Far other and far deeper aims are
      mine in stooping to delineate the customs and springs of polite life. The
      reader must give himself wholly up to me; he must prepare to go with me
      through the grave as through the gay, and unresistingly to thread the dark
      and subtle interest which alone I can impart to these memoirs, or&mdash;let
      him close the book at once. I promise him novelty; but it is not, when
      duly scanned, a novelty of a light and frivolous cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But throughout that routine of dissipation in which he chased the phantom
      Forgetfulness, Godolphin sighed for the time he had fixed on for leaving
      the scenes in which it was pursued. Of Constance's present existence he
      heard nothing; of her former triumphs and conquests he heard everywhere.
      And when did he ever meet one face, however fair, which could awaken a
      single thought of admiration? while hers was yet all faithfully glassed in
      his remembrance. I know nothing that so utterly converts society into "the
      gallery of pictures," as the recollection of one loved and lost. That
      recollection has but two cures&mdash;Time and the hermitage. Foreigners
      impute to us the turn for sentiment; alas! there are no people who have it
      less. We seek for ever after amusement; and there is not one popular
      prose-book in our language in which the more tender and yearning secrets
      of the heart form the subject-matter. The Corinne and the Julie weary us,
      or we turn them into sorry jests!
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, a little before his departure from England&mdash;that a
      lingering and vague hope, of which Constance was the object, had
      considerably protracted beyond the allotted time&mdash;Godolphin was at a
      house in which the hostess was a relation to Lord Erpingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard," asked Lady G&mdash;&mdash;, "that my cousin Erpingham is
      to be married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed; to whom?" said Godolphin, eagerly. "To Miss Vernon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sudden as was the shock, Godolphin heard, and changed neither hue nor
      muscle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you certain of this?" asked a lady present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite: Lady Erpingham is my authority; I received the news from herself
      this very day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does she seem pleased with the match?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I can scarcely say, for the letter contradicts itself in every
      passage. Now, she congratulates herself on having so charming a
      daughter-in-law; now, she suddenly stops short to observe what a pity it
      is that young men should be so precipitate! Now, she says what a great
      match it will be for her dear ward! and now, what a happy one it will be
      for Erpingham! In short, she does not know whether to be pleased or vexed;
      and that, pour dire vrai, is my case also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, indeed," observed the former speaker, "Miss Vernon has played her
      cards well. Lord Erpingham would have been a great match in himself, with
      his person and reputation. Ah! she was always an ambitious girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a proud one," said Lady G&mdash;&mdash;. "Well, I suppose Erpingham
      House will be the rendezvous to all the blues, and wits, and savans. Miss
      Vernon is another Aspasia, I hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate girls who are so designing," said the lady who spoke before, and
      had only one daughter, very ugly, who, at the age of thirty-five, was
      about to accept her first offer, and marry a younger son in the Guards. "I
      think she's rather vulgar; for my part, I doubt if&mdash;I shall patronise
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do <i>you</i> think of it, Mr. Godolphin?&mdash;you have seen
      Miss Vernon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about ten days after this conversation that Godolphin, waiting at a
      hotel in Dover the hour at which the packet set sail for Calais, took up
      the Morning Post; and the first passage that met his eye was the one which
      I transcribe:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marriage in High Life.&mdash;On Thursday last, at Wendover Castle, the
      Earl of Erpingham, to Constance, only daughter of the celebrated Mr.
      Vernon. The bride was dressed, &amp;c., &mdash;&mdash;" And then followed
      the trite, yet pompous pageantry of words&mdash;the sounding nothings&mdash;with
      which ladies who become countesses are knelled into marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dream is over!" said Godolphin mournfully, as the paper fell to the
      ground; and, burying his face within his hands, he remained motionless
      till they came to announce the moment of departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus Percy Godolphin left, for the second time, his native shores.
      When we return to him, what changes will the feelings now awakened within
      him, have worked in his character! The drops that trickle within the
      cavern harden, yet brighten into spars as they indurate. Nothing is more
      polished, nothing more cold, than that wisdom which is the work of former
      tears, of former passions, and is formed within a musing and solitary
      mind!

      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE BRIDE ALONE.&mdash;A DIALOGUE POLITICAL AND MATRIMONIAL.&mdash;CONSTANCE
      GENIUS FOR DIPLOMACY.&mdash;THE CHARACTER OF HER ASSEMBLIES.&mdash;HER
      CONQUEST OVER LADY DELVILLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring me that book; place that table nearer; and leave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abigail obeyed the orders, and the young Countess of Erpingham was
      alone. Alone! what a word for a young and beautiful bride in the first
      months of her marriage! Alone! and in the heart of that mighty city in
      which rank and wealth&mdash;and they were hers&mdash;are the idols adored
      by millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a room fancifully and splendidly decorated. Flowers and perfumes
      were, however, its chief luxury; and from the open window you might see
      the trees in the old Mall deepening into the rich verdure of June. That
      haunt, too&mdash;a classical haunt for London&mdash;was at the hour I
      speak of full of gay and idle life; and there was something fresh and
      joyous in the air, the sun, and the crowd of foot and horse that swept
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the glory gone from your brow, Constance?&mdash;or the proud gladness
      from your eye? Alas! are not the blessings of the world like the enchanted
      bullets?&mdash;that which pierces our heart is united with the gift which
      our heart desired!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Erpingham entered the room. "Well, Constance," said he, "shall you
      ride on horseback to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I wish you would call on Lady Delville. You see Delville is of my
      party: we sit together. You should be very civil to her, and I did not
      think you were so the other night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish Lady Delville to support your political interest; and, if I
      mistake not, you think her at present lukewarm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, my dear lord, will you place confidence in my discretion? I promise
      you, if you will leave me undisturbed in my own plans, that Lady Delville
      shall be the most devoted of your party before the season is half over:
      but then, the means will not be those you advise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I advised none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;civility; a very poor policy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;n it, Constance! why, you would not frown a great person like
      Lady Delville into affection for us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lord, only try. Three months is all I ask. You will leave the
      management of politics to me ever afterwards! I was born a schemer. Am I
      not John Vernon's daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, do as you will," said Lord Erpingham; "but I see how it will
      end. However, you will call on Lady Delville to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you wish it, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Delville was a proud, great lady; not very much liked and not so
      often invited by her equals as if she had been agreeable and a flirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance knew with whom she had to treat. She called on Lady Delville
      that day. Lady Delville was at home: a pretty and popular Mrs. Trevor was
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Delville received her coolly&mdash;Constance was haughtiness itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go to the Duchess of Daubigny's to-night?" said Lady Delville in the
      course of their broken conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I do not. I like agreeable society. It shall be my object to form
      a circle that not one displeasing person shall obtain access to. Will you
      assist me, my dear Mrs. Trevor?"&mdash;and Constance turned, with her
      softest smile, to the lady she addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trevor was flattered: Lady Delville drew herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a small party at the duchess's," said the latter; "merely to meet
      the Duke and Duchess of C&mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, few people are capable of giving a suitable entertainment to the
      royal family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely none more so than the Duchess of Daubigny&mdash;her house so
      large, her rank so great!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are but poor ingredients towards the forming of an agreeable
      party," said Constance, coldly. "The mistake made by common minds is to
      suppose titles the only rank. Royal dukes love, above all other persons,
      to be amused; and amusement is the last thing generally provided for
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation fell into other channels. Constance rose to depart. She
      warmly pressed the hand of Mrs. Trevor, whom she had only seen once
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few persons come to me to-morrow evening," said she; "<i>do</i> waive
      ceremony, and join us. I can promise you that not one disagreeable person
      shall be present; and that the Duchess of Daubigny shall write for an
      invitation and be refused."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Trevor accepted the invitation.

    <p>
      Lady Delville was enraged beyond measure. Never was female tongue more
      bitter than hers at the expense of that insolent Lady Erpingham! Yet Lady
      Delville was secretly in grief; for the first time in her life, she was
      hurt at not having been asked to a party: and being hurt because she was
      not going, she longed most eagerly to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening came. Erpingham House was not large, but it was well
      adapted to the description of assembly its beautiful owner had invited.
      Statues, busts, pictures, books, scattered or arranged about the
      apartments, furnished matter for intellectual conversation, or gave at
      least an intellectual air to the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a hundred persons were present. They were selected from the most
      distinguished ornaments of the time. Musicians, painters, authors,
      orators, fine gentlemen, dukes, princes, and beauties. One thing, however,
      was imperatively necessary in order to admit them&mdash;the profession of
      liberal opinions. No Tory, however wise, eloquent or beautiful, could,
      that evening, have obtained the sesame to those apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance never seemed more lovely, and never before was she so winning.
      The coldness and the arrogance of her manner had wholly vanished. To every
      one she spoke; and to every one her voice, her manner, were kind, cordial,
      familiar, but familiar with a soft dignity that heightened the charm.
      Ambitious not only to please but to dazzle, she breathed into her
      conversation all the grace and culture of her mind. They who admired her
      the most were the most accomplished themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now exchanging with foreign nobles that brilliant trifling of the world in
      which there is often so much penetration, wisdom, and research into
      character; now with a kindling eye and animated cheek commenting, with
      poets and critics, on literature and the arts; now, in a more remote and
      quiet corner, seriously discussing, with hoary politicians, those affairs
      in which even they allowed her shrewdness and her grasp of intellect; and
      combining with every grace and every accomplishment a rare and dazzling
      order of beauty&mdash;we may readily imagine the sensation she created,
      and the sudden and novel zest which so splendid an Armida must have given
      to the tameness of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the next week, the party at Erpingham House was the theme of
      every conversation. Each person who had been there had met the lion he had
      been most anxious to see. The beauty had conversed with the poet, who had
      charmed her; the young debutant in science had paid homage to the great
      professor of its loftiest mysteries; the statesman had thanked the author
      who had defended his measures; the author had been delighted with the
      compliment of the statesman. Every one then agreed that, while the highest
      rank in the kingdom had been there, rank had been the least attraction;
      and those who before had found Constance repellent, were the very persons
      who now expatiated with the greatest rapture on the sweetness of her
      manners. Then, too, every one who had been admitted to the coterie dwelt
      on the rarity of the admission; and thus, all the world were dying for an
      introduction to Erpingham House&mdash;partly, because it was agreeable&mdash;principally,
      because it was difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      It soon became a compliment to the understanding to say of a person, "He
      goes to Lady Erpingham's!" They who valued themselves on their
      understandings moved heaven and earth to become popular with the beautiful
      countess. Lady Delville was not asked; Lady Delville was furious: she
      affected disdain, but no one gave her credit for it. Lord Erpingham teased
      Constance on this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see I was right; for you have affronted Lady Delville. She has made
      Delville look coolly on me; in a few weeks he will be a Tory; think of
      that, Lady Erpingham!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One month more," answered Constance, with a smile, "and you shall see."
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, Lady Delville and Lady Erpingham met at a large party. The
      latter seated herself by her haughty enemy; not seeming to heed Lady
      Delville's coolness, Constance entered into conversation with her. She
      dwelt upon books, pictures, music: her manner was animated, and her wit
      playful. Pleased, in spite of herself, Lady Delville warmed from her
      reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lady Delville," said Constance, suddenly turning her bright
      countenance on the countess with an expression of delighted surprise,
      "will you forgive me?&mdash;I never dreamed before that you were so
      charming a person! I never conceal my sentiments: and I own with regret
      and shame that, till this moment, I had never seen in your mind&mdash;whatever
      I might in your person&mdash;those claims to admiration which were
      constantly dinned into my ear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Delville actually coloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray," continued Constance, "condescend to permit me to a nearer
      acquaintance. Will you dine with us on Thursday?&mdash;we shall have only
      nine persons beside yourself: but they are the nine persons whom I most
      esteem and admire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Delville accepted the invitation. From that hour, Lady Delville&mdash;who
      had at first resented, from the deepest recess of her heart, Constance
      Vernon's accession to rank and wealth,&mdash;who, had Constance deferred
      to her early acquaintance, would have always found something in her she
      could have affected to despise; from that hour, Lady Delville was the
      warmest advocate, and a little time after, the sincerest follower, of the
      youthful countess.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      AN INSIGHT INTO THE REAL GRANDE MONDE;&mdash;BEING A SEARCH BEHIND THE
      ROSE-COLOURED CURTAINS.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time we now speak of was the most brilliant the English world, during
      the last half century, has known. Lord Byron was in his brief and dazzling
      zenith; De Stael was in London; the Peace had turned the attention of rich
      idlers to social enjoyment and to letters. There was an excitement, and a
      brilliancy, and a spirituality, about our circles, which we do not
      recognise now. Never had a young and ambitious woman&mdash;a beauty and a
      genius&mdash;a finer moment for the commencement of her power. It was
      Constance's early and bold resolution to push to the utmost&mdash;even to
      exaggeration&mdash;a power existing in all polished states, but now mostly
      in this,&mdash;the power of fashion! This mysterious and subtle engine she
      was eminently skilled to move according to her will. Her intuitive
      penetration into character, her tact, and her grace, were exactly the
      talents Fashion most demands; and they were at present devoted only to
      that sphere. The rudeness that she mingled, at times, with the bewitching
      softness and ease of manner she could command at others, increased the
      effect of her power. It is much to intimidate as well as to win. And her
      rudeness in a very little while grew popular; for it was never exercised
      but on those whom the world loves to see humbled. Modest merit in any
      rank; and even insolence, if accompanied with merit, were always safe from
      her satire. It was the hauteur of foolish duchesses or purse-proud
      roturiers that she loved, and scrupled not, to abase.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the independence of her character was mixed with extraordinary
      sweetness of temper. Constance could not be in a passion: it was out of
      her nature. If she was stung, she could utter a sarcasm; but she could not
      frown or raise her voice. There was that magic in her, that she was always
      feminine. She did not stare young men out of countenance; she never
      addressed them by their Christian names; she never flirted&mdash;never
      coquetted: the bloom and flush of modesty was yet all virgin upon her
      youth. She, the founder of a new dynasty, avoided what her successors and
      contemporaries have deemed it necessary to incur. She was the leader of
      fashion; but&mdash;it is a miraculous union&mdash;she was respectable!
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period, some new dances were brought into England. These dances
      found much favour in the eves of several great ladies young enough to
      dance them. They met at each other's houses in the morning to practise the
      steps. Among these was Lady Erpingham; her house became the favourite
      rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Marquis of Dartington was one of the little knot. Celebrated for
      his great fortune, his personal beauty, and his general success, he
      resolved to fall in love with Lady Erpingham. He devoted himself
      exclusively to her; he joined her in the morning in her rides&mdash;in the
      evening in her gaieties. He had fallen in love with her?&mdash;yes!&mdash;did
      he love her?&mdash;not the least. But he was excessively idle!&mdash;what
      else could he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance early saw the attentions and designs of Lord Dartington. There
      is one difficulty in repressing advances in great society&mdash;one so
      easily becomes ridiculous by being a prude. But Constance dismissed Lord
      Dartington with great dexterity. This was the occasion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the apartments in Erpingham House communicated with a conservatory.
      In this conservatory Constance was alone one morning, when Lord
      Dartington, who had entered the house with Lord Erpingham, joined her. He
      was not a man who could ever become sentimental; he was rather the gay
      lover&mdash;rather the Don Gaolor than the Amadis; but he was a little
      abashed before Constance. He trusted, however, to his fine eyes and his
      good complexion&mdash;plucked up courage; and, picking a flower from the
      same plant Constance was tending, said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe there is a custom in some part of the world to express love by
      flowers. May I, dear Lady Erpingham, trust to this flower to express what
      I dare not utter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance did not blush, nor look confused, as Lord Dartington had hoped
      and expected. One who had been loved by Godolphin was not likely to feel
      much agitation at the gallantry of Lord Dartington; but she looked gravely
      in his face, paused a little before she answered, and then said, with a
      smile that abashed the suitor more than severity could possibly have done:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lord Dartington, do not let us mistake each other. I live in the
      world like other women, but I am not altogether like them. Not another
      word of gallantry to me alone, as you value my friendship. In a crowded
      room pay me as many compliments as you like. It will flatter my vanity to
      have you in my train. And now, just do me the favour to take these
      scissors and cut the dead leaves off that plant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dartington, to use a common phrase, "hummed and hawed." He looked,
      too, a little angry. An artful and shrewd politician, it was not
      Constance's wish to cool the devotion, though she might the attachment, of
      a single member of her husband's party. With a kind look&mdash;but a look
      so superior, so queen-like, so free from the petty and coquettish
      condescension of the sex, that the gay lord wondered from that hour how he
      could ever have dreamed of Constance as of certain other ladies&mdash;she
      stretched her hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are friends, Lord Dartington?&mdash;and now we know each other, we
      shall be so always."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Dartington bowed confusedly over the beautiful hand he touched; and
      Constance, walking into the drawing-room, sent for Lord Erpingham on
      business&mdash;Dartington took his leave.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MARRIED STATE OF CONSTANCE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Constance, Countess of Erpingham, was young, rich, lovely as a dream,
      worshipped as a goddess. Was she happy? and was her whole heart occupied
      with the trifles that surrounded her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Deep within her memory was buried one fatal image that she could not
      exorcise. The reproaching and mournful countenance of Godolphin rose
      before her at all times and seasons. The charm of his presence no other
      human being could renew. His eloquent and noble features, living, and
      glorious with genius and with passion, his sweet deep voice, his
      conversation, so rich with mind and knowledge, and the subtle delicacy
      with which he applied its graces to some sentiment dedicated to her,
      (delicious flattery, of all flatteries the most attractive to a sensitive
      and intellectual woman!)&mdash;these occurred to her again and again, and
      rendered all she saw around her flat, wearisome, insipid. Nor was this
      deep-seated and tender weakness the only serpent&mdash;if I may use so
      confused a metaphor&mdash;in the roses of her lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here I invoke the reader's graver attention. The fate of women in all
      the more polished circles of society is eminently unnatural and unhappy.
      The peasant and his dame are on terms of equality&mdash;equality even of
      ambition: no career is open to one and shut to the other;&mdash;equality
      even of hardship, and hardship is employment: no labour occupies the whole
      energies of the man, but leaves those of the woman unemployed. Is this the
      case with the wives in a higher station?&mdash;the wives of the lawyer,
      the merchant, the senator, the noble? There, the men have their
      occupations; and the women (unless, like poor Fanny, work-bags and parrots
      can employ them) none. They are idle. They employ the imagination and the
      heart. They fall in love and are wretched; or they remain virtuous, and
      are either wearied by an eternal monotony or they fritter away intellect,
      mind, character, in the minutest frivolities&mdash;frivolities being their
      only refuge from stagnation. Yes! there is one very curious curse for the
      sex which men don't consider! Once married, the more aspiring of them have
      no real scope for ambition: the ambition gnaws away their content, and
      never find elsewhere wherewithal to feed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Constance's especial misfortune. Her lofty, and restless, and
      soaring spirit pined for a sphere of action, and ballrooms and boudoirs
      met it on every side. One hope she did indeed cherish; that hope was the
      source of her intriguings and schemes, of her care for seeming trifles,
      the waste of her energies on seeming frivolities. This hope, this object,
      was to diminish&mdash;to crush, not only the party which had forsaken her
      father, but the power of that order to which she belonged herself; which
      she had entered only to humble. But this hope was a distant and chill
      vision. She was too rational to anticipate an early and effectual change
      in our social state, and too rich in the treasures of mind to be the
      creature of one idea. Satiety&mdash;the common curse of the great;&mdash;crept
      over her day by day. The powers within her lay stagnant&mdash;the keen
      intellect rusted in its sheath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it," said she to the beautiful Countess of &mdash;&mdash;, "that
      you seem always so gay and so animated; that with all your vivacity and
      tenderness, you are never at a loss for occupation? You never seem weary&mdash;ennuyee&mdash;why
      is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you," said the pretty countess, archly; "I change my lovers
      every month." Constance blushed, and asked no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many women in her state, influenced by contagious example, wearied by a
      life in which the heart had no share; without children, without a guide;
      assailed and wooed on all sides, in all shapes;&mdash;many women might
      have ventured, if not into love, at least into coquetry. But Constance
      remained as bright and cold as ever&mdash;"the unsunned snow!" It might
      be, indeed, that the memory of Godolphin preserved her safe from all
      lesser dangers. The asbestos once conquered by fire can never be consumed
      by it; but there was also another cause in Constance's very nature&mdash;it
      was pride!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! if men could but dream of what a proud woman endures in those caresses
      which humble her, they would not wonder why proud women are so difficult
      to subdue. This is a matter on which we all ponder much, but we dare not
      write honestly upon it. But imagine a young, haughty, guileless beauty,
      married to a man whom she neither loves nor honours; and so far from that
      want of love rendering her likely to fall hereafter, it is more probable
      that it will make her recoil from the very name of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the Dowager Lady Erpingham died; an event sincerely
      mourned by Constance, and which broke the strongest tie that united the
      young countess to her lord. Lord Erpingham and Constance, indeed, now saw
      but little of each other. Like most men six feet high, with large black
      whiskers, the earl was vain of his person; and, like most rich noblemen,
      he found plenty of ladies who assured him he was irresistible. He had soon
      grown angry at the unadmiring and calm urbanity of Constance; and, living
      a great deal with single men, he formed liaisons of the same order as they
      do. He was, however, sensible that he had been fortunate in the choice of
      a wife. His political importance the wisdom of Constance had quadrupled;
      at the least; his house she had rendered the most brilliant in London, and
      his name the most courted in the lists of the peerage. Though munificent,
      she was not extravagant; though a beauty, she did not intrigue; neither,
      though his inconstancy was open, did she appear jealous; nor, whatever the
      errors of his conduct, did she ever disregard his interest, disobey his
      wishes, or waver from the smooth and continuous sweetness of her temper.
      Of such a wife Lord Erpingham could not complain: he esteemed her, praised
      her, asked her advice, and stood a little in awe of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, Constance! had you been the daughter of a noble or a peasant&mdash;had
      you been the daughter of any man but John Vernon&mdash;what a treasure
      beyond price, without parallel, would that heart, that beauty, that genius
      have been!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE PLEASURE OF RETALIATING HUMILIATION.&mdash;CONSTANCE'S DEFENCE OF
      FASHION.&mdash;REMARKS ON FASHION.&mdash;GODOLPHIN'S WHEREABOUT.&mdash;FANNY
      MILLINGER'S CHARACTER OF HERSELF.&mdash;WANT OF COURAGE IN MORALISTS.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a proud moment for Constance when the Duchess of Winstoun and Lady
      Margaret Midgecombe wrote to her, worried her, beset her, for a smile, a
      courtesy, an invitation, or a ticket to Almack's.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had at first thought to cry her down; to declare that she was
      plebeian, mad, bizarre, and a blue. It was all in vain. Constance rose
      every hour. They struggled against the conviction, but it would not do.
      The first person who confounded them with a sense of their error was the
      late King, then Regent; he devoted himself to Lady Erpingham for a whole
      evening, at a ball given by himself. From that hour they were assured they
      had been wrong: they accordingly called on her the next day. Constance
      received them with the same coldness she had always evinced; but they went
      away declaring they never saw any one whose manners were so improved. They
      then sent her an invitation! she refused it; a second! she refused; a
      third, begging her to fix the day!!! she fixed the day, and disappointed
      them. Lord bless us!&mdash;how sorry they were, how alarmed, how
      terrified!&mdash;their dear Lady Erpingham must be ill!&mdash;they sent
      every day for the next week to know how she was!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Mrs. Trevor to Lady Erpingham,&mdash;"why do you continue so
      cruel to these poor people? I know they were very impertinent, and so
      forth, once; but it is surely wiser and more dignified now to forgive; to
      appear unconscious of the past: people of the world ought not to quarrel
      with each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, and yet you are mistaken," said Constance: "I do forgive,
      and I don't quarrel; but my opinion, my contempt, remain the same, or are
      rather more disdainful than ever. These people are not worth losing the
      luxury we all experience in expressing contempt. I continue, therefore,
      but quietly and without affectation, to indulge that luxury. Besides, I
      own to you, my dear Mrs. Trevor, I do think that the mere insolence of
      titles must fairly and thoroughly be put down, if we sincerely wish to
      render society agreeable; and where can we find a better example for
      punishment than the Duchess of Winstoun?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear Lady Erpingham, you are thought insolent: your friend, Lady
      &mdash;&mdash;, is called insolent, too;&mdash;are you sure the charge is
      not merited?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I allow the justice of the charge; but you will observe, ours is not the
      insolence of rank: we have made it a point to protect, to the utmost, the
      poor and unfriended of all circles. Are we ever rude to governesses or
      companions, or poor writers, or musicians? When a man marries below him,
      do we turn our backs on the poor wife? Do we not, on the contrary, lavish
      our attention on her, and throw round her equivocal and joyless state the
      protection of Fashion? No, no! <i>our</i> insolence is Justice! it is the
      chalice returned to the lips which prepared it; it is insolence to the
      insolent; reflect, and you will allow it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fashion that Constance set and fostered was of a generous order; but
      it was not suited to the majority; it was corrupted by her followers into
      a thousand basenesses. In vain do we make a law, if the general spirit is
      averse to the law. Constance could humble the great; could loosen the
      links of extrinsic rank; could undermine the power of titles; but that was
      all! She could abase the proud, but not elevate the general tone: for one
      slavery she only substituted another,&mdash;people hugged the chains of
      Fashion, as before they hugged those of Titular Arrogance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst the gossip of the day Constance heard much of Godolphin, and all
      spoke of him with interest&mdash;even those who could not comprehend his
      very intricate and peculiar character. Separated from her by lands and
      seas, there seemed no danger in allowing herself the sweet pleasure of
      hearing his actions and his mind discussed. She fancied she did not permit
      herself to <i>love</i> him; she was too pure not to start at such an idea;
      but her mind was not so regulated, so trained and educated in sacred
      principle, that she forbade herself the luxury to <i>remember.</i> Of his
      present mode of life she heard little. He was traced from city to city;
      from shore to shore; from the haughty noblesse of Vienna to the gloomy
      shrines of Memphis, by occasional report, and seemed to tarry long in no
      place. This roving and unsettled life, which secretly assured her of her
      power, suffused his image in all tender and remorseful dyes. Ah! where is
      that one person to been vied, could we read the heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      The actress had heard incidentally from Saville of Godolphin's attachment
      to the beautiful countess. She longed to see her; and when, one night at
      the theatre, she was informed that Lady Erpingham was in the Lord
      Chamberlain's box close before her, she could scarcely command her
      self-possession sufficiently to perform with her wonted brilliancy of
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was greatly struck by the singular nobleness of Lady Erpingham's face
      and person: and Godolphin rose in her estimation, from the justice of the
      homage he had rendered to so fair a shrine. What a curious trait, by the
      by, that is in women;&mdash;their exaggerated anxiety to see one who has
      been loved by the man in whom they themselves take interest: and the
      manner which the said man rises or falls in their estimation, according as
      they admire, or are disappointed in, the object of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so," said Saville, supping one night with the actress, "you think the
      world does not overlaud Lady Erpingham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: she is what Medea would have been, if innocent&mdash;full of majesty,
      and yet of sweetness. It is the face of a queen of some three thousand
      years back. I could have worshipped her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My little Fanny, you are a strange creature. Methinks you have a dash of
      poetry in you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody who has not written poetry could ever read my character," answered
      Fanny, with naivete, yet with truth. "Yet you have not much of the ideal
      about you, pretty one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; because I was so early thrown on myself, that I was forced to make
      independence my chief good. I soon saw that if I followed my heart to and
      fro, wherever it led me, I should be the creature of every breath&mdash;the
      victim of every accident: I should have been the very soul of romance;
      lived on a smile; and died, perhaps, in a ditch at last. Accordingly, I
      set to work with my feelings, and pared and cut them down to a convenient
      compass. Happy for me that I did so! What would have become of me if,
      years go, when I loved Godolphin, I had thrown the whole world of my heart
      upon him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he has generosity; he would not have deserted you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I should have wearied him," answered Fanny; "and that would have been
      quite enough for me. But I did love him well, and purely&mdash;(ah! you
      may smile!)&mdash;and disinterestedly. I was only fortified in my
      resolution not to love any one too much, by perceiving that he had <i>affection</i>
      but no <i>sympathy</i> for me. His nature was different from mine. I am <i>woman</i>
      in everything, and Godolphin is always sighing for a <i>goddess!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to sketch your character, Fanny. It is original, though not
      strongly marked. I never met with it in any book; yet it is true to your
      sex, and to the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Few people could paint me exactly," answered Fanny. "The danger is that
      they would make too much or too little of me. But such as I am, the world
      ought to know what is so common, and, as you think, so undescribed."
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, beautiful Constance, farewell for the present! I leave you
      surrounded by power, and pomp, and adulation. Enjoy as you may that for
      which you sacrificed affection!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE VISIONARY AND HIS DAUGHTER&mdash;AN ENGLISHMAN, SUCH AS FOREIGNERS
      IMAGINE THE ENGLISH.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now present the reader to characters very different from those
      which have hitherto passed before his eye. Without the immortal city,
      along the Appia Via, there dwelt a singular and romantic visionary, of the
      name of Volktman. He was by birth a Dane; and nature had bestowed on him
      that frame of mind which might have won him a distinguished career, had
      she placed the period of his birth in the eleventh century. Volktman was
      essentially a man belonging to the past time: the character of his
      enthusiasm was weird and Gothic; with beings of the present day he had no
      sympathy; their loves, their hatreds, their politics, their literature,
      awoke no echo in his breast. He did not affect to herd with them; his life
      was solitude, and its occupation study&mdash;and study of that nature
      which every day unfitted him more and more for the purposes of existence.
      In a word, he was a reader of the stars; a believer in the occult and
      dreamy science of astrology. Bred up to the art of sculpture, he had early
      in life sought Rome, as the nurse of inspiration; but even then he had
      brought with him the dark and brooding temper of his northern tribe. The
      images of the classic world; the bright, and cold, and beautiful
      divinities, whose natures as well as shapes the marble simulation of life
      is so especially adapted to represent; spoke but little to Volktman's
      pre-occupied and gloomy imagination. Faithful to the superstitions and the
      warriors of the North, the loveliness and majesty of the southern
      creations but called forth in him the desire to apply the principles by
      which they were formed to the embodying those stern visions which his
      haggard and dim fancies only could invoke. This train of inspiration
      preserved him, at least, from the deadliest vice in a worshipper of the
      arts&mdash;commonplace. He was no servile and trite imitator; his very
      faults were solemn and commanding. But before he had gained that long
      experience which can alone perfect genius, his natural energies were
      directed to new channels. In an illness which prevented his applying to
      his art, he had accidentally sought entertainment in a certain work upon
      astrology. The wild and imposing theories of the science&mdash;if science
      it may be called&mdash;especially charmed and invited him. The clear
      bright nights of his fatherland were brought back to his remembrance; he
      recalled the mystic and unanalysed impressions with which he had gazed
      upon the lights of heaven; and he imagined that the very vagueness of his
      feelings was a proof of the certainty of the science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sons of the North are pre-eminently liable to be affected by that
      romance of emotion which the hushed and starry aspect of night is
      calculated to excite. The long-broken luxurious silence that, in their
      frozen climate, reigns from the going down of the sun to its rise; the
      wandering and sudden meteors that disport, as with an impish life, along
      the noiseless and solemn heaven; the peculiar radiance of the stars; and
      even the sterile and severe features of the earth, which those stars light
      up with their chill and ghostly serenity, serve to deepen the effect of
      the wizard tales which are instilled into the ear of childhood, and to
      connect the less known and more visionary impulses of life with the
      influences, or at least with the associations, of Night and Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Volktman, more alive than even his countrymen are wont to be, to
      superstitious impressions, the science on which he had chanced came with
      an all-absorbing interest and fascination. He surrendered himself wholly
      to his new pursuit. By degrees the block and the chisel were neglected,
      and, though he still worked from time to time, he ceased to consider the
      sculptor's art as the vocation of his life and the end of his ambition.
      Fortunately, though not rich, Volktman was not without the means of
      existence, nor even without the decent and proper comforts: so that he was
      enabled, as few men are, to indulge his ardour for unprofitable
      speculations, albeit to the exclusion of lucrative pursuits. It may be
      noted, that when a man is addicted to an occupation that withdraws him
      from the world, any great affliction tends to confirm, without hope of
      cure, his inclinations to solitude. The world, distasteful, in that it
      gave no pleasure, becomes irremediably hateful when it is coupled with the
      remembrance of pain. Volktman had married an Italian, a woman who loved
      him entirely, and whom he loved with that strong though uncaressing
      affection common to men of his peculiar temper. Of the gay and social
      habits and constitution of her country, the Italian was not disposed to
      suffer the astrologer to dwell only among the stars. She sought, playfully
      and kindly, to attract him towards human society; and Volktman could not
      always resist&mdash;as what man earth-born can do?&mdash;the influence of
      the fair presider over his house and hearth. It happened, that on one day
      in which she peculiarly wished his attendance at some one of those parties
      in which Englishmen think the notion of festivity strange&mdash;for it
      includes conversation&mdash;Volktman had foretold the menace of some great
      misfortune. Uncertain, from the character of the prediction, whether to
      wish his wife to remain at home or to go abroad, he yielded to her wish,
      and accompanied her to her friend's house. A young Englishman lately
      arrived at Rome, and already celebrated in the circles of that city for
      eccentricity of life and his passion for beauty, was of the party. He
      appeared struck with the sculptor's wife; and in his attentions, Volktman,
      for the first and the last time, experienced the pangs of jealousy; he
      hurried his wife away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their return home, whether or not a jewel worn by the signora had
      attracted the cupidity of some of the lawless race who live through
      gaining, and profiting by, such information, they were attacked by two
      robbers in the obscure and ill-lighted suburb. Though Volktman offered no
      resistance, the manner of their assailants was rude and violent. The
      signora was fearfully alarmed; her shrieks brought a stranger to their
      assistance; it was the English youth who had so alarmed the jealousy of
      Volktman. Accustomed to danger in his profession of a gallant, the
      Englishman seldom, in those foreign lands, went from home at night without
      the protection of pistols. At the sight of firearms, the ruffians felt
      their courage evaporate; they fled from their prey; and the Englishman
      assisted Volktman in conveying the Italian to her home. But the terror of
      the encounter operated fatally on a delicate frame; and within three weeks
      from that night Volktman was a widower.
    </p>
    <p>
      His marriage had been blessed with but one daughter, who at the time of
      this catastrophe was about eight years of age. His love for his child in
      some measure reconciled Volktman to life; and as the shock of the event
      subsided, he returned with a pertinacity which was now subjected to no
      interruption, to his beloved occupations and mysterious researches. One
      visitor alone found it possible to win frequent ingress to his seclusion;
      it was the young English man. A sentiment of remorse at the jealous
      feelings he had experienced, and for which his wife, though an Italian,
      had never given him even the shadow of a cause, had softened&mdash;into a
      feeling rendered kind by the associations of the deceased, and a vague
      desire to atone to her for an acknowledged error,&mdash;the dislike he had
      at first conceived against the young man. This was rapidly confirmed by
      the gentle and winning manners of the stranger, by his attentions to the
      deceased, to whom he had sent an English physician of great skill, and, as
      their acquaintance expanded, by the animated interest which he testified
      in the darling theories of the astrologer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened also that Volktman's mother had been the daughter of Scotch
      parents. She had taught him the English tongue; and it was the only
      language, save his own, which he spoke as a native. This circumstance
      tended greatly to facilitate his intercourse with the traveller; and he
      found in the society of a man ardent, sensitive, melancholy, and addicted
      to all abstract contemplation, a pleasure which, among the keen, but
      uncultivated intellects of Italy, he had never enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently, then, came the young Englishman to the lone house on the Appia
      Via; and the mysterious and unearthly conversation of the starry visionary
      afforded to him, who had early learned to scrutinise the varieties of his
      kind, a strange delight, heightened by the contrast it presented to the
      worldly natures with which he usually associated, and the commonplace
      occupations of a life in pursuit of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was one who, child as she was, watched the coming of that young
      and beautiful stranger with emotion beyond her years. Brought up alone;
      mixing, since her mother's death, with no companions of her age; catching
      dim and solemn glimpses of her father's wild but lofty speculations; his
      books, filled with strange characters and imposing "words of mighty
      sound," open for ever to her young and curious gaze; it can scarce be
      matter of wonder that something strange and unworldly mingled with the
      elements of character which Lucilla Volktman early developed&mdash;a
      character that was nature itself, yet of a nature erratic and bizarre. Her
      impulses she obeyed spontaneously, but none fathomed their origin. She was
      not of a quiet and meek order of mind; but passionate, changeful, and
      restless. She would laugh and weep without apparent cause; and the colour
      on her cheek never seemed for two minutes the same; and the most fitful
      changes of an April heaven were immutability itself compared with the play
      and lustre of expression that undulated in her features and her wild,
      deep, eloquent eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her person resembled her mind; it was beautiful; but the beauty struck you
      less than the singularity of its character. Her eyes were of a darkness
      that at night seemed black; but her hair was of the brightest and purest
      auburn; her complexion, sometimes pale, sometimes radiant even to the
      flush of a fever, was delicate and clear; her teeth and mouth were lovely
      beyond all words; her hands and feet were small to a fault; and as she
      grew up (for we have forestalled her age in this description) her shape,
      though wanting in height, was in such harmony and proportion, that the
      mind of the sculptor would sometimes escape from the absorption of the
      astrologer and Volktman would gaze upon her with the same admiration that
      he would have bestowed, in spite of the subject, on the goddess-forms of
      Phidias or Canova. But then, this beauty was accompanied with such endless
      variety of gesture, often so wild, though always necessarily graceful,
      that the eye ached for that repose requisite for prolonged admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was spoken to, she did not often answer to the purpose, but
      rather appeared to reply as to some interrogatory of her own; in the midst
      of one occupation, she would start up to another; leave that, in turn,
      undone, and sit down in silence lasting for hours. Her voice, in singing,
      was exquisitely melodious; she had too, an intuitive talent for painting;
      and she read all the books that came in her way with an avidity that
      bespoke at once the restlessness and the genius of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This description of Lucilla must, I need scarcely repeat, be considered as
      applicable to her at some years distant from the time in which the young
      Englishman first attracted her childish but ardent imagination. To her,
      that face, with its regular and harmonious features, its golden hair, and
      soft, shy, melancholy aspect, seemed as belonging to a higher and brighter
      order of beings than those who, with exaggerated lineaments and swarthy
      hues, surrounded and displeased her. She took a strange and thrilling
      pleasure in creeping to his side, and looking up, when unobserved, at the
      countenance which, in his absence, she loved to imitate with her pencil by
      day; and to recall in her dreams at night. But she seldom spoke to him,
      and she shrank, covered with painful blushes, from his arms, whenever he
      attempted to bestow on her those caresses which children are wont to claim
      as an attention. Once, however, she summoned courage to ask him to teach
      her English, and he complied. She learned that language with surprising
      facility; and as Volktman loved its sound she grew familiar with its
      difficulties, by always addressing her father in a tongue which became
      inexpressibly dear to her. And the young stranger delighted to hear that
      soft and melodious voice, with its trembling, Italian accent, make music
      from the nervous and masculine language of his native land. Scarce
      accountably to himself, a certain tender and peculiar interest in the
      fortunes of this singular and bewitching child grew up within him&mdash;peculiar
      and not easily accounted for, in that it was not wholly the interest we
      feel in an engaging child, and yet was of no more interested nor sinister
      order. Were there truth in the science of the stars, I should say that
      they had told him her fate was to have affinity with his; and with that
      persuasion, something mysterious and more than ordinarily tender, entered
      into the affection he felt for the daughter of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman was himself of a romantic character. He had been
      self-taught; and his studies, irregular though often deep, had given
      directions to his intellect frequently enthusiastic and unsound. His
      imagination preponderated over his judgment; and any pursuit that
      attracted his imagination won his entire devotion, until his natural
      sagacity proved it deceitful. If at times, living as he did in that daily
      world which so sharpens our common sense, he smiled at the persevering
      fervour of the astrologer, he more often shared it; and he became his
      pupil in "the poetry of heaven," with a secret but deep belief in the
      mysteries cultivated by his master. Carrying the delusion to its height, I
      fear that the enthusiast entered upon ground still more shadowy and
      benighted;&mdash;the old secrets of the alchymist, and perhaps even of
      those arcana yet more gloomy and less rational, were subjected to their
      serious contemplation; and night after night, they delivered themselves
      wholly up to that fearful and charmed fascination which the desire and
      effort to overleap our mortal boundaries produce even in the hardest and
      best regulated minds. The train of thought so long nursed by the abstruse
      and solitary Dane was, perhaps, a better apology for the weakness of
      credulity, than the youth and wandering fancy of the Englishman. But the
      scene around&mdash;not alluring to the one&mdash;fed to overflowing the
      romantic aspirations of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way home, as the stars (which night had been spent in reading)
      began to wink and fade, the Englishman crossed the haunted Almo, renowned
      of yore for its healing virtues, and in whose stream the far-famed
      simulacrum, (the image of Cybele), which fell from heaven, was wont to be
      laved with every coming spring: and around his steps, till he gained his
      home, were the relics and monuments of that superstition which sheds so
      much beauty over all that, in harsh reasoning, it may be said to degrade;
      so that his mind, always peculiarly alive to external impressions, was
      girt, as it were, with an atmosphere favourable both to the lofty
      speculation and the graceful credulities of romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman remained at Rome, with slight intervals of absence, for
      nearly three years. On the night before the day in which he received
      intelligence of an event that recalled him to his native country, he
      repaired at an hour accidentally later than usual to the astrologer's
      abode.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A CONVERSATION LITTLE APPERTAINING TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.&mdash;RESEARCHES
      INTO HUMAN FATE.&mdash;THE PREDICTION.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the apartment he found Lucilla seated on a low stool beside
      the astrologer. She looked up when she heard his footsteps; but her
      countenance seemed so dejected, that he turned involuntarily to that of
      Volktman for explanation. Volktman met his gaze with a steadfast and
      mournful aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened?" asked the Englishman: "you seem sad,&mdash;you do not
      greet me as usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been with the stars," replied the visionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They seem but poor company," rejoined the Englishman; "and do not appear
      to have much heightened your spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jest not, my friend," said Volktman; "it was for the loss of thee I
      looked sorrowful. I perceive that thou wilt take a journey soon, and that
      it will be of no pleasant nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" answered the Englishman, smilingly. "I ask leave to question the
      fact: you know better than any man how often, through an error in our
      calculations, through haste, even through an over-attention, astrological
      predictions are exposed to falsification; and at present I foresee so
      little chance of my quitting Rome, that I prefer the earthly probabilities
      to the celestial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My schemes are just, and the Heavens wrote their decrees in their
      clearest language," answered the astrologer. "Thou art on the eve of
      quitting Rome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what occasion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The astrologer hesitated&mdash;the young visitor pressed the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lord of the fourth house," said Volktman, reluctantly, "is located in
      the eleventh house. Thou knowest to whom the position portends disaster."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father!" said the Englishman, anxiously, and turning pale; "I think
      that position would relate to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doth," said the astrologer, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! I heard from him to-day; he is well&mdash;let me see the
      figures."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked over the mystic hieroglyphics of the art, inscribed
      on a paper that was placed before the visionary, with deep and
      scrutinising attention. Without bewildering the reader with those words
      and figures of weird sound and import which perplex the uninitiated, and
      entangle the disciple of astrology, I shall merely observe that there was
      one point in which the judgment appeared to admit doubt as to the
      signification. The Englishman insisted on the doubt; and a very learned
      and edifying debate was carried on between pupil and master, in the heat
      of which all recollection of the point in dispute (as is usual in such
      cases) evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not how it is," said the Englishman, "that I should give any
      credence to a faith which (craving your forgiveness) most men out of
      Bedlam concur, at this day, in condemning as wholly idle and absurd. For
      it may be presumed that men only incline to some unpopular theory in
      proportion as it flatters or favours them; and as for this theory of yours&mdash;of
      ours, if you will&mdash;it has foretold me nothing but misfortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thy horoscope," replied the astrologer, "is indeed singular and ominous:
      but, like my daughter, the exact minute (within almost a whole hour) of
      thy birth seems unknown; and however ingeniously we, following the
      ancients, have contrived means for correcting nativities, our predictions
      (so long as the exact period of birth is not ascertained) remain, in my
      mind, always liable to some uncertainty. Indeed, the surest method of
      reducing the supposed time to the true&mdash;that of 'Accidents,' is but
      partially given, as in thy case; for, with a negligence that cannot be too
      severely blamed or too deeply lamented, thou hast omitted to mark down, or
      remember, the days on which accidents&mdash;fevers, broken limbs, &amp;c.&mdash;occurred
      to thee; and this omission leaves a cloud over the bright chapters of fate&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which," interrupted the young man, "is so much the happier for me, in
      that it allows me some loophole for hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet," renewed the astrologer, as if resolved to deny his friend any
      consolation, "thy character, and the bias of thy habits, as well as the
      peculiarities of thy person&mdash;nay even the moles upon thy skin&mdash;accord
      with thy proposed horoscope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so!" said the Englishman, gaily. "You grant me, at least, the
      fairest of earthly gifts&mdash;the happiness of pleasing that sex which
      alone sweetens our human misfortunes. That gift I would sooner have, even
      accompanied as it is, than all the benign influences without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet," said the astrologer, "shalt thou even there be met with affliction;
      for Saturn had the power to thwart the star Venus, that was disposed to
      favour thee, and evil may be the result of the love thou inspirest. There
      is one thing remarkable in our science, which is especially worthy of
      notice in thy lot. The ancients, unacquainted with the star of Herschel,
      seem also scarcely acquainted with the character which the influence of
      that wayward and melancholy orb creates. Thus, the aspect of Herschel
      neutralises, in great measure, the boldness and ambition, and pride of
      heart, thou wouldst otherwise have drawn from the felicitous configuration
      of the stars around the Moon and Mercury at thy birth. That yearning for
      something beyond the narrow bounds of the world, that love for reverie,
      that passionate romance, yea, thy very leaning, despite thy worldly sense,
      to these occult and starry mysteries;&mdash;all are bestowed on thee by
      this new and potential planet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And hence, I suppose," said the Englishman, interested (as the astrologer
      had declared) in spite of himself, "hence that opposition in my nature of
      the worldly and romantic; hence, with you, I am the dreaming enthusiast;
      but the instant I regain the living and motley crowd, I shake off the
      influence with ease, and become the gay pursuer of social pleasures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never <i>at heart gay,</i>" muttered the astrologer; "Saturn and Herschel
      make not sincere mirth-makers." The Englishman did not hear or seem to
      hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," resumed the young man, musingly, "no! it is true that there is some
      counteraction of what, at times, I should have called my natural bent.
      Thus, I am bold enough, and covetous of knowledge, and not deaf to vanity;
      and yet I have no ambition. The desire to rise seems to me wholly
      unalluring: I scorn and contemn it as a weakness. But what matters it? so
      much the happier for me if, as you predict, my life be short. But how, if
      so unambitious and so quiet of habit, how can I imagine that my death will
      be violent as well as premature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as he spoke that the young Lucilla, who, with fixed eyes and lips
      apart, had been drinking in their conversation suddenly rose and left the
      room. They were used to her comings in and her goings out without cause or
      speech, and continued their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said the visionary; "can tranquillity of life, or care, or
      prudence, preserve us from our destiny? No sign is more deadly, whether by
      accident or murder, than that which couples Hyleg with Orion and Saturn.
      Yet, thou mayest pass the year in which that danger is foretold thee; and,
      beyond that time, peace, honour, good fortune, await thee. Better to have
      the menace of ill in early life than in its decline. Youth bears up
      against misfortune; but it withers the heart, and crushes the soul of
      age!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," said the young guest, haughtily, "we must do our best to
      contradict the starry evils by our own internal philosophy. We can make
      ourselves independent of fate; that independence is better than
      prosperity!" Then, changing his tone, he added,&mdash;"But you imagine
      that, by the power of other arts, we may control and counteract the
      prophecies of the stars&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How meanest thou?" said the astrologer, hastily. "Thou dost not suppose
      that alchymy, which is the servant of the heavenly host, is their
      opponent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," answered the disciple, "but you allow that we may be enabled to
      ward off evils, and to cure diseases, otherwise fatal to us, by the gift
      of Uriel and the charm of the Cabala?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," replied the visionary; "but then I opine that the discovery of
      these precious secrets was foretold to us by the Omniscient Book at our
      nativity; and, therefore, though the menace of evils be held out to us, so
      also is the probability of their correction or our escape. And I must own
      (pursued the enthusiast) that, to me, the very culture of those divine
      arts hath given a consolation amidst the evils to which I have been fated;
      so true seems it, that it is not in the outer nature, in the great
      elements, and in the bowels of the earth, but also within ourselves that
      we must look for the preparations whereby we are to achieve the wisdom of
      Zoroaster and Hermes. We must abstract ourselves from passion and earthly
      desires. Lapped in a celestial reverie, we must work out, by
      contemplation, the essence from the matter of things: nor can we dart into
      the soul of the Mystic World until we ourselves have forgotten the body;
      and by fast, by purity, and by thought, have become, in the flesh itself,
      a living soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more, and with an equal wildness of metaphysical eloquence, did the
      astrologer declare in praise of those arts condemned by the old Church;
      and it doth indeed appear from reference to the numerous works of the
      alchymists and magians yet extant, somewhat hastily and unjustly. For
      those books all unite in dwelling on the necessity of virtue, subdued
      passions and a clear mind, in order to become a fortunate and accomplished
      cabalist&mdash;a precept, by the way, not without its policy; for, if the
      disciple failed, the failure might be attributed to his own fleshly
      imperfections, not to any deficiency in the truth of the science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man listened to the visionary with an earnest and fascinated
      attention. Independent of the dark interest always attached to discourses
      of supernatural things more especially, we must allow, in the mouth of a
      fervent and rapt believer, there was that in the language and very person
      of the astrologer which inexpressibly enhanced the effect of the theme.
      Like most men acquainted with the literature of a country, but not
      accustomed to daily conversation with its natives, the English words and
      fashion of periods that occurred to Volktman were rather those used in
      books than in colloquy; and a certain solemnity and slowness of tone
      accompanied with the frequent, almost constant use of the pronoun singular&mdash;the
      thou and the thee, gave a strangeness and unfamiliar majesty to his
      dialect that suited well with the subjects on which he so loved to dwell.
      He himself was lean, gaunt, and wan; his cheeks were drawn and hollow; and
      thin locks, prematurely bleached to grey, fell in disorder round high,
      bare temples, in which the thought that is not of this world had paled the
      hue and furrowed the surface. But, as may be noted in many imaginative
      men, the life that seemed faint and chill in the rest of the frame,
      collected itself, as in a citadel, within the eye. Bright, wild, and deep,
      the expression of those blue large orbs told the intense enthusiasm of the
      mind within; and, even somewhat thrillingly, communicated a part of that
      emotion to those on whom they dwelt. No painter could have devised, nor
      even Volktman himself, in the fulness of his northern phantasy, have
      sculptured forth a better image of those pale and unearthly students who,
      in the darker ages, applied life and learning to one unhallowed vigil, the
      Hermes or the Gebir of the alchymist's empty science&mdash;dreamers, and
      the martyrs of their dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the discussion of mysteries which to detail would only weary while it
      perplexed the reader, the enthusiasts passed the greater portion of the
      night; and when at length the Englishman rose to depart, it cannot be
      denied that a solemn and boding emotion agitated his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have talked," said he, attempting a smile, "of things above this
      nether life; and here we are lost, uncertain. On one thing, however, we
      can decide; life itself is encompassed with gloom; sorrow and anxiety
      await even those upon whom the stars shed their most golden influence. We
      know not one day what the next shall bring!&mdash;no; I repeat it; no&mdash;in
      spite of your scheme, and your ephemeris, and your election of happy
      moments. But, come what will, Volktman, come all that you foretell to me;
      crosses in my love, disappointment in my life, melancholy in my blood, and
      a violent death in the very flush of my manhood,&mdash;Me: at least, Me!
      my soul, my heart, my better part, you shall never cast down, nor darken,
      nor deject. I move in a certain and serene circle; ambition cannot tempt
      me above it, nor misfortune cast me below!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Volktman looked at the speaker with surprise and admiration; the
      enthusiasm of a brave mind is the only fire broader and brighter than that
      of a fanatical one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! my young friend," he said, as he clashed the hand of his guest, "I
      would to Heaven that my predictions may be wrong: often and often they
      have been erroneous," added he bowing his head humbly; "they may be so in
      their reference to thee. So young, so brilliant, so beautiful too; so
      brave, yet so romantic of heart, I feel for all that may happen to thee&mdash;ay,
      far, far more deeply than aught which may be fated to myself; for I am an
      old man now, and long inured to disappointment; all the greenness of my
      life is gone: even could I attain to the Grand Secret the knowledge
      methinks would be too late. And, at my birth, my lot was portioned out
      unto me in characters so clear, that, while I have had time to acquiesce
      in it, I have had no hope to correct and change it. For Jupiter in Cancer,
      removed from the Ascendant, and not impedited of any other star, betokened
      me indeed some expertness in science, but a life of seclusion, and one
      that should bring not forth the fruits that its labour deserved. But there
      is so much in thy fate that ought to be bright and glorious, that it will
      be no common destiny marred, should the evil influences and the ominous
      seasons prevail against thee. But thou speakest boldly&mdash;boldly, and
      as one of a high soul, though it be sometimes clouded and led astray. And
      I, therefore, again and again impress upon thee, it is from thine own
      self, thine own character, thine own habits, that all evil, save that of
      death, will come. Wear, then, I implore thee, wear in thy memory, as a
      jewel, the first great maxim of alchymist and magian:&mdash;'Search
      thyself&mdash;correct thyself&mdash;subdue thyself:' it is only through
      the lamp of crystal that the light will shine duly out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is more likely that the stars should err," returned the Englishman,
      "than that the human heart should correct itself of error: adieu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the room, and proceeded along a passage that led to the outer
      door. Ere he reached it, another door opened suddenly, and the face of
      Lucilla broke forth upon him. She held a light in her hand; and as she
      gazed on the Englishman, he saw that her face was very pale, and that she
      had been weeping. She looked at him long and earnestly, and the look
      affected him strangely; he broke silence, which at first it appeared to
      him difficult to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, my pretty friend," said he: "shall I bring you some flowers
      to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla burst into a wild eltritch laugh; and abruptly closing the door,
      left him in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cool air of the breaking dawn came freshly to the cheek of our
      countryman; yet, still, an unpleasant and heavy sensation sat at his
      heart. His nerves, previously weakened by his long commune with the
      visionary, and the effect it had produced, yet tingled and thrilled with
      the abrupt laugh and meaning countenance of that strange girl, who
      differed so widely from all others of her years. The stars were growing
      pale and ghostly, and there was a mournful and dim haze around the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye look ominously upon me," said he, half aloud, as his eyes fixed their
      gaze above; and the excitement of his spirit spread to his language: "ye
      on whom, if our lore be faithful, the Most High hath written the letters
      of our mortal doom. And if ye rule the tides of the great deep, and the
      changes of the rolling year, what is there out of reason or nature in our
      belief that ye hold the same sympathetic and unseen influence over the
      blood and heart, which are the character (and the character makes the
      conduct) of man?" Pursuing his soliloquy of thought, and finding reasons
      for a credulity that afforded to him but little cause for pleasure or
      hope, the Englishman took his way to St. Sebastian's gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, in truth, much in the traveller's character that corresponded
      with that which was attributed and destined to one to whom the heavens had
      given a horoscope answering to his own; and it was this conviction rather
      than any accidental coincidence in events, which had first led him to pore
      with a deep attention over the vain but imposing prophecies of judicial
      astrology. Possessed of all the powers that enable men to rise; ardent,
      yet ordinarily shrewd; eloquent, witty, brave, and, though not what may be
      termed versatile, possessing that rare art of concentrating the faculties
      which enables the possessor rapidly and thoroughly to master whatsoever
      once arrests the attention, he yet despised all that would have brought
      these endowments into full and legitimate display. He lived only for
      enjoyment. A passionate lover of women, music, letters, and the arts, it
      was society, not the world, which made the sphere and end of his
      existence. Yet was he no vulgar and commonplace epicurean: he lived for
      enjoyment; but that enjoyment was mainly formed from elements wearisome to
      more ordinary natures. Reverie, contemplation, loneliness, were at times
      dearer to him than the softer and more Aristippean delights. His energies
      were called forth in society, but he was scarcely social. Trained from his
      early boyhood to solitude, he was seldom weary of being alone. He sought
      the crowd, not to amuse himself, but to observe others. The world to him
      was less as a theatre on which he was to play a part, than as a book in
      which he loved to decipher the enigmas of wisdom. He observed all that
      passed around him. No sprightly cavalier at any time; the charm that he
      exercised at will over his companions was that of softness, not vivacity.
      But amidst that silken blandness of demeanour, the lynx eye of Remark
      never slept. He penetrated character at a glance, but he seldom made use
      of his knowledge. He found a pleasure in reading men, but a fatigue in
      governing them. And thus, consummately skilled as he was in the science du
      monde, he often allowed himself to appear ignorant of its practice.
      Forming in his mind a beau ideal of friendship and of love, he never found
      enough in the realities long to engage his affection. Thus, with women he
      was considered fickle, and with men he had no intimate companionship. This
      trait of character is common with persons of genius; and, owing to too
      large an overflow of heart, they are frequently considered heartless.
      There is always, however, danger that a character of this kind should
      become with years what it seems; what it soon learns to despise. Nothing
      steels the affections like contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning an express from England reached the young traveller. His
      father was dangerously ill; nor was it expected that the utmost diligence
      would enable the young man to receive his last blessing. The Englishman,
      appalled and terror-stricken, recalled his interview with the astrologer.
      Nothing so effectually dismays us, as to feel a confirmation of some idea
      of supernatural dread that has already found entrance within our reason;
      and of all supernatural belief, that of being compelled by a predecree,
      and thus being the mere tools and puppets of a dark and relentless fate,
      seems the most fraught at once with abasement and with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman left Rome that morning, and sent only a verbal and hasty
      message to the astrologer, announcing the cause of his departure. Volktman
      was a man of excellent heart; but one would scarcely like to inquire
      whether exultation at the triumph of his prediction was not with him a far
      more powerful sentiment than grief at the misfortune to his friend!

      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE YOUTH OF LUCILLA VOLKTMAN.&mdash;A MYSTERIOUS CONVERSATION.&mdash;THE
      RETURN OF ONE UNLOOKED FOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went slowly on, and Lucilla grew up in beauty. The stranger traits of
      her character increased in strength, but perhaps in the natural
      bashfulness of maidenhood they became more latent. At the age of fifteen,
      her elastic shape had grown round and full, and the wild girl had already
      ripened to the woman. An expression of thought, when the play of her
      features was in repose, that dwelt upon her lip and forehead, gave her the
      appearance of being two or three years older than she was; but again, when
      her natural vivacity returned,&mdash;when the clear and buoyant music of
      her gay laugh rang out, or when the cool air and bright sky of morning
      sent the blood to her cheek and the zephyr to her step, her face became as
      the face of childhood, and contrasted with a singular and dangerous
      loveliness the rich development of her form.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still was Lucilla Volktman a stranger to all that savoured of the
      world; the company of others of her sex and age never drew forth her
      emotions from their resting-place:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "And Nature said, a lovelier flower
    On earth was never sown
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Myself will to my darling be
    Both law and impulse; and with me
      The girl, in rock and plain,
    In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,
    Shall feel an overseeing power
      To kindle or restrain.

    The stars of midnight shall be dear
    To her; and she shall lean her ear
      In many a secret place;
    Where rivulets dance their wayward round,
      And beauty, born of murmuring sound,
    Shall pass into her face."

                                     WORDSWORTH.
</pre>
    <p>
      These lines have occurred to me again and again, as I looked on the face
      of her to whom I have applied them. And, remembering as I do its radiance
      and glory in her happier moments, I can scarcely persuade myself to notice
      the faults and heats of temper which at times dashed away all its lustre
      and gladness. Unrestrained and fervid, she gave way to the irritation of
      grief of the moment with a violence that would have terrified any one who
      beheld her at such times. But it rarely happened that the scene had its
      witness even in her father, for she fled to the loneliest spot she could
      find to indulge these emotions; and perhaps even the agony they occasioned&mdash;an
      agony convulsing the heart and whole of her impassioned frame&mdash;took a
      sort of luxury from the solitary and unchecked nature of its indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Volktman continued his pursuits with an ardour that increased&mdash;as do
      all species of monomania&mdash;with increasing years; and in the
      accidental truth of some of his predictions, he forgot the erroneous
      result of the rest. He corresponded at times with the Englishman, who,
      after a short sojourn in England, had returned to the Continent, and was
      now making a prolonged tour through its northern capitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very different, indeed, from the astrologer's occupations were those of
      the wanderer; and time, dissipation, and a maturer intellect had cured the
      latter of his boyish tendency to studies so idle and so vain. Yet he
      always looked back with an undefined and unconquered interest to the
      period of his acquaintance with the astrologer; to their long and
      thrilling watches in the night season; to the contagious fervour of faith
      breathing from the visionary; his dark and restless excursions into that
      remote science associated with the legends of eldest time, and of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "The crew, who, under names of old renown,
    Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train,
    With monstrous shapes and sorceries, abused
    Fanatic Egypt and her priests."
</pre>
    <p>
      One night, four years after the last scene we have described in the
      astrologer's house, Volktman was sitting alone in his favourite room.
      Before him was a calculation on which the ink was scarcely dry. His face
      leant on his breast, and he seemed buried in thought. His health had been
      of late gradually declining; and it might be seen upon his worn brow and
      attenuated frame, that death was already preparing to withdraw the
      visionary from a world whose substantial enjoyments he had so sparingly
      tasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla had been banished from his chamber during the day. She now knew
      that his occupation was over, and entered the room with his evening
      repast; that frugal meal, common with the Italians&mdash;the polenta (made
      of Indian corn), the bread and the fruits, which after the fashion of
      students he devoured unconsciously, and would not have remembered one hour
      after whether or not it had been tasted!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit thee down, child," said he to Lucilla, kindly;&mdash;"sit thee down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla obeyed, and took her seat upon the very stool on which she had
      been seated the last night on which the Englishman had seen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been thinking," said Volktman, as he placed his hand on his
      daughter's head, "that I shall soon leave thee; and I should like to see
      thee protected by another before my own departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, father," said Lucilla, as the tears rushed to her eyes, "do not talk
      thus! indeed, indeed, you must not indulge in this perpetual gloom and
      seclusion of life. You promised to take me with you, some day this week,
      to the Vatican. Do let it be to-morrow; the weather has been so fine
      lately; and who knows how long it may last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said Volktman; "and to-morrow will not, I think, be unfavourable
      to our stirring abroad, for the moon will be of the same age as at my
      birth&mdash;an accident that thou wilt note, my child, to be especially
      auspicious towards any enterprise."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor astrologer so rarely stirred from his home, that he did well to
      consider a walk of a mile or two in the light of an enterprise.&mdash;"I
      have wished," continued he, after a pause, "that I might see our English
      friend once more&mdash;that is, ere long. For, to tell thee the truth,
      Lucilla, certain events happening unto him do, strangely enough, occur
      about the same time as that in which events, equally boding, will befall
      thee. This coincidence it was which contributed to make me assume so warm
      an interest in the lot of a stranger. I would I might see him soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla's beautiful breast heaved, and her face was covered with blushes:
      these were symptoms of a disorder that never occurred to the recluse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou rememberest the foreigner?" asked Volktman, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lucilla, half inaudibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not heard from him of late: I will make question concerning him
      ere the cock crow."

    <p>
      "Nay my father!" said Lucilla, quickly: "not tonight: you want rest, your
      eyes are heavy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girl," said the mystic, "the soul sleepeth not, nor wanteth sleep: even
      as the stars, to which (as the Arabian saith) there is also a soul,
      wherewith an intent passion of our own doth make a union&mdash;so that we,
      by an unslumbering diligence, do constitute ourselves a part of the heaven
      itself!&mdash;even, I say, as the stars may vanish from the human eye, nor
      be seen in the common day&mdash;though all the while their course is
      stopped not, nor their voices dumb&mdash;even so doth the soul of man
      retire, as it were, into a seeming sleep and torpor, yet it worketh all
      the same&mdash;and perhaps with a less impeded power, in that it is more
      free from common obstruction and trivial hindrance. And if I purpose to
      confer this night with the 'Intelligence' that ruleth earth and earth's
      beings, concerning this stranger, it will not be by the vigil and the
      scheme, but by the very sleep which thou imaginest, in thy mental
      darkness, would deprive me of the resources of my art."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you really, then, my father," said Lucilla, in a tone half anxious,
      half timid,&mdash;"can you really, at will, conjure up in your dreams the
      persons you wish to see; or draw, from sleep, any oracle concerning their
      present state?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of a surety," answered the astrologer; "it is one of the great&mdash;though
      not perchance the most gifted&mdash;of our endowments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you teach me the method?" asked Lucilla, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that relates to the art I can," rejoined the mystic: "but the chief
      and main power rests with thyself. For know, my daughter, that one who
      seeks the wisdom that is above the earth must cultivate and excite, with
      long labour and deep thought, his least earthly faculty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the visionary, observing that the countenance of Lucilla was stamped
      with a fixed attention, which she did not often bestow upon his
      metaphysical exordiums; paused for a moment; and then pursued the theme
      with the tone of one desirous of making himself at once as clear and
      impressive as the nature of an abstruse science would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are two things in the outer creation, which, according to the great
      Hermes, suffice for the operation of all that is wonderful and glorious&mdash;Fire
      and Earth. Even so, my child, there are in the human mind two powers that
      affect all of which our nature is capable&mdash;reason and imagination.
      Now mankind,&mdash;less wise in themselves than in the outer world&mdash;have
      cultivated, for the most part, but one of these faculties; and that the
      inferior and more passive, reason. They have tilled the earth of the human
      heart, but suffered its fire to remain dormant, or waste itself in chance
      and frivolous directions. Hence the insufficiency of human knowledge.
      Inventions founded only on reason move within a circle from which their
      escape is momentary and trivial. When some few, endowed with a just
      instinct, have had recourse to the diviner element, imagination, thou wilt
      observe, that they have used it only in the service of the lighter arts,
      and those chiefly disconnected from reason. Such is poetry and music, and
      other delicious fabrications of genius, that amuse men, soften men, but <i>advance</i>
      them not. They have&mdash;with but rare exceptions&mdash;left this
      glorious and winged faculty utterly passive in the service of Philosophy.
      There, reason alone has been admitted, and imagination hath been carefully
      banished, as an erratic and deceitful meteor. Now mark me, child: I,
      noting this our error in early youth, did resolve to see what might be
      effected by the culture of this renounced and maltreated element; and
      finding, as I proceeded in the studies that grew from this desire, by the
      occult yet guiding writings of the great philosophers of old, that they
      had forestalled me in this discovery, I resolved to learn, from their
      experience, by what means the imagination is best fostered, and, as it
      were, sublimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anxiously following their precepts&mdash;the truth of which soon appeared&mdash;I
      found that solitude, fast, intense reverie upon the one theme on which we
      desired knowledge, were the true elements and purifiers of this glorious
      faculty. It was by these means, and by this power, that men so far behind
      us in lesser lore achieved, on the mooned plains of Chaldea and by the
      dark waters of Egypt, their penetration into the womb of Event;&mdash;by
      these means, and this power, the solitaries of the Gothic time not only
      attained to the most intricate arcana of the stars, but to the empire of
      the spirits about, above, and beneath the earth; a power, indeed, disputed
      by the presumptuous sophists of the present time, but of which their
      writings yet contain ample proof. Nay, by the constant feeding, and
      impressing and moulding, and refining, and heightening, the imaginative
      power, I do conceive that even the false prophets and the evil
      practitioners of the blacker cabala clomb into the power seemingly
      inconceivable&mdash;the power of accomplishing miracles and prodigies, and
      to appearance belie, but in truth verify, the course of nature. By this
      spirit within the flesh, we grow <i>from</i> the flesh, and may see, and
      at length invoke, the souls of the dead, and receive warnings, and hear
      omens, and girdle our sleep with dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unto me," continued the cabalist, in a lowlier tone, "have been
      vouchsafed all these gifts; for I began the art when the first fire of
      youth was dim within me; and it was therefore with duller and already
      earth-clogged pinions that I sought to rise. Something, however, I have
      won as a recompense for austere abstinence and much labour; and this power
      over the land of dreams is at least within my command."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Lucilla, in a disappointed tone, "it is only by a long course
      of indulgence to the fervour of the imagination, and not by spell or
      charm, that one can gain a similar power?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not wholly so, my daughter," replied the mystic; "they who do so excite,
      and have so raised the diviner faculty, can alone possess the certain and
      invariable power over dreams, even without charms and talismans; but the
      most dull or idle may hope to do so with just confidence (though not
      certainty) by help of skill, and by directing the full force of their
      half-roused fancy towards the person or object they wish to see reflected
      in the glass of Sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what means should the uninitiated employ?" asked Lucilla, in a tone
      betokening her interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell thee," answered the astrologer. "Thou must inscribe on a
      white parchment an image of the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As how?" interrupted Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus!" said the astrologer, drawing from among his papers one inscribed
      with the figure of a man asleep on the bosom of an angel. "This was made
      at the potential and appointed time, when the sun was in the Ninth of the
      Celestial Houses, and the Lion shook his bright mane as he ascended the
      blue mount. Observe, that on the figure must be written thy desire&mdash;the
      name of the person thou wishest to see, or the thing thou wouldst have
      foreshown: then having prepared and brought the mind to a faith in the
      effect&mdash;for without faith the imagination lies inert and lifeless&mdash;this
      image will be placed under the head of the invoker, and when the moon
      goeth through the sign which was in the Ninth House of his nativity, the
      Dream will glide into him, and his soul walk with the spirit of the
      vision."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me the image," said Lucilla, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystic hesitated&mdash;"No, Lucilla," said he, at length; "no, it is a
      dark and comfortless path, that of prescience and unearthly knowledge,
      save to the few that walk it with a gifted light and a fearless soul. It
      is not for women or children&mdash;nay, for few amongst men: it withers up
      the sap of life, and makes the hair grey before its time. No, no; take the
      broad sunshine, and the brief but sweet flowers of earth; they are better
      for thee, my child, and for thy years than the fever and hope of the
      night-dream and the planetary influence."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the astrologer replaced the image within the leaves of one of
      his books; and with prudence not common to him, thrust the volume into a
      drawer, which he locked. The fair face of Lucilla became clouded, but the
      ill health of her father imposed a restraint on her wild temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment the door slowly opened, and the Englishman stood
      before the daughter and sire. They did not note him at first. The solitary
      servant of the sage had admitted him; he had proceeded, without ceremony,
      to the well-remembered apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he now stood gazing on the pair, he observed with an inward smile, how
      exactly their present attitudes (as well as the old aspect of the scene)
      resembled those in which he had broken upon them on the last evening he
      had visited that chamber; the father bending over the old, worn, quaint,
      table; and the daughter seated beside him on the same low stool. The
      character of their countenances struck him, too, as wearing the same
      ominous expression as when those countenances had chilled him on that
      evening. For Volktman's features were impressed with the sadness that
      breathed from, and caused, his prohibition to his daughter; and that
      prohibition had given to her features an abstraction and shadow similar to
      the dejection they had worn on the night we recur to.
    </p>
    <p>
      This remembered coincidence did not cheer the spirits of the young
      traveller; he muttered to himself; and then, as if anxious to break the
      silence, moved forward with a heavy step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Volktman started at the sound; and looking up, seemed literally
      electrified by this sudden apparition of one whom he had so lately
      expressed his desire to see. His lips muttered the intruder's name, one
      well known to the reader (it was the name of Godolphin) and then closed;
      but Lucilla sprang from her seat, and, clasping her hands joyously
      together, darted forward till she came within a foot of the unexpected
      visitor. There she abruptly arrested herself, blushed deeply, and stood
      before him humbled, agitated, but all vivid with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, is this Lucilla?" said Godolphin admiringly: "how beautiful she is
      grown!" and advancing, he saluted, with a light and fraternal kiss, her
      girlish and damask cheek: then, without heeding her confusion, he turned
      to the astrologer, who by this time had a little recovered from his amaze.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE EFFECT OF YEARS AND EXPERIENCE.&mdash;THE ITALIAN CHARACTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Godolphin now came almost daily to the astrologer's abode. He was shocked
      to perceive the physical alteration four years had wrought in his singular
      friend; and, with the warmth of a heart naturally kind, he sought to
      contribute to the comfort and enjoyment of a life that was evidently
      drawing to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin's company seemed to give Volktman a pleasure which nothing else
      could afford him. He loved to converse on the various incidents that had
      occurred to each since they met; and, in whatsoever Godolphin communicated
      to him, the mystic sought to impress upon his friend's attention the
      fulfilment of an astrological prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, though no longer impressed with a belief in the visionary's
      science, did not affect to combat his assertions. He had not, in his
      progress through life, found much to shake his habitual indolence in
      ordinary affairs; and it was no easy matter to provoke one of his quiet
      temper and self-indulging wisdom into conversational dispute. Besides, who
      argues with fanaticism?
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the young idealist had left England, the elements of his character
      had been slowly performing the ordination of time, and working their due
      change in its general aspect. The warm fountains of youth flowed not so
      freely as before the selfishness that always comes, sooner or later, to
      solitary men of the world, had gradually mingled itself with all the
      channels of his heart. The brooding and thoughtful disposition of his
      faculties having turned from romance to what he deemed philosophy, that
      which once was enthusiasm had hardened into wisdom. He neither hated men
      nor loved them with a sanguine philanthropy; he viewed them with cool and
      discerning eyes. He did not think it within the power of governments to
      make the mass, in any country, much happier or more elevated than they
      are. Republics, he was wont to say, favoured aristocratic virtues, and
      despotisms extinguished them: but, whether in a monarchy or republic, the
      hewers of wood and the drawers of the water, the multitude, still remained
      intrinsically the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      This theory heightened his indifference to ambition. The watchwords of
      party appeared to him ridiculous; and politics in general&mdash;what a
      great moralist termed one question in particular&mdash;a shuttlecock kept
      up by the contention of noisy children. His mind thus rested as to all
      public matters in a state of quietude, and covered over with the mantle of
      a most false, a most perilous philosophy. His appetites to pleasure had
      grown somewhat dulled by experience, but he was as yet neither sated nor
      discontented. One feeling at his breast still remained scarcely diminished
      of its effect, when the string was touched&mdash;his tender remembrance of
      Constance; and this had prevented any subsequent but momentary attachment
      deepening into love. Thus, at the age of seven and twenty, Percy Godolphin
      reappears on our stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal in the Italian character that our traveller liked:
      its love of ease, reduced into a system; its courtesy; its content with
      the world as it is; its moral apathy as regards all that agitates life,
      save one passion&mdash;and the universal tenderness, ardour, and delicacy
      which, in that passion, it ennobles itself in displaying. The commonest
      peasant of Rome or Naples, though not perhaps in the freer land of
      Tuscany, can comprehend all the romance and mystery of the most subtle
      species of love; all that it requires in England the idle habits of
      aristocracy, or the sensitive fibre of genius, even to conceive. And what
      is yet stranger, the worn-out debauches, sage with an experience and
      variety of licentiousness, which come not within the compass of a northern
      profligacy, remains alive to the earliest and most innocent sentiments of
      the passion. And if Platonism in its coldest purity exist on earth, it is
      among the Aretins of southern Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unworldly refinement, amidst so much worldly callousness, was a
      peculiarity that afforded perpetual amusement to the nice eye and subtle
      judgment of Godolphin. He loved not to note the common elements of
      character; whatever was most abstract and difficult to analyse, pleased
      him most. He mixed then much with the Romans, and was a favourite amongst
      them; but, during his present visit to the Immortal City, he did not, how
      distantly soever, associate with the English. His carelessness of show,
      and the independence of a single man from burdensome connexions, rendered
      his income fully competent to his wants; but, like many proud men, he was
      not willing to make it seem even to himself, as a comparative poverty,
      beside the lavish expenses of his ostentatious countrymen. Travel,
      moreover, had augmented those stores of reflection which rob solitude of
      ennui.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MAGNETISM.&mdash;SYMPATHY.&mdash;THE RETURN OF ELEMENTS TO ELEMENTS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Daily did the health of Volktman decline; Lucilla was the only one
      ignorant of his danger. She had never seen the gradual approaches of
      death: her mother's abrupt and rapid illness made the whole of her
      experience of disease. Physicians and dark rooms were necessarily coupled
      in her mind with all graver maladies; and as the astrologer, wrapt in his
      calculations, altered not any of his habits, and was insensible to pain,
      she fondly attributed his occasional complaints to the melancholy induced
      by seclusion. With sedentary men, diseases being often those connected
      with the Organisation of the heart, do not usually terminate suddenly: it
      was so with Volktman.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he was alone with Godolphin, and their conversation turned upon
      one of the doctrines of the old Magnetism, a doctrine which, depending as
      it does so much upon a seeming reference to experience, survived the rest
      of its associates, and is still not wholly out of repute among the wild
      imaginations of Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the most remarkable and abstruse points in what students call
      metaphysics," said Volktman, "is sympathy! the first principle, according
      to some, of all human virtue. It is this, say they, which makes men just,
      humane, charitable. When one who has never heard of the duty of assisting
      his neighbour, sees another drowning, he plunges into the water and saves
      him. Why? because involuntarily, and at once, his imagination places
      himself in the situation of the stranger: the pain he would experience in
      the watery death glances across him: from this pain he hastens,&mdash;without
      analysing its cause, to deliver himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humanity is thus taught him by sympathy: where is this sympathy placed?&mdash;in
      the nerves: the nerves are the communicants with outward nature; the more
      delicate the nerves, the finer the sympathies; hence, women and children
      are more alive to sympathy than men. Well, mark me: do not these nerves
      have attraction and sympathy&mdash;-not only with human suffering, but
      with the powers of what is falsely termed inanimate nature? Do not the
      wind, the influences of the weather and the seasons, act confessedly upon
      them? and if one part of nature, why not another, inseparably connected
      too with that part? If the weather and seasons have sympathy with the
      nerves, why not the moon and the stars, by which the weather and the
      seasons are influenced and changed? Ye of the schools may allow that
      sympathy originates some of our actions; I say it governs the whole world&mdash;the
      whole creation! Before the child is born, it is this secret affinity which
      can mark and stamp him with the witness of his mother's terror or his
      mother's desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet," said Godolphin, "you would scarcely, in your zeal for sympathy,
      advocate the same cause as Edricius Mohynnus, who cured wounds by a
      powder, not applied to the wound, but to the towel that had been dipped in
      its blood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered Volktman: "it is these quacks and pretenders that have
      wronged all sciences, by clamouring for false deductions. But I do believe
      of sympathy, that it has a power to transport ourselves out of the body
      and reunite us with the absent. Hence, trances, and raptures, in which the
      patient, being sincere, will tell thee, in grave earnestness, and with
      minute detail, of all that he saw, and heard, and encountered, afar off,
      in other parts of the earth, or even above the earth. As thou knowest the
      accredited story of the youth, who, being transported with a vehement and
      long-nursed desire to see his mother, did, through that same desire,
      become as it were rapt, and beheld her, being at the distance of many
      miles, and giving and exchanging signs of their real and bodily
      conference."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin turned aside to conceal an involuntary smile at this grave
      affirmation; but the mystic, perhaps perceiving it, continued yet more
      eagerly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I myself, at times, have experienced such trance, if trance it be;
      and have conversed with them who have passed from the outward earth&mdash;with
      my father and my wife. And," continued he, after a moment's pause, "I do
      believe that we may, by means of this power of attraction&mdash;this
      elementary and all-penetrative sympathy, pass away, in our last moments,
      at once into the bosom of those we love. For, by the intent and rapt
      longing to behold the Blest and to be amongst them, we may be drawn
      insensibly into their presence, and the hour being come when the affinity
      between the spirit and the body shall be dissolved, the mind and desire,
      being so drawn upward, can return to earth no more. And this sympathy,
      refined and extended, will make, I imagine, our powers, our very being, in
      a future state. Our sympathy being only, then, with what is immortal, we
      shall partake necessarily of that nature which attracts us; and the body
      no longer clogging the intenseness of our desires, we shall be able by a
      wish to transport ourselves wheresoever we please,&mdash;from star to
      star, from glory to glory, charioted and winged by our wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin did not reply, for he was struck with the growing paleness of
      the mystic, and with a dreaming and intent fixedness that seemed creeping
      over his eyes, which were usually bright and restless. The day was now
      fast declining, Lucilla entered the room, and came caressingly to her
      father's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the evening warm, my child?" said the astrologer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very mild and warm," answered Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your arm then," said he; "I will sit a little while without the
      threshold."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Romans live in flats, as at Edinburgh, and with a common stair.
      Volktman's abode was in the secondo piano. He descended the stairs with a
      step lighter than it had been of late; and sinking into a seat without the
      house, seemed silently and gratefully to inhale the soft and purple air of
      an Italian sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the sun had entirely vanished: and that most brief but most
      delicious twilight, common to the clime, had succeeded. Veil-like and
      soft, the mist that floats at that hour between earth and heaven, lent its
      transparent shadow to the scene around them: it seemed to tremble as for a
      moment, and then was gone. The moon arose, and cast its light over
      Volktman's earnest countenance,&mdash;over the rich bloom and watchful eye
      of Lucilla,&mdash;over the contemplative brow and motionless figure of
      Godolphin. It was a group of indefinable interest: the Earth was so still,
      that the visionary might well have fancied it had hushed itself, to drink
      within its quiet heart the voices of that Heaven in whose oracles he
      believed. Not one of the group spoke,&mdash;the astrologer's mind and gaze
      were riveted above; and neither of his companions wished to break the
      meditations of the old and dreaming man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, with folded arms and downcast eyes, was pursuing his own
      thoughts; and Lucilla, to whom Godolphin's presence was a subtle and
      subduing intoxication, looked indeed upward to the soft and tender
      heavens, but with the soul of the loving daughter of earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, nor marked by his companions, the gaze of the mystic deepened and
      deepened in its fixedness.

    <p>
      The minutes went on; and the evening waned, till a chill breeze, floating
      down from the Latian Hills, recalled Lucilla's attention to her father.
      She covered him tenderly with her own mantle, and whispered gently in his
      ear her admonition to shun the coldness of the coming night. He did not
      answer; and on raising her voice a little higher, with the same result,
      she looked appealingly to Godolphin. He laid his hand on Volktman's
      shoulder; and, bending forward to address him,&mdash;was struck dumb by
      the glazed and fixed expression of the mystic's eyes. The certainty
      flashed across him; he hastily felt Volktman's pulse&mdash;it was still.
      There was no doubt left on his mind; and yet the daughter, looking at him
      all the while, did not even dream of this sudden and awful stroke. In
      silence, and unconsciously, the strange and solitary spirit of the mystic
      had passed from its home&mdash;in what exact instant of time, or by what
      last contest of nature, was not known.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A SCENE.&mdash;LUCILLA'S STRANGE CONDUCT-GODOLPHIN PASSES THROUGH A SEVERE
      ORDEAL.&mdash;EGERIA'S GROTTO, AND WHAT THERE HAPPENS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pass over Godolphin's most painful task. What Lucilla's feelings
      were, the reader may imagine; and yet, her wayward and unanalysed temper
      mocked at once imagination and expression to depict its sufferings or its
      joys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother of Volktman's wife was sent for: he and his wife took
      possession of the abode of death. This, if possible, heightened Lucilla's
      anguish. The apathetic and vain character of the middle classes in Rome,
      which her relations shared, stung her heart by contrasting its own
      desolate abandonment to grief. Above all, she was revolted by the
      unnatural ceremonies of a Roman funeral. The corpse exposed&mdash;the
      cheeks painted&mdash;the parading procession, all shocked the delicacy of
      her real and reckless affliction. But when this was over&mdash;when the
      rite of death was done, and when, in the house wherein her sire had
      presided, and she herself had been left to a liberty wholly unrestricted,
      she saw strangers (for such comparatively her relatives were to her)
      settling themselves down, with vacant countenances and light words, to the
      common occupations of life,&mdash;when she saw them move, alter (nay, talk
      calmly, and sometimes with jests, of selling), those little household
      articles of furniture which, homely and worn as they were, were hallowed
      to her by a thousand dear, and infantine, and filial recollections;&mdash;when,
      too, she found herself treated as a child, and, in some measure, as a
      dependant,&mdash;when she, the wild, the free, saw herself subjected to
      restraint&mdash;nay, heard the commonest actions of her life chidden and
      reproved,&mdash;when she saw the trite and mean natures which thus
      presumed to lord it over her, and assume empire in the house of one, of
      whose wild and lofty, though erring speculations&mdash;of whose generous
      though abstract elements of character, she could comprehend enough to
      respect, while what she did not comprehend heightened the respect into
      awe;&mdash;then, the more vehement and indignant passions of her mind
      broke forth! her flashing eye, her scornful gesture, her mysterious
      threat, and her open defiance, astonished always, sometimes amused, but
      more often terrified, the apathetic and superstitious Italians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, moved by interest and pity for the daughter of his friend,
      called once or twice after the funeral at the house; and commended, with
      promises and gifts, the desolate girl to the tenderness and commiseration
      of her relations. There is nothing an Italian will not promise, nothing he
      will not sell; and Godolphin thus purchased, in reality, a forbearance to
      Lucilla's strange temper (as it was considered) which otherwise,
      assuredly, would not have been displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than a month had elapsed since the astrologer's decease; and, the
      season of the malaria verging to its commencement, Godolphin meditated a
      removal to Naples. He strolled, two days prior to his departure, to the
      house on the Appia Via, in order to take leave of Lucilla, and bequeath to
      her relations his parting injunctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange and harsh face that peered forth on him through the iron
      grating of the door before he obtained admittance; and when he entered, he
      heard the sound of voices in loud altercation. Among the rest, the
      naturally dulcet and silver tones of Lucilla were strained beyond their
      wonted key, and breathed the accents of passion and disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the room whence the sounds of dispute proceeded, and the first
      face that presented itself to him was that of Lucilla. It was flushed with
      anger; the veins in the smooth forehead were swelled; the short lip
      breathed beautiful contempt. She stood at some little distance from the
      rest of the inmates of the room, who were seated; and her posture was
      erect and even stately, though in wrath: her arms were folded upon her
      bosom, and the composed excitement of her figure contrasted with the play,
      and fire, and energy of her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Godolphin's appearance, a sudden silence fell upon the conclave; the
      uncle and the aunt (the latter of whom had seemed the noisiest) subsided
      into apologetic respect to the rich (he was rich to them) young
      Englishman; and Lucilla sank into a seat, covered her face with her small
      and beautiful hands, and&mdash;humbled from her anger and her vehemence&mdash;burst
      into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is this?" said Godolphin, pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italians hastened to inform him. Lucilla had chosen to absent herself
      from home every evening; she had been seen, the last night on the Corso,&mdash;crowded
      as that street was with the young, the profligate, and the idle. They
      could not but reprove "the dear girl" for this indiscretion (Italians,
      indifferent as to the conduct of the married, are generally attentive to
      that of their single, women); and she announced her resolution to
      persevere in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this true, my pupil?" said Godolphin, turning to Lucilla: the poor
      girl sobbed on, but returned no answer. "Leave me to reprimand and
      admonish her," said he to the aunt and uncle; and they, without appearing
      to notice the incongruity of reprimand in the mouth of a man of
      seven-and-twenty to a girl of fifteen, chattered forth a Babel of
      conciliation and left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, young as he might be, was not unfitted for his task. There was
      a great deal of quiet dignity mingled with the kindness of his manner; and
      his affection for Lucilla had hitherto been so pure, that he felt no
      embarrassment in addressing her as a brother. He approached the corner of
      the room in which she sat; he drew a chair near to her; and took her
      reluctant and trembling hand with a gentleness that made her weep with a
      yet wilder vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lucilla," said he, "you know your father honoured me with his
      regard: let me presume on that regard, and on my long acquaintance with
      yourself, to address you as your friend&mdash;as your brother." Lucilla
      drew away her hand; but again, as if ashamed of the impulse, extended it
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot know the world as I do, dear Lucilla," continued Godolphin;
      "for experience in its affairs is bought at some little expense, which I
      pray that it may never cost you. In all countries, Lucilla, an unmarried
      female is exposed to dangers which, without any actual fault of her own,
      may embitter her future life. One of the greatest of these dangers lies in
      deviating from custom. With the woman who does this, every man thinks
      himself entitled to give his thoughts&mdash;his words&mdash;nay, even his
      actions, a license which you cannot but dread to incur. Your uncle and
      aunt, therefore, do right to advise your not going alone, to the public
      streets of Rome more especially, except in the broad daylight; and though
      their advice be irksomely intruded, and ungracefully couched, it is good
      in its principle, and&mdash;yes, dearest Lucilla, even necessary for you
      to follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Lucilla, through her tears, "you cannot guess what insults,
      what unkindness, I have been forced to submit to from them. I, who never
      knew, till now, what insult and unkindness were! I, who&mdash;&mdash;"
      here sobs checked her utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how, my young and fair friend, how can you mend their manners by
      destroying their esteem for you? Respect yourself, Lucilla, if you wish
      others to respect you. But, perhaps,"&mdash;and such a thought for the
      first time flashed across Godolphin&mdash;"perhaps you did not seek the
      Corso for the <i>crowd</i> but for <i>one;</i> perhaps you went there to
      meet&mdash;dare I guess the fact?&mdash;an admirer, a lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now <i>you</i> insult me!" cried Lucilla, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you for your anger; I accept it as a contradiction," said
      Godolphin. "But listen yet a while, and for give frankness. If there be
      any one, among the throng of Italian youths, whom you have seen, and could
      be happy with; one who loves you and whom you do not hate;&mdash;remember
      that I am your father's friend; that I am rich; that I can&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cruel, cruel!" interrupted Lucilla and withdrawing herself from
      Godolphin, she walked to and fro with great and struggling agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not so, then?" said Godolphin, doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir: no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucilla Volktman," said Godolphin, with a colder gravity than he had yet
      called forth, "I claim some attention from you, some confidence, nay, some
      esteem;&mdash;for the sake of your father&mdash;for the sake of your early
      years, when I assisted to teach you my native tongue, and loved you as a
      brother. Promise me that you will not commit this indiscretion any more&mdash;at
      least till we meet again; nay, that you will not stir abroad, save with
      one of your relations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! impossible!" cried Lucilla, vehemently; "it were to take away
      the only solace I have: it were to make life a privation&mdash;a curse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, Lucilla; it is to make life respectable and safe. I, on the other
      hand, will engage that all within these walls shall behave to you with
      indulgence and kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not for their kindness!&mdash;for the kindness of any one; save&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom?" asked Godolphin, perceiving she would not proceed: but as she was
      still silent, he did not press the question. "Come!" said he,
      persuasively: "come, promise, and be friends with me; do not let us part
      angrily: I am about to take my leave of you for many months.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Part!&mdash;you!&mdash;months!&mdash;O God, do not say so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, she was by his side; and gazing on him with her large
      and pleading eyes, wherein was stamped a wildness, a terror, the cause of
      which he did not as yet decipher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said she, with a faint smile: "no! you mean to frighten me, to
      extort my promise. You are not going to desert me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Lucilla, I will not leave you to unkindness; they shall not&mdash;they
      dare not wound you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say to me that you are not going from Rome&mdash;speak; quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I go in two days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let me die!" said Lucilla, in a tone of such deep despair, that it
      chilled and appalled Godolphin, who did not, however, attribute her grief
      (the grief of this mere child&mdash;a child so wayward and eccentric) to
      any other cause than that feeling of abandonment which the young so
      bitterly experience at being left utterly alone with persons unfamiliar to
      their habits and opposed to their liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought to soothe her, but she repelled him. Her features worked
      convulsively: she walked twice across the room; then stopped opposite to
      him, and a certain strained composure on her brow seemed to denote that
      she had arrived at some sudden resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldst thou ask me," she said, "what cause took me into the streets as
      the shadows darkened, and enabled me lightly to bear threats at home and
      risk abroad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Lucilla: will you tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou wast the cause!" she said, in a low voice, trembling with emotion,
      and the next moment sank on her knees before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a confusion that ill became so practised and favoured a gallant,
      Godolphin sought to raise her. "No! no!" she said; "you will despise me
      now: let me lie here, and die thinking of thee. Yes!" she continued, with
      an inward but rapid voice, as he lifted her reluctant frame from the
      earth, and hung over her with a cold and uncaressing attention: "yes! you
      I loved&mdash;I adored&mdash;from my very childhood. When you were by,
      life seemed changed to me; when absent, I longed for night, that I might
      dream of you. The spot you had touched I marked out in silence, that I
      might kiss it and address it when you were gone. You left us; four years
      passed away: and the recollection of you made and shaped my very nature. I
      loved solitude; for in solitude I saw you&mdash;in imagination I spoke to
      you&mdash;and methought you answered and did not chide. You returned&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;but
      no matter: to see you, at the hour you usually leave home; to see you, I
      wandered forth with the evening. I tracked you, myself unseen; I followed
      you at a distance: I marked you disappear within some of the proud palaces
      that never know what love is. I returned home weeping, but happy. And do
      you think&mdash;do you dare to think&mdash;that I should have told you
      this, had you not driven me mad!&mdash;had you not left me reckless of
      what henceforth was thought of me&mdash;became of me! What will life be to
      me when you are gone? And now I have said all! Go! You do not love me: I
      know it: but do not say so. Go&mdash;leave me; why do you not leave me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Does there live one man who can hear a woman, young and beautiful, confess
      attachment to him, and not catch the contagion? Affected, flattered, and
      almost melted into love himself, Godolphin felt all the danger of the
      moment but this young, inexperienced girl&mdash;the daughter of his friend&mdash;no!
      her he could not&mdash;loving, willing as she was, betray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was some moments before he could command himself sufficiently to
      answer her:&mdash;"Listen to me calmly," at length he said; "we are at
      least to each other dear friends nay, listen, I beseech you. I, Lucilla,
      am a man whose heart is forestalled&mdash;exhausted before its time; I
      have loved, deeply, and passionately: that love is over, but it has
      unfitted me for any species of love resembling itself&mdash;any which I
      could offer to you. Dearest Lucilla, I will not disguise the truth from
      you. Were I to love you, it would be&mdash;not in the eyes of <i>your</i>
      countrymen (with whom such connexions are common), but in the eyes of mine&mdash;it
      would be dishonour. Shall I confer even this partial dishonour on you? No!
      Lucilla, this feeling of yours towards me is (pardon me) but a young and
      childish phantasy: you will smile at it some years hence. I am not worthy
      of so pure and fresh a heart: but at least" (here he spoke in a lower
      voice, and as to himself)&mdash;"at least I am not so unworthy as to wrong
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go!" said Lucilla; "go, I implore you." She spoke, and stood hueless and
      motionless, as if the life (life's life was indeed gone!) had departed
      from her. Her features were set and rigid; the tears that stole in large
      drops down her cheeks were unfelt; a slight quivering of her lips only
      bespoke what passed within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" cried Godolphin, stung from his usual calm&mdash;stung from the
      quiet kindness he had sought, from principle, to assume&mdash;"can I
      withstand this trial?&mdash;I, whose dream of life has been the love that
      I might now find! I, who have never before known an obstacle to a wish
      which I have not contended against, if not conquered: and, weakened as I
      am with the habitual indulgence to temptation, which has never been so
      strong as now;&mdash;but no! I will&mdash;I will deserve this attachment
      by self-restraint, self-sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved away; and then returning, dropped on his knee before Lucilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare me!" said he in an agitated voice, which brought back all the blood
      to that young and transparent cheek, which was now half averted from him&mdash;"spare
      me&mdash;spare yourself! Look around, when I am gone, for some one to
      replace my image: thousands younger, fairer, warmer of heart, will aspire
      to your love; that love for them will be exposed to no peril&mdash;no
      shame: forget me; select another; be happy and respected. Permit me alone
      to fill the place of your friend&mdash;your brother. I will provide for
      your comforts, your liberty: you shall be restrained, offended no more.
      God bless you, dear, dear Lucilla; and believe," (he said almost in a
      whisper), "that, in thus flying you, I have acted generously, and with an
      effort worthy of your loveliness and your love."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, and hurried from the apartment. Lucilla turned slowly round as
      the door closed and then fell motionless on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Godolphin, mastering his emotion, sought the host and hostess;
      and begging them to visit his lodging that evening, to receive certain
      directions and rewards, hastily left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead of returning home, the desire for a brief solitude and
      self-commune, which usually follows strong excitement, (and which, in all
      less ordinary events, suggested his sole counsellors or monitors to the
      musing Godolphin), led his steps in an opposite direction. Scarcely
      conscious whither he was wandering, he did not pause till he found himself
      in that green and still valley in which the pilgrim beholds the grotto of
      Egeria.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was noon, and the day warm, but not overpowering. The leaf slept on the
      old trees that are scattered about that little valley; and amidst the soft
      and rich turf the wanderer's step disturbed the lizard, basking its
      brilliant hues in the noontide, and glancing rapidly through the herbage
      as it retreated. And from the trees, and through the air, the occasional
      song of the birds (for in Italy their voices are rare) floated with a
      peculiar clearness, and even noisiness of music, along the deserted haunts
      of the Nymph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene, rife with its beautiful associations, recalled Godolphin from
      his reverie. "And here," thought he, "Fable has thrown its most lovely
      enduring enchantment: here, every one who has tasted the loves of earth,
      and sickened for the love that is ideal, finds a spell more attractive to
      his steps&mdash;more fraught with contemplation to his spirit, than aught
      raised by the palace of the Caesars or the tomb of the Scipios."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus meditating, and softened by the late scene with Lucilla, (to which
      his thoughts again recurred), he sauntered onward to the steep side of the
      bank, in which faith and tradition have hollowed out the grotto of the
      goddess. He entered the silent cavern, and bathed his temples in the
      delicious waters of the fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps well that it was not at that moment Lucilla made to him her
      strange and unlooked-for confession: again and again he said to himself
      (as if seeking for a justification of his self-sacrifice), "Her father was
      not Italian, and possessed feeling and honour: let me not forget that he
      loved me!" In truth, the avowal of this wild girl; an avowal made indeed
      with the ardour&mdash;but also breathing of the innocence, the
      inexperience&mdash;of her character&mdash;had opened to his fancy new and
      not undelicious prospects. He had never loved her, save with a lukewarm
      kindness, before that last hour; but now, in recalling her beauty, her
      tears, her passionate abandonment can we wonder that he felt a strange
      beating at his heart, and that he indulged that dissolved and luxurious
      vein of tender meditation which is the prelude to all love? We must
      recall, too, the recollection of his own temper, so constantly yearning
      for the unhackneyed, the untasted; and his deep and soft order of
      imagination, by which he involuntarily conjured up the delight of living
      with one, watching one, so different from the rest of the world, and whose
      thoughts and passions (wild as they might be) were all devoted to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      And in what spot were these imaginings fed and coloured? In a spot which
      in the nature of its divine fascination could be found only beneath one
      sky, that sky the most balmy and loving upon earth! Who could think of
      love within the haunt and temple of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "That Nympholepsy of some fond despair,"
</pre>
    <p>
      and not feel that love enhanced, deepened, modulated, into at once a dream
      and a desire?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long that Godolphin indulged himself in recalling the image of
      Lucilla; but nerved at length and gradually, by harder, and we may hope
      better, sentiments than those of a love which he could scarcely indulge
      without criminality on the one hand, or, what must have appeared to the
      man of the world, derogatory folly on the other; he turned his thoughts
      into a less voluptuous channel, and prepared, though with a reluctant
      step, to depart homewards. But what was his amaze, his confusion, when, on
      reaching the mouth of the cave, he saw within a few steps of him Lucilla
      herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was walking alone and slowly, her eyes bent upon the ground, and did
      not perceive him. According to a common custom with the middle classes of
      Rome, her rich hair, save by a single band, was uncovered; and as her
      slight and exquisite form moved along the velvet sod, so beautiful a
      shape, and a face so rare in its character, and delicate in its
      expression, were in harmony with the sweet superstition of the spot, and
      seemed almost to restore to the deserted cave and the mourning stream
      their living Egeria.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin stood transfixed to the earth; and Lucilla, who was walking in
      the direction of the grotto, did not perceive, till she was almost
      immediately before him. She gave a faint scream as she lifted her eyes;
      and the first and most natural sentiment of the woman breaking forth
      involuntarily,&mdash;she attempted to falter out her disavowal of all
      expectation of meeting him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, indeed, I did not know&mdash;that is&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;" she
      could achieve no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this a favourite spot with you?" said he, with the vague embarrassment
      of one at a loss for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Lucilla, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, in truth, it was: for its vicinity to her home, the beauty of the
      little valley, and the interest attached to it&mdash;an interest not the
      less to her in that she was but imperfectly acquainted with the true
      legend of the Nymph and her royal lover&mdash;had made it, even from her
      childhood, a chosen and beloved retreat, especially in that dangerous
      summer time, which drives the visitor from the spot, and leaves the scene,
      in great measure, to the solitude which befits it. Associated as the place
      was with the recollection of her earlier griefs, it was thither that her
      first instinct made her fly from the rude contact and displeasing
      companionship of her relations, to give vent to the various and
      conflicting passions which the late scene with Godolphin had called forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now stood for a few moments silent and embarrassed, till Godolphin,
      resolved to end a scene which he began to feel was dangerous, said in a
      hurried tone:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, my sweet pupil!&mdash;farewell!&mdash;May God bless you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He extended his hand, Lucilla seized it, as if by impulse; and conveying
      it suddenly to her lips, bathed it with tears. "I feel," said this wild
      and unregulated girl, "I feel, from your manner, that I ought to be
      grateful to you: yet I scarcely know why: you confessed you cannot love
      me, that my affection distresses you&mdash;you fly&mdash;you desert me.
      Ah, if you felt one particle even of friendship for me, could you do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucilla, what can I say?&mdash;I cannot marry you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I wish it?&mdash;I ask thee but to let me go with thee wherever thou
      goest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" said Godolphin, gazing on her; "art thou not aware that thou
      askest thine own dishonour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla seemed surprised:&mdash;"Is it dishonour to love? They do not
      think so in Italy. It is wrong for a maiden to confess it; but that thou
      hast forgiven me. And if to follow thee&mdash;to sit with thee&mdash;to be
      near thee&mdash;bring aught of evil to myself, not thee,&mdash;let me
      incur the evil: it can be nothing compared to the agony of thy absence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up timidly as she spoke, and saw, with a sort of terror, that
      his face worked with emotions which seemed to choke his answer. "If," she
      cried passionately, "if I have said what pains thee&mdash;if I have asked
      what would give dishonour, as thou callest it, or harm, to thyself, for
      give me&mdash;I knew it not&mdash;and leave me. But if it were not of
      thyself that thou didst speak, believe that thou hast done me but a cruel
      mercy. Let me go with thee, I implore! I have no friend here: no one loves
      me. I hate the faces I gaze upon; I loathe the voices I hear. And, were it
      for nothing else, thou remindest me of him who is gone:&mdash;thou art
      familiar to me&mdash;every look of thee breathes of my home, of my
      household recollections. Take me with thee, beloved stranger!&mdash;or
      leave me to die&mdash;I will not survive thy loss!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak of your father: know you that, were I to grant what you, in
      your childish innocence, so unthinkingly request, he might curse me from
      his grave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O God, not so!&mdash;mine is the prayer&mdash;be mine the guilt, if guilt
      there be. But is it not unkinder in thee to desert his daughter than to
      protect her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great, a terrible struggle in Godolphin's breast. "What," said
      he, scarcely knowing what he said,&mdash;"what will the world think of you
      if you fly with a stranger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no world to me but thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will your uncle&mdash;your relations say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not; for I shall not hear them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; this must not be!" said Godolphin proudly, and once more
      conquering himself. "Lucilla, I would give up every other dream or hope in
      life to feel that I might requite this devotion by passing my life with
      thee: to feel that I might grant what thou askest without wronging thy
      innocence; but&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You love me then! You love me!" cried Lucilla, joyously, and alive to no
      other interpretation of his words. Godolphin was transported beyond
      himself; and clasping Lucilla in his arms he covered her cheeks, her lips,
      with impassioned and burning kisses; then suddenly, as if stung by some
      irresistible impulse, he tore himself away; and fled from the spot.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE WEAKNESS OF ALL VIRTUE SPRINGING ONLY FROM THE FEELINGS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was the evening before Godolphin left Rome. As he was entering his
      palazzo he descried, in the darkness, and at a little distance, a figure
      wrapped in a mantle, that reminded him of Lucilla;&mdash;ere he could
      certify himself, it was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering his rooms, he looked eagerly over the papers and notes on his
      table: he seemed disappointed with the result, and sat himself down in
      moody and discontented thought. He had written to Lucilla the day before,
      a long, a kind, nay, a noble outpouring of his thoughts and feelings. As
      far as he was able to one so simple in her experience, yet so wild in her
      fancy, he explained to her the nature of his struggles and his
      self-sacrifice. He did not disguise from her that, till the moment of her
      confession, he had never examined the state of his heart towards her; nor
      that, with that confession, a new and ardent train of sentiment had been
      kindled within him. He knew enough of women to be aware, that the last
      avowal would be the sweetest consolation both to her vanity and her heart.
      He assured her of the promises he had received from her relations to grant
      her the liberty and the indulgence that her early and unrestrained habits
      required; and, in the most delicate and respectful terms, he inclosed an
      order for a sum of money sufficient at any time to command the regard of
      those with whom she lived, or to enable her to choose, should she so
      desire (though he advised her not to adopt such a measure, save for the
      most urgent reasons), another residence. "Send me in return," he said, as
      he concluded, "a lock of your hair. I want nothing to remind me of your
      beauty; but I want some token of the heart of whose affection I am so
      mournfully proud. I will wear it as a charm against the contamination of
      that world of which you are so happily ignorant&mdash;as a memento of one
      nature beyond the thought of self&mdash;as a surety that, in finding
      within this base and selfish quarter of earth, one soul so warm, so pure
      as yours, I did not deceive myself, and dream. If we ever meet again, may
      you have then found some one happier than I am, and in his tenderness have
      forgotten all of me save one kind remembrance.&mdash;Beautiful and dear
      Lucilla, adieu! If I have not given way to the luxury of being beloved by
      you, it is because your generous self-abandonment has awakened within a
      heart too selfish to others a real love for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this letter Godolphin had, hour after hour, expected a reply. He
      received none&mdash;not even the lock of hair for which he had pressed. He
      was disappointed&mdash;angry, with Lucilla&mdash;dissatisfied with
      himself. "How bitterly," thought he, "the wise Saville would smile at my
      folly! I have renounced the bliss of possessing this singular and
      beautiful being; for what?&mdash;a scruple which she cannot even
      comprehend, and at which, in her friendless and forlorn state, the most
      starched of her dissolute countrywomen would smile as a ridiculous
      punctilio. And, in truth, had I fled hence with her, should I not have
      made her through out life happier&mdash;far happier, than she will be now?
      Nor would she, in that happiness, have felt, like an English girl, any
      pang of shame. <i>Here,</i> the tie would have never been regarded as a
      degradation; nor does she, recurring to the simple laws of nature, imagine
      than any one <i>could</i> so regard it. Besides, inexperienced as she is&mdash;the
      creature of impulse&mdash;will she not fall a victim to some more artful
      and less generous lover?&mdash;to some one who in her innocence will see
      only forwardness; and who, far from protecting her as I should have done,
      will regard her but as the plaything of an hour, and cast her forth the
      moment his passion is sated!&mdash;Sated! O bitter thought, that the head
      of another should rest upon that bosom now so wholly mine! After all, I
      have, in vainly adopting a seeming and sounding virtue, merely renounced
      my own happiness to leave her to the chances of being permanently rendered
      unhappy, and abandoned to want, shame, destitution, by another!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These disagreeable and regretful thoughts were, in turn, but weakly
      combated by the occasional self-congratulation that belongs to a just or
      generous act, and were varied by a thousand conjectures&mdash;now of
      anxiety, now of anger&mdash;as to the silence of Lucilla. Sometimes he
      thought&mdash;-but the thought only glanced partially across him, and was
      not distinctly acknowledged&mdash;that she might seek an interview with
      him ere he departed; and in this hope he did not retire to rest till the
      dawn broke over the ruins of the mighty and breathless city. He then flung
      himself on a sofa without undressing, but could not sleep, save in short
      and broken intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, he put off his departure till noon, still in the hope of
      hearing from Lucilla, but in vain. He could not flatter himself with the
      hope that Lucilla did not know the exact time for his journey&mdash;he had
      expressly stated it. Sometimes he conceived the notion of seeking her
      again; but he knew too well the weakness of his generous resolution; and,
      though infirm of thought, was yet virtuous enough in act not to hazard it
      to certain defeat. At length in a momentary desperation, and muttering
      reproaches on Lucilla for her fickleness and inability to appreciate the
      magnanimity of his conduct, he threw himself into his carriage, and bade
      adieu to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      As every grove that the traveller passes on that road was guarded once by
      a nymph, so now it is hallowed by a memory. In vain the air, heavy with
      death, creeps over the wood, the rivulet, and the shattered tower;&mdash;the
      mind will not recur to the risk of its ignoble tenement; it flies back; it
      is with the Past! A subtle and speechless rapture fills and exalts the
      spirit. There&mdash;far to the West&mdash;spreads that purple sea, haunted
      by a million reminiscences of glory; there the mountains, with their sharp
      and snowy crests, rise into the bosom of the heavens; on that plain, the
      pilgrim yet hails the traditional tomb of the Curiatii and those immortal
      Twins who left to their brother the glory of conquest, and the shame by
      which it was succeeded: around the Lake of Nemi yet bloom the sacred
      groves by which Diana raised Hippolytus again into life. Poetry, Fable,
      History, watch over the land: it is a sepulchre; Death is within and
      around it; Decay writes defeature upon every stone; but the Past sits by
      the tomb as a mourning angel; a soul breathes through the desolation; a
      voice calls amidst the silence. Every age that bath passed away bath left
      a ghost behind it; and the beautiful land seems like that imagined clime
      beneath the earth in which man, glorious though it be, may not breathe and
      live&mdash;but which is populous with holy phantoms and illustrious
      shades.
    </p>
    <p>
      On, on sped Godolphin. Night broke over him as he traversed the Pontine
      Marshes. There, the malaria broods over its rankest venom: solitude hath
      lost the soul that belonged to it: all life, save the deadly fertility of
      corruption, seems to have rotted away: the spirit falls stricken into
      gloom; a nightmare weighs upon the breast of Nature; and over the wrecks
      of Time, Silence sits motionless in the arms of Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at Terracina, and retired to rest. His sleep was filled with
      fearful dreams; he woke, late at noon, languid and dejected. As his
      servant, who had lived with him some years, attended him in rising,
      Godolphin observed on his countenance that expression common to persons of
      his class when they have something which they wish to communicate, and are
      watching their opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Malden!" said he, "you look important this morning: what has
      happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "E&mdash;hem! Did not you observe, sir, a carriage behind us as we crossed
      the marshes? Sometimes you might just see it at a distance, in the
      moonlight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How the deuce should I, being within the carriage, see behind me? No; I
      know nothing of the carriage: what of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A person arrived in it, sir, a little after you&mdash;would not retire to
      bed&mdash;and waits you in your sitting-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A person! what person!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lady, sir,&mdash;a young lady;" said the servant, suppressing a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" ejaculated Godolphin: "leave me." The valet obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, not for a moment doubting that it was Lucilla who had thus
      followed him, was struck to the heart by this proof of her resolute and
      reckless attachment. In any other woman, so bold a measure would, it is
      true, have revolted his fastidious and somewhat English taste. But in
      Lucilla, all that might have seemed immodest arose, in reality, from that
      pure and spotless ignorance which, of all species of modesty, is the most
      enchanting, the most dangerous to its possessor. The daughter of
      loneliness and seclusion&mdash;estranged wholly from all familiar or
      female intercourse&mdash;rather bewildered than in any way enlightened by
      the few books of poetry, or the lighter letters, she had by accident read&mdash;the
      sense of impropriety was in her so vague a sentiment, that every impulse
      of her wild and impassioned character effaced and swept it away. Ignorant
      of what is due to the reserve of the sex, and even of the opinions of the
      world&mdash;lax as the Italian world is on matters of love&mdash;she only
      saw occasion to glory in her tenderness, her devotion, to one so elevated
      in her fancy as the English stranger. Nor did there&mdash;however
      unconsciously to herself&mdash;mingle a single more derogatory or less
      pure emotion with her fanatical worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own part, I think that few men understand the real nature of a
      girl's love. Arising so vividly as it does from the imagination, nothing
      that the mind of the libertine would impute to it ever (or at least in
      most rare in stances) sullies its weakness or debases its folly. I do not
      say the love is better for being thus solely the creature of imagination:
      I say only, so it is in ninety-nine out of a hundred instances of girlish
      infatuation. In later life, it is different: in the experienced woman,
      forwardness is always depravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      With trembling steps and palpitating heart, Godolphin sought the apartment
      in which he expected to find Lucilla. There, in one corner of the room,
      her face covered with her mantle, he beheld her: he hastened to that spot;
      he threw himself on his knees before her; with a timid hand he removed the
      covering from her face; and through tears, and paleness, and agitation,
      his heart was touched to the quick by its soft and loving expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wilt thou forgive me?" she faltered; "it was thine own letter that
      brought me hither. Now leave me, if thou canst!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, never!" cried Godolphin, clasping her to his heart. "It is fated,
      and I resist no more. Love, tend, cherish thee, I will to my last hour. I
      will be all to thee that human ties can afford&mdash;father, brother,
      lover&mdash;all but&mdash;&mdash;" He paused; "all but husband," whispered
      his conscience, but he silenced its voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may go with thee!" said Lucilla, in wild ecstasy: that was <i>her</i>
      only thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, when the notion of escape occurs to the insane, their insanity appears
      to cease; courage, prudence, caution, invention (faculties which they knew
      not in sounder health), flash upon and support them as by an inspiration;
      so, a new genius had seemed breathed into Lucilla by the idea of rejoining
      Godolphin. She imagined&mdash;not without justice&mdash;that, could she
      throw in the way of her return home an obstacle of that worldly nature
      which he seemed to dread she should encounter, his chief reason for
      resisting her attachment would be removed. Encouraged by this thought, and
      more than ever transported by her love since he had expressed a congenial
      sentiment: excited into emulation by the generous tone of his letter, and
      softened into yet deeper weakness by its tenderness;&mdash;she had
      resolved upon the bold step she adopted. A vetturino lived near the gate
      of St. Sebastian: she had sought him; and at sight of the money which
      Godolphin had sent her, the vetturino willingly agreed to transport her to
      whatever point on the road to Naples she might desire&mdash;nay, even to
      keep pace with the more rapid method of travelling which Godolphin
      pursued. Early on the morning of his departure, she had sought her station
      within sight of Godolphin's palazzo; and ten minutes after his departure
      the vetturino bore her, delighted but trembling, on the same road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italians are ordinarily good-natured, especially when they are paid
      for it; and courteous to females, especially if they have any suspicion of
      the influence of the belle passion. The vetturino's foresight had supplied
      the deficiencies of her inexperience: he had reminded her of the necessity
      of procuring her passport; and he undertook that all other difficulties
      should solely devolve on him. And thus Lucilla was now under the same roof
      with one for whom, indeed, she was unaware of the sacrifice she made, but
      whom, despite of all that clouded and separated their after-lot, she loved
      to the last, with a love as reckless and strong as then&mdash;a love
      passing the love of woman, and defying the common ordinances of time.

      On the blue waters that break with a deep and far voice along the rocks of
      that delicious shore, above which the mountain that rises behind Terracina
      scatters to the air the odours of the citron and the orange&mdash;on that
      sounding and immemorial sea the stars, like the hopes of a brighter world
      upon the darkness and unrest of life, shone down with a solemn but tender
      light. On that shore stood Lucilla and he&mdash;the wandering stranger&mdash;in
      whom she had hoarded the peace and the hopes of earth. Hers was the first
      and purple flush of the love which has attained its object; that sweet and
      quiet fulness of content&mdash;that heavenly, all-subduing and subdued
      delight, with which the heart slumbers in the excess of its own rapture.
      Care&mdash;the forethought of change&mdash;even the shadowy and vague
      mournfulness of passion&mdash;are felt not in those voluptuous but
      tranquil moments. Like the waters that rolled, deep and eloquent, before
      her, every feeling within was but the mirror of an all-gentle and
      cloudless heaven. Her head half-declined upon the breast of her young
      lover, she caught the beating of his heart, and in it heard all the sounds
      of what was now become to her the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still and solitary deepened around them the mystic and lovely night.
      How divine was that sense and consciousness of solitude! how, as it
      thrilled within them, they clung closer to each other! Theirs as yet was
      that blissful and unsated time when the touch of their hands, clasped
      together, was in itself a happiness of emotion too deep for words. And
      ever, as his eyes sought hers, the tears which the sensitiveness of her
      frame, in the very luxury of her overflowing heart, called forth,
      glittered in the tranquil stars a moment and were kissed away. "Do not
      look up to heaven, my love," whispered Godolphin, "lest thou shouldst
      think of any world but this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Lucilla! will any one who idly glances over this page sympathise one
      moment with the springs of thy brief joys and thy bitter sorrow? The page
      on which, in stamping a record of thee, I would fain retain thy memory
      from oblivion; that page is an emblem of thyself;&mdash;a short existence;
      confounded with the herd to which it has no resemblance, and then, amidst
      the rush and tumult of the world, forgotten and cast away for ever!

      As, after a long dream, we rise to the occupations of life, even so, with
      an awakening and more active feeling, I return from characters removed
      from the ordinary world&mdash;like Volktman(1) and his daughter&mdash;to
      the brilliant heroine of my narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a certain tone about London society which enfeebles the mind
      without exciting it; and this state of temperament, more than all others,
      engenders satiety. In classes that border upon the highest this effect is
      less evident; for in them&mdash;there is some object to contend for.
      Fashion gives them an inducement. They struggle to emulate the toga of
      their superiors. It is an ambition of trifle, it is true; but it is still
      ambition. It frets, it irritates, but it keeps them alive. The great are
      the true victims of ennui. The more firmly seated their rank, the more
      established their position, the more their life stagnates into insipidity.
      Constance was at the height of her wishes. No one was so courted, so
      adored. One after one, she had humbled and subdued all those who, before
      her marriage, had trampled on her pride&mdash;or, who after it, had
      resisted her pretensions: a look from her had become a triumph, and a
      smile conferred a rank on its receiver. But this empire palled upon her:
      of too large a mind to be satisfied with petty pleasures and unreal
      distinctions, she still felt the Something of life was wanting. She was
      not blessed or cursed (as it may be) with children, and she had no
      companion in her husband. There might be times in which she regretted her
      choice, dazzling as it had proved;&mdash;but she complained not of sorrow,
      but monotony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Political intrigue could not fill up the vacuum of which Constance daily
      complained; and of private intrigue, the then purity of her nature was
      incapable. When people have really nothing to do, they generally fall ill
      upon it; and at length, the rich colour grew faint upon Lady Erpingham's
      cheek; her form wasted; the physicians hinted at consumption, and
      recommended a warmer clime. Lord Erpingham seized at the proposition; he
      was fond of Italy; he was bored with England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very stupid people often become very musical: it is a sort of pretension
      to intellect that suits their capacities. Plutarch says somewhere that the
      best musical instruments are made from the jaw-bones of asses. Plutarch
      never made a more sensible observation. Lord Erpingham had of late taken
      greatly to operas: he talked of writing one himself; and not being a
      performer, he consoled himself by becoming a patron. Italy, therefore,
      presented to him manifold captivations&mdash;he thought of fiddling, but
      he talked only of his wife's health. Amidst the regrets of the London
      world, they made their arrangements, and prepared to set out at the end of
      the season for the land of Paganini and Julius Caesar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two nights before their departure, Lady Erpingham gave a farewell party to
      her more intimate acquaintance. Saville, who always contrived to be well
      with every one who was worth the trouble it cost him, was of course among
      the guests. Years had somewhat scathed him since he last appeared on our
      stage. Women had ceased to possess much attraction for his jaded eyes:
      gaming and speculation had gradually spread over the tastes once directed
      to other pursuits. His vivacity had deserted him in great measure, as
      years and infirmity began to stagnate and knot up the current of his
      veins; but conversation still possessed for and derived from him its
      wonted attraction. The sparkling jeu d'esprit had only sobered down into
      the quiet sarcasm; and if his wit rippled less freshly to the breeze of
      the present moment, it was coloured more richly by the glittering sands
      which rolled down from the experience that over shadowed the current. For
      the wisdom of the worldly is like the mountains that, sterile without,
      conceal within them unprofitable ore: only the filings and particles
      escape to the daylight and sparkle in the wave; the rest wastes idly
      within. The Pactolus takes but the sand-drifts from the hoards lost to use
      in the Tmolus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how," said Saville, seating himself by Lady Erpingham, "how shall we
      bear London when you are gone? When society&mdash;the everlasting draught&mdash;had
      begun to pall upon us, you threw your pearl into the cup; and now we are
      grown so luxurious, that we shall never bear the wine without the pearl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the pearl gave no taste to the wine: it only dissolved itself&mdash;idly,
      and in vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear Lady Erpingham, the dullest of us, having once seen the
      pearl, could at least imagine that we were able to appreciate the
      subtleties of its influence. Where, in this little world of tedious
      realities, can we find anything even to imagine about, when you abandon
      us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay! do you conceive that I am so ignorant of the framework of society as
      to suppose that I shall not be easily replaced? King succeeds king,
      without reference to the merits of either: so, in London, idol follows
      idol, though one be of jewels and the other of brass. Perhaps, when I
      return, I shall find you kneeling to the dull Lady A&mdash;&mdash;, or
      worshipping the hideous Lady Z&mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   "'Le temps assez souvent a rendu legitime
     Ce qui sembloit d'abord ne se pouvoir sans crime;"'
</pre>
    <p>
      answered Saville with a mock heroic air. "The fact is, that we are an
      indolent people; the person who succeeds the most with us has but to push
      the most. You know how Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, in spite of her red arms, her
      red gown, her city pronunciation, and her city connexions, managed&mdash;by
      dint of perseverance alone&mdash;to become a dispenser of consequence to
      the very countesses whom she at first could scarcely coax into a courtesy.
      The person who can stand ridicule and rudeness has only to desire to
      become the fashion&mdash;she or he must be so sooner or later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the immutability of one thing among all the changes I may witness on
      my return, at least I am certain no one still will dare to think for
      himself. The great want of each individual is, the want of an opinion! For
      instance, who judges of a picture from his own knowledge of painting? Who
      does not wait to hear what Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, or Lord &mdash;&mdash; (one
      of the six or seven privileged connoisseurs), says of it? Nay, not only
      the fate of a single picture, but of a whole school of painting, depends
      upon the caprice of some one of the self-elected dictators. The King, or
      the Duke of &mdash;&mdash;, has but to love the Dutch school and ridicule
      the Italian, and behold a Raphael will not sell, and a Teniers rises into
      infinite value! Dutch representations of candlesticks and boors are sought
      after with the most rapturous delight; the most disagreeable objects of
      nature become the most worshipped treasures of art; and we emulate each
      other in testifying our exaltation of taste by contending for the pictured
      vulgarities by which taste itself is the most essentially degraded. In
      fact, too, the meaner the object, the more certain it is with us of
      becoming the rage. In the theatre, we run after the farce; in painting, we
      worship the Dutch school; in&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Literature?" said Saville.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!&mdash;our literature still breathes of something noble; but why?
      Because books do not always depend upon a clique. A book, in order to
      succeed, does not require the opinion of Mr. Saville or Lady Erpingham so
      much as a picture or a ballet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure of that," answered Saville, as he withdrew presently
      afterwards to a card-table, to share in the premeditated plunder of a
      young banker, who was proud of the honour of being ruined by persons of
      rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another part of the rooms Constance found a certain old philosopher,
      whom I will call David Mandeville. There was something about this man that
      always charmed those who had sense enough to be discontented with the
      ordinary inhabitants of the Microcosm,&mdash;Society. The expression of
      his countenance was different from that of others: there was a breathing
      goodness in his face&mdash;an expansion of mind on his forehead. You
      perceived at once that he did not live among triflers, nor agitate himself
      with trifles. Serenity beamed from his look&mdash;but it was the serenity
      of thought. Constance sat down by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not sorry," said Mandeville, "to leave England? You, who have
      made yourself the centre of a circle which, for the varieties of its
      fascination, has never perhaps been equalled in this country? Wealth&mdash;rank&mdash;even
      wit&mdash;others might assemble round them: but none ever before convened
      into one splendid galaxy all who were eminent in art, famous in letters,
      wise in politics, and even (for who but you were ever above rivalship?)
      attractive in beauty. I should have thought it easier for us to fly from
      the Armida, than for the Armida to renounce the scene of her enchantment&mdash;the
      scene in which De Stael bowed to the charms of her conversation, and Byron
      celebrated those of her person."
    </p>
    <p>
      We may conceive the spell Constance had cast around her, when even
      philosophy (and Mandeville of all philosophers) had learned to flatter;
      but his flattery was sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said Constance, sighing, "even if your compliment were altogether
      true, you have mentioned nothing that should cause me regret. Vanity is
      one source of happiness, but it does not suffice to recompense us for the
      absence of all others. In leaving England, I leave the scene of
      everlasting weariness. I am the victim of a feeling of sameness, and I
      look with hope to the prospect of change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor thing!" said the old philosopher, gazing mournfully on a creature
      who, so resplendent with advantages, yet felt the crumpled rose-leaf more
      than the luxury of the couch. "Wherever you go the same polished society
      will present to you the same monotony. All courts are alike: men have
      change in action; but to women of your rank all scenes are alike. You must
      not look without for an object&mdash;you must create one within. To be
      happy we must render ourselves independent of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like all philosophers, you advise the impossible," said Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so? Have not the generality of your sex their peculiar object? One
      has the welfare of her children; another the interest of her husband; a
      third makes a passion of economy; a fourth of extravagance; a fifth of
      fashion; a sixth of solitude. Your friend yonder is always employed in
      nursing her own health: hypochondria supplies her with an object; she is
      really happy because she fancies herself ill. Every one you name has an
      object in life that drives away ennui, save yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have one too," said Constance, smiling, "but it does not fill up all
      the spaces of time. The intervals between the acts are longer than the
      acts themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your object religion?" asked Mandeville, simply. Constance was
      startled: the question was novel. "I fear not," said she, after a moment's
      hesitation, and with a downcast face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I thought," returned Mandeville. "Now listen. The reason why you feel
      weariness more than those around you, is solely because your mind is more
      expansive. Small minds easily find objects: trifles amuse them; but a high
      soul covets things beyond its daily reach; trifles occupy its aim
      mechanically; the thought still wanders restless. This is the case with
      you. Your intellect preys upon itself. You would have been happier if your
      rank had been less;" Constance winced&mdash;(she thought of Godolphin);
      "for then you would have been ambitious, and aspired to the very rank that
      now palls upon you." Mandeville continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You women are at once debarred from public life and yet influence it. You
      are the prisoners, and yet the despots of society. Have you talents? it is
      criminal to indulge them in public; and thus, as talent cannot be stifled,
      it is misdirected in private; you seek ascendency over your own limited
      circle; and what should have been genius degenerates into cunning. Brought
      up from your cradles to dissembling your most beautiful emotions&mdash;your
      finest principles are always tinctured with artifice. As your talents,
      being stripped of their wings are driven to creep along the earth, and
      imbibe its mire and clay; so are your affections perpetually checked and
      tortured into conventional paths, and a spontaneous feeling is punished as
      a deliberate crime. You are untaught the broad and sound principles of
      life; all that you know of morals are its decencies and forms. Thus you
      are incapable of estimating the public virtues and the public deficiencies
      of a brother or a son; and one reason why <i>we</i> have no Brutus, is
      because <i>you</i> have no Portia. Turkey has its seraglio for the person;
      but custom in Europe has also a seraglio for the mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance smiled at the philosopher's passion; but she was a woman, and
      she was moved by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said she, "in the progress of events, the state of the women
      may be improved as well as that of the men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless, at some future stage of the world. And believe me, Lady
      Erpingham, politician and schemer as you are, that no legislative reform
      alone will improve mankind: it is the social state which requires
      reformation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you asked me some minutes since," said Constance, after a pause, "if
      the object of my pursuit was religion. I disappointed but not surprised
      you by my answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: you grieved me, because, in your case, religion could alone fill the
      dreary vacuum of your time. For, with your enlarged and cultivated mind,
      you would not view the grandest of earthly questions in a narrow and
      sectarian light. You would not think religion consisted in a sanctified
      demeanour, in an ostentatious almsgiving, in a harsh judgment of all
      without the pale of your opinions. You would behold in it a benign and
      harmonious system of morality, which takes from ceremony enough not to
      render it tedious but impressive. The school of the Bayles and Voltaires
      is annihilated. Men begin now to feel that to philosophise is not to
      sneer. In Doubt, we are stopped short at every outlet beyond the Sensual.
      In Belief lies the secret of all our valuable exertion. Two sentiments are
      enough to preserve even the idlest temper from stagnation&mdash;a desire
      and a hope. What then can we say of the desire to be useful, and the hope
      to be immortal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was language Constance had not often heard before, nor was it
      frequent on the lips of him who now uttered it. But an interest in the
      fate and happiness of one in whom he saw so much to admire, had made
      Mandeville anxious that she should entertain some principle which he could
      also esteem. And there was a fervour, a sincerity, in his voice and
      manner, that thrilled to the very heart of Lady Erpingham. She pressed his
      hand in silence. She thought afterwards over his words; but worldly life
      is not easily accessible to any lasting impressions save those of vanity
      and love. Religion has two sources; the habit of early years, or the
      process of after thought. But to Constance had not been fated the
      advantage of the first; and how can deep thought of another world be a
      favourite employment with the scheming woman of this?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the only time that Mandeville appears in this work: a type of the
      rarity of the intervention of religious wisdom on the scenes of real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way," said Saville, as, in departing, he encountered Constance by
      the door, and made his final adieus; "by the way; you will perhaps meet,
      somewhere in Italy, my old young friend, Percy Godolphin. He has not been
      pleased to prate of his whereabout to me; but I hear that he has been seen
      lately at Naples."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance coloured, and her heart beat violently; but she answered
      indifferently, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning they set off for Italy. But within one week from that
      day, what a change awaited Constance!
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) After all, an astrologer,&mdash;nay, a cabalist&mdash;is not so
      monstrous a prodigy in the nineteenth century! In the year 1801,
      Lackingtou published a quarto, entitled <i>Magus: a Complete System of
      Occult Philosophy; treating of Alchemy, the Cabalistic Art, Natural and
      Celestial Magic,</i> &amp;c.&mdash;and a very impudent publication it is
      too. That Raphael should put forth astrological manuals is not a proof of
      his belief in the science he professes; but that it should <i>answer</i>
      to Raphael to put them forth, shows a tendency to belief in his
      purchasers.

      0 much-abused and highly-slandered passion!&mdash;passion rather of the
      soul than the heart: hateful to the pseudo-moralist, but viewed with
      favouring, though not undiscriminating eyes by the true philosopher:
      bright-winged and august ambition! It is well for fools to revile thee,
      because thou art liable, like other utilities, to abuse! The wind uproots
      the oak&mdash;but for every oak it uproots it scatters a thousand acorns.
      Ixion embraced the cloud, but from the embrace sprang a hero. Thou, too,
      hast thy fits of violence and storm; but without thee, life would
      stagnate:&mdash;-thou, too, embracest thy clouds; but even thy clouds have
      the demigods for their offspring!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the great and prevailing misfortune of Godolphin's life, that he
      had early taught himself to be superior to exertion. His talents,
      therefore, only preyed on himself; and instead of the vigorous and daring
      actor of the world, he was alternately the indolent sensualist or the
      solitary dreamer. He did not view the stir of the great Babel as a man
      with a wholesome mind should do; and thus from his infirmities we draw a
      moral. The moral is not the worse, in that it opposes the trite moralities
      of those who would take from action its motive: the men of genius, who are
      not also men of ambition, are either humourists, or visionaries, or
      hypochondriacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the side of one of the Italian lakes, Godolphin and Lucilla fixed their
      abode; and here the young idealist for some time imagined himself happy.
      Never until now so fond of nature as of cities, he gave himself up to the
      enchantment of the Eden around him. He spent the long sunny hours of noon
      on the smooth lake, or among the sheltering trees by which it was
      encircled. The scenes he had witnessed in the world became to him the food
      of quiet meditation, and for the first time in his life, thought did not
      weary him with its sameness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his steps turned homeward, the anxious form of Lucilla waited for
      him: her eye brightened at his approach, her spirit escaped restraint and
      bounded into joy: and Godolphin, touched by her delight, became eager to
      witness it: he felt the magnet of a Home. Yet as the first enthusiasm of
      passion died away, he could not but be sensible that Lucilla was scarcely
      a companion. Her fancy was indeed lively, and her capacity acute; but
      experience had set a confined limit to her ideas. She had nothing save
      love, and a fitful temperament, upon which she could draw for
      conversation. Those whose education debars them from deriving instruction
      from things, have in general the power to extract amusement from persons:&mdash;they
      can talk of the ridiculous Mrs. So-and-so, or the absurd Mr. Blank. But
      our lovers saw no society: and thus their commune was thrown entirely on
      their internal resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was always that in the peculiar mind of Godolphin which was inclined
      towards ideas too refined and subtle even for persons of cultivated
      intellect. If Constance could scarcely comprehend the tone of his
      character, we may believe that to Lucilla he was wholly a mystery. This,
      perhaps, enhanced her love, but the consciousness of it disappointed his.
      He felt that what he considered the noblest faculties he possessed were
      unappreciated. He was sometimes angry with Lucilla that she loved only
      those qualities in his character which he shared with the rest of mankind.
      His speculative and Hamlet-like temper&mdash;(let us here take Goethe's
      view of Hamlet, and combine a certain weakness with finer traits of the
      royal dreamer)&mdash;perpetually deserted the solid world, and flew to
      aerial creations. He could not appreciate the present. Had Godolphin loved
      Lucilla as he once thought that he should love her, the beauties of her
      character would have blinded him to its defects; but its passion had been
      too sudden to be thoroughly grounded. It had arisen from the knowledge of
      her affection&mdash;-not grown step by step from the natural bias of his
      own. Between the interval of liking and possession, love (to be durable)
      should pass through many stages. The doubt, the fear, the first pressure
      of the hand, the first kiss, each should be an epoch for remembrance to
      cling to. In moments of after coolness or anger, the mind should fly from
      the sated present to the million tender and freshening associations of the
      past. With these associations the affection renews its youth. How vast a
      store of melting reflections, how countless an accumulation of the spells
      that preserve constancy, does that love forfeit, in which the memory only
      commences with possession!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the more delicate and thoughtful our nature, the more powerful are
      these associations. Do they not constitute the immense difference between
      the love and the intrigue? All things that savour of youth make our most
      exquisite sensations, whether to experience, or recall:&mdash;thus, in the
      seasons of the year, we prize the spring; and in the effusions of the
      heart, the courtship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful, too, and tender&mdash;wild and fresh in her tenderness&mdash;as
      Lucilla was, there was that in her character, in addition to her want of
      education, which did not wholly accord with Godolphin's preconception of
      the being his fancy had conjured up. His calm and profound nature desired
      one in whom he could not only confide, but, as it were, repose. Thus one
      great charm that had attracted him to Constance was the evenness and
      smoothness of her temper. But the self-formed mind of Lucilla was ever in
      a bright, and to him a wearying, agitation;&mdash;tears and smiles
      perpetually chased each other. Not comprehending his character, but
      thinking only and wholly of him, she distracted herself with conjectures
      and suspicions, which she was too ingenious and too impassioned to
      conceal. After watching him for hours, she would weep that he did not turn
      from his books or his reverie to search also for her, with eyes equally
      yearning and tender as her own. The fear in absence, the absorbed devotion
      when present, that absolutely made her existence&mdash;she was wretched
      because he did not reciprocate with the same intensity of soul. She could
      conceive nothing of love but that which she felt herself; and she saw,
      daily and hourly, that in that love he did not sympathise; and therefore
      she embittered her life by thinking that he did not return her affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wrong us both," said he in answer to her tearful accusations; "but
      our sex love differently from yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," she replied, "I feel that love has no varieties: there is but one
      love, but there may be many counterfeits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin smiled to think how the untutored daughter of nature had
      unconsciously uttered the sparkling aphorism of the most artificial of
      maxim-makers.(1) Lucilla saw the smile, and her tears flowed instantly.
      "Thou mockest me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou art a little fool," said Godolphin, kindly, and he kissed away the
      storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was ever an easy matter. There was nothing unfeminine or sullen
      in Lucilla's irregulated moods; a kind word&mdash;a kind caress&mdash;allayed
      them in an instant, and turned the transient sorrow into sparkling
      delight. But they who know how irksome is the perpetual trouble of
      conciliation to a man meditative and indolent like Godolphin, will
      appreciate the pain that even her tenderness occasioned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There in one thing very noticeable in women when they have once obtained
      the object of their life&mdash;the sudden check that is given to the
      impulses of their genius!&mdash;Content to have found the realisation of
      their chief hope, they do not look beyond to other but lesser objects, as
      they had been wont to do before. Hence we see so many who, before
      marriage, strike us with admiration, from the vividness of their talents,
      and after marriage settle down into the mere machine. We wonder that we
      ever feared, while we praised, the brilliancy of an intellect that seems
      now never to wander from the limits of house and hearth. So with poor
      Lucilla; her restless mind and ardent genius had once seized on every
      object within their reach:&mdash;she had taught herself music; she had
      learned the colourings and lines of art; not a book came in her way, but
      she would have sought to extract from it a new idea. But she was now with
      Godolphin, and all other occupations for thought were gone; she had
      nothing beyond his love to wish for, nothing beyond his character to
      learn. He was the circle of hope, and her heart its centre; all lines were
      equal to that heart, so that they touched him. It is clear that this
      devotion prevented her, however, from fitting herself to be his companion;
      she did not seek to accomplish herself, but to study him: thus in her
      extreme love was another reason why that love was not adequately returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Godolphin felt all the responsibility that he had taken on himself. He
      felt how utterly the happiness of this poor and solitary child&mdash;for a
      child she was in character, and almost in years&mdash;depended upon him.
      He roused himself, therefore, from his ordinary selfishness, and rarely,
      if ever, gave way to the irritation which she unknowingly but constantly
      kept alive. The balmy and delicious climate, the liquid serenity of the
      air, the majestic repose with which Nature invested the loveliness that
      surrounded their home, contributed to soften and calm his mind. And he had
      persuaded Lucilla to look without despair upon his occasional although
      short absences. Sometimes he passed two or three weeks at Rome, sometimes
      at Naples or Florence. He knew so well how necessary such intervals of
      absence are to the preservation of love, to the defeat of that satiety
      which creeps over us with custom, that he had resolutely enforced it as a
      necessity, although always under the excuse of business&mdash;a plea that
      Lucilla could understand and not resist; for the word business seemed to
      her like destiny&mdash;a call that, however odious, we cannot disobey. At
      first, indeed, she was disconsolate at the absence only of two days; but
      when she saw how eagerly her lover returned to her, with what a fresh
      charm he listened to her voice or her song, she began to confess that even
      in the evil might be good.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees he accustomed her to longer intervals; and Lucilla relieved the
      dreariness of the time by the thousand little plans and surprises with
      which women delight in receiving the beloved wanderer after absence. His
      departure was a signal for a change in the house, the gardens, the arbour;
      and when she was tired with these occupations, she was not forbidden at
      least to write to him and receive his letters. Daily intoxication! and
      men's words are so much kinder when written, than they are when uttered!
      Fortunately for Lucilla, her early habits, and her strange qualities of
      mind, rendered her independent of companionship, and fond of solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often Godolphin, who could not conceive how persons without education
      could entertain themselves, taking pity on her loneliness and seclusion,
      would say,
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how, Lucilla, have you passed this long day that I have spent away
      from you?&mdash;among the woods or on the lake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lucilla, delighted to recount to him the history of her hours, would
      go over each incident, and body forth every thought that had occurred to
      her, with a grave and serious minuteness that evinced her capabilities of
      dispensing with the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner they passed somewhat more than two years: and in spite of
      the human alloy, it was perhaps the happiest period of Godolphin's life,
      and the one that the least disappointed his too exacting imagination.
      Lucilla had had one daughter, but she died a few weeks after birth. She
      wept over the perished flower, but was not inconsolable; for, before its
      loss, she had taught herself to think no affliction could be irremediable
      that did not happen to Godolphin. Perhaps Godolphin was the more grieved
      of the two; men of his character are fond of the occupation of watching
      the growth of minds; they put in practice their chimeras of education.
      Happy child, to have escaped an experiment!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the eve before one of Godolphin's periodical excursions, and it was
      Rome that he proposed to visit; Godolphin had lingered about the lake
      until the sun had set; and Lucilla, grown impatient, went forth to seek
      him. The day had been sultry, and now a sombre and breathless calm hung
      over the deepening eve. The pines, those gloomy children of the forest,
      which shed something of melancholy and somewhat of sternness over the
      brighter features of an Italian landscape, drooped heavily in the
      breezeless air. As she came on the border of the lake, its waves lay dark
      and voiceless; only, at intervals, the surf, fretting along the pebbles
      made a low and dreary sound, or from the trees some lingering songster
      sent forth a shrill and momentary note, and then again all became
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "An atmosphere without a breath, A silence sleeping there."
</pre>
    <p>
      There was a spot where the trees, receding in a ring, left some bare and
      huge fragments of stone uncovered by verdure. It was the only spot around
      that rich and luxuriant scene that was not in harmony with the soft spirit
      of the place: might I indulge a fanciful comparison, I should say that it
      was like one desolate and grey remembrance in the midst of a career of
      pleasure. On this spot Godolphin now stood alone, looking along the still
      and purple waters that lay before him. Lucilla, with a light step, climbed
      the rugged stones, and, touching his shoulder, reproached him with a
      tender playfulness for his truancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lucilla," said he, when peace was restored, "what impressions does this
      dreary and prophetic pause of nature before the upgathering of the storm,
      create in you? Does it inspire you with melancholy, or thought, or fear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see my star," answered Lucilla, pointing to a far and solitary orb,
      which hung islanded in a sea of cloud, that swept slowly and blackly
      onward:&mdash;"I see my star, and I think more of that little light than
      of the darkness around it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it will presently be buried among the clouds," said Godolphin,
      smiling at that superstition which Lucilla had borrowed from her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the clouds pass away, and the star endures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are of a sanguine nature, my Lucilla." Lucilla sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why that sigh, dearest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I am thinking how little even those who love us most know of us!
      I never tell my disquiet and sorrow. There are times when thou wouldst not
      think me too warmly addicted to hope!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what, poor idler, have you to fear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hast thou never felt it possible that thou couldst love me less?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla raised her large searching eyes, and gazed eagerly on his face;
      but in its calm features and placid brow she saw no ground for augury,
      whether propitious or evil. She turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot think, Lucilla," said Godolphin, "that you ever direct those
      thoughts of yours, wandering though they be, to the future. Do they ever
      extend to the space of some ten or twenty years?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. But one year may contain the whole history of my future."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, the clouds gathered round the solitary star to which Lucilla
      had pointed. The storm was at hand; they felt its approach, and turned
      homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something more than ordinarily fearful in the tempests that visit
      those soft and garden climes. The unfrequency of such violent changes in
      the mood of nature serves to appal us as with an omen; it is like a sudden
      affliction in the midst of happiness&mdash;or a wound from the hand of one
      we love. For the stroke for which we are not prepared we have rather
      despondency than resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they reached their home, the heavy rain-drops began to fall. They stood
      for some minutes at the casement, watching the coruscations of the
      lightning as it played over the black and heavy waters of the lake.
      Lucilla, whom the influences of nature always strangely and mysteriously
      affected, clung pale and almost trembling to Godolphin; but even in her
      fear there was delight in being so near to him in whose love alone she
      thought there was protection. Oh what luxury so dear to a woman as is the
      sense of dependence! Poor Lucilla! it was the last evening she ever spent
      with one whom she worshipped so entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin remained up longer than Lucilla. When he joined her in her room,
      the storm had ceased; and he found her standing by the open window, and
      gazing on the skies that were now bright and serene. Far in the deep
      stillness of midnight crept the waters of the lake, hushed once more into
      silence, and reflecting the solemn and unfathomable stars. That chain of
      hills, which but to name, awakens countless memories of romance, stretched
      behind&mdash;their blue and dim summits melting into the skies, and over
      one higher than the rest, paused the new risen moon, silvering the first
      beneath, and farther down, breaking with one long and yet mellower track
      of light over the waters of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Godolphin approached he did so, unconsciously, with a hushed and
      noiseless step. There is something in the quiet of nature like worship; it
      is as if, from the breathless heart of Things, went up a prayer or a
      homage to the Arch-Creator. One feels subdued by a stillness so utter and
      so august; it extends itself to our own sensations, and deepens into an
      awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both, then, looked on in silence, indulging it may be different thoughts.
      At length, Lucilla said softly:&mdash;"Tell me, hast thou really no faith
      in my father's creed? Are the stars quite dumb? Is there no truth in their
      movements, no prophecy in their lustre?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lucilla, reason and experience tell us that the astrologers nurse a
      dream that has no reality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reason! well!&mdash;Experience!&mdash;why, did not thy father's mortal
      illness hurry thee from home at the very time in which mine foretold thy
      departure and its cause? I was then but a child; yet I shall never forget
      the paleness of thy cheek when my father uttered his prediction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, too, was almost a child then, Lucilla."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that prediction was verified?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was so; but how many did Volktman utter that were never verified? In
      true science there are no chances&mdash;no uncertainties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my father," said Lucilla, unheeding the answer, "always foretold that
      thy lot and mine were to be entwined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the prophecy, perhaps, disposed you to the fact. You might never have
      loved me, Lucilla, if your thoughts had not been driven to dwell upon me
      by the prediction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay; I thought of thee before I heard the prophecy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your father foretold me, dearest&mdash;cross and disappointment in my
      love&mdash;was he not wrong? am I not blest with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla threw herself into her lover's arms, and, as she kissed him,
      murmured, "Ah, if I could make thee happy!" The next day Godolphin
      departed for Rome. Lucilla was more dejected at his departure than she had
      been even in his earliest absence. The winter was now slowly approaching,
      and the weather was cold and dreary. That year it was unusually rainy and
      tempestuous, and as the wild gusts howled around her solitary home&mdash;how
      solitary now!&mdash;or she heard the big drops hurrying down on the
      agitated lake, she shuddered at her own despondent thoughts, and dreaded
      the gloom and loneliness of the lengthened night. For the first time since
      she had lived with Godolphin she turned, but disconsolately, to the
      company of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Works of all sorts filled their home, but the spell that once spoke to her
      from the page was broken. If the book was not of love, it possessed no
      interest;&mdash;if of love, she thought the description both tame and
      false. No one ever painted love so as fully to satisfy another:&mdash;to
      some it is too florid&mdash;to some too commonplace; the god, like other
      gods, has no likeness on earth, and every wave on which the star of
      passion beams, breaks the lustre into different refractions of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      As one day she was turning listlessly over some books that had been put
      aside by Godolphin in a closet, and hoping to find one that contained, as
      sometimes happened, his comments or at least his marks&mdash;she was
      somewhat startled to find among them several volumes which she remembered
      to have belonged to her father. Godolphin had bought them after Volktman's
      death, and put them by as relics of his singular friend, and as samples of
      the laborious and selfwilled aberration of the human intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few among these works could Lucilla comprehend, for they were chiefly in
      other tongues than the only two with which she was acquainted. But some,
      among which were manuscripts by her father, beautifully written, and
      curiously ornamented (some of the chief works on the vainer sciences are
      only to be found in manuscript), she could contrive to decipher by a
      little assistance from her memory, in recalling the signs and
      hieroglyphics which her father had often explained to her, and, indeed,
      caused her to copy out for him in his calculations. Always possessing an
      untaxed and unquestioned belief in the astral powers, she now took some
      interest in reading of their mysteries. Her father, secretly, perhaps,
      hoping to bequeath his name to the gratitude of some future Hermes, had in
      his manuscripts reduced into a system many scattered theories of others,
      and many dogmas of his own. Over these, for they were simpler and easier
      than the crabbed and mystical speculations in the printed books, she more
      especially pored; and she was not sorry at finding fresh reasons for her
      untutored adoration of the stars and apparitions of the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, these bewildering researches made but a small part,
      comparatively speaking, of the occupation of her thoughts. To write to,
      and hear from, Godolphin had become to her more necessary than ever, and
      her letters were fuller and more minute in their details of love than even
      in the period of their first passion. Wouldst thou know if the woman thou
      lovest still loves thee, trust not her spoken words, her present smiles;
      examine her letters in absence, see if she dwells, as she once did, upon
      trifles&mdash;but trifles relating to thee. The things which the
      indifferent forget are among the most treasured meditations of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lucilla was not satisfied with the letters&mdash;frequent as they were&mdash;that
      she received in answer; they were kind, affectionate, but the something
      was wanting. "The best part of beauty is that which no picture can
      express." That which the heart most asks is that which no words can
      convey. Honesty&mdash;patriotism&mdash;religion&mdash;these have had their
      hypocrites for life;&mdash;but passion permits only momentary dissemblers.

      CHAPTER XXXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      GODOLPHIN AT ROME.&mdash;THE CURE FOR A MORBID IDEALISM.&mdash;HIS
      EMBARRASSMENT IN REGARD TO LUCILLA.&mdash;THE RENCONTRE WITH AN OLD
      FRIEND.&mdash;THE COLOSSEUM.&mdash;A SURPRISE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin arrived at Rome: it was thronged with English. Among them were
      some whom he remembered with esteem in England. He had grown a little
      weary of his long solitude, and he entered with eagerness into the society
      of those who courted him. He was still an object of great interest to the
      idle; and as men grow older they become less able to dispense with
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pleased to find his own importance, and he tasted the sweets of
      companionship with more gust than he had yet done. His talents, buried in
      obscurity, and uncalled for by the society of Lucilla, were now
      perpetually tempted into action, and stimulated by reward. It had never
      before appeared to him so charming a thing to shine; for, before, he had
      been sated with even that pleasure. Now, from long relaxation, it had
      become new; vanity had recovered its nice perception. He was no longer so
      absorbed as he had been by visionary images. He had given his fancy food
      in his long solitude, and with its wild co-mate; and being somewhat
      disappointed in the result, the living world became to him a fairer
      prospect than it had seemed while the world of imagination was untried.
      Nothing more confirms the health of the mind than indulging its favourite
      infirmity to its own cure. So Goethe, in his memoirs, speaking of Werther,
      remarks, that "the composition of that extravagant work cured his
      character of extravagance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin thought often of Lucilla; but perhaps, if the truth of his heart
      were known even to himself, a certain sentiment of pain and humiliation
      was associated with the tenderness of his remembrance. With her he had led
      a life, romantic, it is true, but somewhat effeminate; and he thought now,
      surrounded by the gay and freshening tide of the world, somewhat mawkish
      in its romance. He did not experience a desire to return to the still lake
      and the gloomy pines;&mdash;he felt that Lucilla did not suffice to make
      his world. He would have wished to bring her to Rome; to live with her
      more in public than he had hitherto done; to conjoin, in short, her
      society, with the more recreative dissipation of the world: but there were
      many obstacles to this plan in his fastidious imagination. So new to the
      world, its ways, its fashions, so strange and infantine in all things, as
      Lucilla was, he trembled to expose her inexperience to the dangers that
      would beset it. He knew that his "friends" would pay very little respect
      to her reserve; and that for one so lovely and unhackneyed, the snares of
      the wildest and most subtle adepts of intrigue would be set. Godolphin did
      not undervalue Lucilla's pure and devoted heart; but he knew that the only
      sure antidote against the dangers of the world is the knowledge of the
      world. There was nothing in Lucilla that ever promised to attain that
      knowledge; her very nature seemed to depend on her ignorance of the nature
      of others. Joined to this fear and a confused sentiment of delicacy
      towards her, a certain remorseful feeling in himself made him dislike
      bringing their connexion immediately before the curious and malignant
      world: so much had circumstance, and Lucilla's own self-willed temper and
      uncalculating love, contributed to drive the poor girl into his arms,&mdash;and
      so truly had he chosen the generous not the selfish part, until passion
      and nature were exposed to a temptation that could have been withstood by
      none but the adherent to sterner principles than he (the creature of
      indolence and feeling) had ever clung to&mdash;that Godolphin, viewing his
      habits&mdash;his education&mdash;his whole bias and frame of mind&mdash;the
      estimates and customs of the world&mdash;may not, perhaps be very rigidly
      judged for the nature of his tie to Lucilla. But I do not seek to excuse
      it, nor did he wholly excuse it to himself. The image of Volktman often
      occurred to him, and always in reproach. Living with Lucilla in a spot
      only trod by Italians, so indulgent to love, and where the whisper of
      shame could never reach her ear, or awaken his remorse, her state did not,
      however, seem to her or himself degraded, and the purity of her girlish
      mind almost forbade the intrusion of the idea. But to bring her into
      public&mdash;among his own countrymen&mdash;and to feel that the generous
      and devoted girl, now so unconscious of sin, would be rated by English
      eyes with the basest and most abandoned of the sex,&mdash;with the
      glorifiers in vice or the hypocrites for money,&mdash;this was a thought
      which he could not contemplate, and which he felt he would rather pass his
      life in solitude than endure. But this very feeling gave an embarrassment
      to his situation with Lucilla, and yet more fixedly combined her image
      with that of a wearisome seclusion and an eternal ennui.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the thought of Lucilla, coupled with its many embarrassments,
      Godolphin turned with avidity to the easy enjoyments of life&mdash;enjoyments
      that ask no care and dispense with the trouble of reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But among the visitors to Rome, the one whose sight gave to Godolphin the
      greatest pleasure was his old friend Augustus Saville. A decaying
      constitution, and a pulmonary attack in especial, had driven the
      accomplished voluptuary to a warmer climate. The meeting of the two
      friends was quite characteristic: it was at a soiree at an English house.
      Saville had managed to get up a whist-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, Saville, there is Godolphin, your old friend!" cried the host, who
      was looking on the game, and waiting to cut in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hist!" said Saville; "don't direct his attention to me until after the
      odd trick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this coolness when a point was in question, Saville was
      extremely glad to meet his former pupil. They retired into a corner of the
      room, and talked over the world. Godolphin hastened to turn the
      conversation on Lady Erpingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Saville, "I see from your questions, and yet more your tone of
      voice, that although it is now several years since you met, you still
      preserve the sentiment&mdash;the weakness&mdash;Ah!&mdash;bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" said Godolphin; "I owe her revenge, not love. But Erpingham? Does
      she love him? He is handsome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Erpingham? What&mdash;you have not heard&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heard what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing: but, pardon me, they wait for me at the card-table. I should
      like to stay with you, but you know one must not be selfish; the table
      would be broken up without me. No virtue without self-sacrifice&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But one moment. What is the matter with the Erpinghams? have they
      quarrelled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quarrelled?&mdash;bah! Quarrelled&mdash;no; I dare say she likes him
      better now than ever she did before." And Saville limped away to the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin remained for some time abstracted and thoughtful. At length,
      just as he was going away, Saville, who, having an unplayable hand and a
      bad partner, had somewhat lost his interest in the game, looked up and
      beckoned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Godolphin, my clear fellow, I am to escort a lady to see the lions
      to-morrow; a widow&mdash;a rich widow; handsome, too. Do, for charity's
      sake, accompany us, or meet us at the Colosseum. How well that sounds&mdash;eh?
      About two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin refused at first, but being pressed, assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not surrounded by the lesser glories of modern Rome, but girt with the
      mighty desolation of the old city of Romulus, stands the most wonderful
      monument, perhaps, in the world, of imperial magnificence&mdash;the
      Flavian Amphitheatre, to which, it has been believed, the colossal statue
      of the worst of emperors gave that name (the Colosseum), allied with the
      least ennobling remembrances yet giving food to the loftiest thoughts. The
      least ennobling remembrances; for what can be more degrading than the
      amusements of a degraded people, who reserved meekness for their tyrants,
      and lavished ferocity on their shows? From that of the wild beast to that
      of the Christian martyr, blood has been the only sanctification of this
      temple to the Arts. The history of the Past broods like an air over those
      mighty arches; but Memory can find no reminiscence worthy of the spot. The
      amphitheatre was not built until history had become a record of the vice
      and debasement of the human race. The Faun and the Dryad had deserted the
      earth, no sweet superstition, the faith of the grotto and the green hill,
      could stamp with a delicate and undying spell the labours of man. Nor
      could the ruder but august virtues of the heroic age give to the tradition
      of the arch and column some stirring remembrance or exalting thought. Not
      only the warmth of fancy, but the greatness of soul was gone; the only
      triumph left to genius was to fix on its page the gloomy vices which made
      the annals of the world. Tacitus is the Historian of the Colosseum. But
      the very darkness of the past gives to the thoughts excited within that
      immense pile a lofty but mournful character. A sense of vastness&mdash;for
      which, as we gaze, we cannot find words, but which bequeaths thoughts that
      our higher faculties would not willingly forego&mdash;creeps within us as
      we gaze on this Titan relic of gigantic crimes for ever passed away from
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not only within the scene, but around the scene, what voices of old
      float upon the air? Yonder the triumphal arch of Constantine, its
      Corinthian arcades, and the history of Trajan sculptured upon its marble;
      the dark and gloomy verdure of the Palatine; the ruins of the palace of
      the Caesars; the mount of Fable, of Fame, of Luxury (the Three Epochs of
      Nations); the habitation of Saturn; the home of Tully; the sight of the
      Golden House of Nero! Look at your feet,&mdash;look around; the waving
      weed, the broken column&mdash;Time's witness, and the Earthquake's. In
      that contrast between grandeur and decay,&mdash;in the unutterable and
      awful solemnity that, while rife with the records of past ages, is sad
      also with their ravage, you have felt the nature of eternity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this vast amphitheatre, and giving way to such meditations,
      Godolphin passed on alone, the day after his meeting with Saville; and at
      the hour he had promised the latter to seek him, he mounted the wooden
      staircase which conducts the stranger to the wonders above the arena, and
      by one of the arches that looked over the still pines that slept afar off
      in the sun of noon, he saw a female in deep mourning, whom Saville
      appeared to be addressing. He joined them; the female turned round, and he
      beheld, pale and saddened, but how glorious still, the face of Constance!
      To him the interview was unexpected, by her foreseen. The colour flushed
      over her cheek, the voice sank inaudible within. But Godolphin's emotion
      was more powerful and uncontrolled: violent tremblings literally shook him
      as he stood; he gasped for breath: the sight of the dead returned to earth
      would have affected him less.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this immense ruin&mdash;in the spot where, most of earth, man feels the
      significance of an individual life, or of the rapid years over which it
      extends, he had encountered, suddenly, the being who had coloured all his
      existence. He was reminded at once of the grand epoch of his life and of
      its utter unimportance. But these are the thoughts that would occur rather
      to us than him. Thought at that moment was an intolerable flash that burst
      on him for an instant, and then left all in darkness. He clung to the
      shattered corridor for support. Constance seemed touched and surprised by
      so overwhelming an emotion, and the habitual hypocrisy in which women are
      reared, and by which they learn to conceal the sentiments they experience,
      and affect those they do not, came to her assistance and his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is many years, Mr. Godolphin," said she in a collected but soft voice,
      "since we met."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Years!" repeated Godolphin, vaguely; and approaching her with a slow and
      faltering step. "Years! you have not numbered them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saville had retired a few steps on Godolphin's arrival, and had watched
      with a sardonic yet indifferent smile the proof of his friend's weakness.
      He joined Godolphin, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must forgive me, my dear Godolphin, for not apprising you before of
      Lady Erpingham's arrival at Rome. But a delight is perhaps the greater for
      being sudden."
    </p>
    <p>
      The word Erpingham thrilled displeasingly through Godolphin's veins; in
      some measure it restored him to himself. He bowed coldly, and muttered a
      few ceremonious words; and while he was yet speaking, some stragglers that
      had belonged to Lady Erpingham's party came up. Fortunately, perhaps, for
      the self-possession of both, they, the once lovers, were separated from
      each other. But whenever Constance turned her glance to Godolphin, she saw
      those large, searching, melancholy eyes, whose power she well recalled,
      fixed unmovingly on her, as seeking to read in her cheek the history of
      the years which had ripened its beauties&mdash;for another.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      DIALOGUE BETWEEN GODOLPHIN AND SAVILLE.&mdash;CERTAIN EVENTS EXPLAINED.&mdash;SAVILLE'S
      APOLOGY FOR A BAD HEART.&mdash;GODOLPHIN'S CONFUSED SENTIMENTS FOR LADY
      ERPINGHAM.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! Constance Vernon once more free!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you not really know it? Your retreat by the lake must have been
      indeed seclusion. It is seven months since Lord Erpingham died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I dream?" murmured Godolphin, as he strode hurriedly to and fro the
      apartment of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saville, stretched on the sofa, diverted himself with mixing snuffs on a
      little table beside him. Nothing is so mournfully amusing in life as to
      see what trifles the most striking occurrences to us appear to our
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Saville, not looking up, "you seem very incurious to know how
      he died, and where. You must learn that Erpingham had two ruling passions&mdash;one
      for horses, the other for fiddlers. In setting off for Italy he expected,
      naturally enough, to find the latter, but he thought he might as well
      export the former. He accordingly filled the vessel with quadrupeds, and
      the second day after landing he diverted the tedium of a foreign clime
      with a gentle ride. He met with a fall, and was brought home speechless.
      The loss of speech was not of great importance to his acquaintance; but he
      died that night, and the loss of his life was! for he gave very fair
      dinners&mdash;ah,&mdash;bah!" And Saville inhaled the fragrance of a new
      mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saville had a very pleasant way of telling a story, particularly if it
      related to a friend's death, or some such agreeable incident. "Poor Lady
      Erpingham was exceedingly shocked; and well she might be, for I don't
      think weeds become her. She came here by slow stages, in order that the
      illustrious Dead might chase away the remembrance of the deceased."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your heart has not improved, Saville."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heart! What's that? Oh, a thing servant-maids have, and break for John
      the footman. Heart! my dear fellow, you are turned canter, and make use of
      words without meaning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin was not prepared for a conversation of this order; and Saville,
      in a somewhat more serious air, continued:&mdash;"Every person, Godolphin,
      talks about the world. The world! it conveys different meanings to each,
      according to the nature of the circle which makes his world. But we all
      agree in one thing,&mdash;the worldliness of the world. Now, no man's
      world is so void of affection as ours&mdash;the polished, the courtly, the
      great world: the higher the air, the more pernicious to vegetation. Our
      very charm, our very fascination, depends upon a certain mockery; a subtle
      and fine ridicule on all persons and all things constitutes the essence of
      our conversation. Judge if that tone be friendly to the seriousness of the
      affections. Some poor dog among us marries, and household plebeianisms
      corrupt the most refined. Custom attaches the creature to his ugly wife
      and his squalling children; he grows affectionate, and becomes out of
      fashion. But we single men, dear Godolphin, have no one to care for but
      ourselves: the deaths that happen, unlike the ties that fall from the
      married men, do not interfere with our domestic comforts. We miss no one
      to make our tea, or give us our appetite-pills before dinner. Our losses
      are not intimate and household. We shrug our shoulders and are not a whit
      the worse for them. Thus, for want of grieving, and caring, and fretting,
      we are happy enough to grow&mdash;come, I will use an epithet to please
      you&mdash;hard-hearted! We congeal into philosophy; and are we not then
      wise in adopting this life of isolation and indifference?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, wrapt in reflection, scarcely heeded the voluptuary, but
      Saville continued: he had grown to that height in loneliness that he even
      loved talking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, wise! For this world is so filled with the selfish, that he who is
      not so labours under a disadvantage. Nor are we the worse for our apathy.
      If we jest at a man's misfortune, we do not do it to his face. Why not out
      of the ill, which is misfortune, extract good, which is amusement? Three
      men in this room are made cheerful by a jest at a broken leg in the next.
      Is the broken leg the worse for it? No; but the three men are made merry
      by the jest. Is the jest wicked, then? Nay, it is benevolence. But some
      cry, 'Ay, but this habit of disregarding misfortunes blunts your wills
      when you have the power to relieve them.' Relieve! was ever such delusion?
      What can we relieve in the vast mass of human misfortunes? As well might
      we take a drop from the ocean, and cry, 'Ha, ha! we have lessened the
      sea!' What are even your public charities? what your best institutions?
      How few of the multitude are relieved at all; how few of that few relieved
      permanently! Men die, suffer, starve just as soon, and just as numerously;
      these public institutions are only trees for the public conscience to go
      to roost upon. No, my dear fellow, everything I see in the world says,
      Take care of thyself. This is the true moral of life; every one who minds
      it gets on, thrives, and fattens; they who don't, come to us to borrow
      money, if gentlemen; or fall upon the parish, if plebeians. I mind it, my
      dear Godolphin; I have minded it all my life; I am very contented&mdash;content
      is the sign of virtue,&mdash;ah,&mdash;bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; Constance was a widow. The hand of her whom Percy Godolphin had loved
      so passionately, and whose voice even now thrilled to his inmost heart,
      and awakened the echoes that had slept for years, it was once more within
      her power to bestow, and within his to demand. What a host of emotions
      this thought gave birth to! Like the coming of the Hindoo god, she had
      appeared, and lo, there was a new world! "And her look," he thought, "was
      kind, her voice full of a gentle promise, her agitation was visible. She
      loves me still. Shall I fly to her feet? Shall I press for hope? And, oh
      what, what happiness!&mdash;&mdash;but Lucilla!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This recollection was indeed a barrier that never failed to present itself
      to every prospect of hope and joy which the image of Constance coloured
      and called forth. Even for the object of his first love, could he desert
      one who had forsaken all for him, whose life was wrapt up in his
      affection? The very coolness with which he was sensible he had returned
      the attachment of this poor girl made him more alive to the duties he owed
      her. If not bound to her by marriage, he considered with a generosity&mdash;barely,
      in truth, but justice, yet how rare in the world&mdash;that the tie
      between them was sacred, that only death could dissolve it. And now that
      tie was, perhaps, all that held him from attaining the dream of his past
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absorbed in these ideas, Godolphin contrived to let Saville's
      unsympathising discourse glide unheeded along, without reflecting its
      images on the sense, until the name of Lady Erpingham again awakened his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to her this evening," said Saville; "and you may thank me
      for that; for I asked you if you were thither bound in her hearing, in
      order to force her into granting you an invitation. She only sees her most
      intimate friends&mdash;you, me, and Lady Charlotte Deerham. Widows are shy
      of acquaintance during their first affliction. I always manage, however,
      to be among the admitted&mdash;caustic is good for some wounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said Godolphin, smiling, "it is your friendly disposition that
      makes them sure of sympathy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have hit it. But," continued Saville, "do you think Madame likely to
      marry again, or shall you yourself adventure? Erpingham has left her
      nearly his whole fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      Irritated and impatient at Saville's tone, Godolphin rose. "Between you
      and me," said Saville, in wishing him goodbye, "I don't think she will
      ever marry again. Lady Erpingham is fond of power and liberty; even the
      young Godolphin&mdash;and you are not so handsome as you were&mdash;will
      find it a hopeless suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" muttered Godolphin, as he departed. But the last words of Saville
      had created a new feeling in his breast. It was then possible, nay, highly
      probable, that he might have spared himself the contest he had undergone,
      and that the choice between Lucilla and Constance might never be permitted
      him. "At all events," said he, almost aloud, "I will see if this
      conjecture be true: if Constance, yet remembering our early love, yet
      feeling for the years of secret pining which her ambition bequeathed me,
      should appear willing to grant me the atonement fate has placed within her
      power, then, then, it will be time for this self-sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      The social relations of the sex often make men villanous&mdash;they more
      often make them weak.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN EVENING WITH CONSTANCE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Constances's heart was in her eyes when she saw Godolphin that evening.
      She had, it is true, as Saville observed, been compelled by common
      courtesy to invite him; and although there was an embarrassment in their
      meeting, who shall imagine that it did not bring to Constance more of
      pleasure than pain? She had been deeply shocked by Lord Erpingham's sudden
      death: they had not been congenial minds, but the great have an advantage
      denied to the less wealthy orders. Among the former, a husband and wife
      need not weary each other with constant companionships; different
      establishments, different hours, different pursuits, allow them to pass
      life in great measure apart, so that there is no necessity for hatred, and
      indifference is the coldest feeling which custom induces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still in the prime of youth and at the zenith of her beauty, Constance was
      now independent. She was in the enjoyment of the wealth and rank her early
      habits of thought had deemed indispensable, and she now for the first time
      possessed the power of sharing them with whom she pleased. At this thought
      how naturally her heart flew back to Godolphin! And while she now gazed,
      although by stealth, at his countenance, as he sat at a little distance
      from her, and in his turn watched for the tokens of past remembrance, she
      was deeply touched by the change (light as it seemed to others) which
      years had brought to him; and in recalling the emotion he had testified at
      meeting her, she suffered her heart to soften, while it reproached her in
      whispering, "Thou art the cause!"&mdash;All the fire&mdash;the ardour of a
      character not then confirmed, which, when she last saw him spoke in his
      eye and mien, were gone for ever. The irregular brilliancy of his
      conversation&mdash;the earnestness of his air and gesture were replaced by
      a calm, and even, and melancholy composure. His forehead was stamped with
      the lines of thought; and the hair, grown thinner toward the temples, no
      longer concealed by its luxuriance the pale expanse of his brow. The air
      of delicate health which had at first interested her in his appearance,
      still lingered, and gave its wonted and ineffable charm to his low voice,
      and the gentle expression of his eyes. By degrees, the conversation, at
      first partial and scattered, became more general. Constance and Godolphin
      were drawn into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible," said Godolphin, "to compare life in a southern climate
      with that which we lead in colder countries. There is an indolence, a
      laissez aller, a philosophical insouciance, produced by living under these
      warm suns, and apart from the ambition of the objects of our own nation,
      which produce at last a state of mind that divides us for ever from our
      countrymen. It is like living amidst perpetual music&mdash;a different
      kind of life&mdash;a soft, lazy, voluptuous romance of feeling, that
      indisposes us to action&mdash;almost to motion. So far from a sojourn in
      Italy being friendly to the growth of ambition, it nips and almost
      destroys the germ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact, it leaves us fit for nothing but love," said Saville; "an
      occupation that levels us with the silliest part of our species."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fools cannot love," said Lady Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, love and folly are synonymous in more languages than the
      French," answered Saville.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In truth," said Godolphin, "the love which you both allude to is not
      worth disputing about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What love is?" asked Saville.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First love," cried Lady Charlotte; "is it not, Mr. Godolphin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin changed color, and his eyes met those of Constance. She too
      sighed and looked down: Godolphin remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Mr. Godolphin, answer me," said Lady Charlotte; "I appeal to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First love, then," said Godolphin, endeavouring to speak composedly, "has
      this advantage over others&mdash;it is usually disappointed, and regret
      for ever keeps it alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his voice struck Constance to the heart. Nor did she speak
      again&mdash;save with visible effort&mdash;during the rest of the evening.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONSTANCE'S UNDIMINISHED LOVE FOR GODOLPHIN.&mdash;HER REMORSE AND HER
      HOPE.&mdash;THE CAPITOL.&mdash;THE DIFFERENT THOUGHTS OF GODOLPHIN AND
      CONSTANCE AT THE VIEW.&mdash;THE TENDER EXPRESSIONS OF CONSTANCE.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Constance heard from others of Godolphin's life since they
      parted, increased her long-nursed interest in his fate. His desultory
      habits, his long absences from cities, which were understood to be passed
      in utter and obscure solitude (for the partner of the solitude and its
      exact spot were not known), she coupled with the quiet melancholy in his
      aspect, with his half-reproachful glances toward herself, and with the
      emotions which he had given vent to in their conversation. And of this
      objectless and unsatisfactory life she was led to consider herself the
      cause. With a bitter pang she recalled his early words, when he said, "My
      future is in your hands;" and she contrasted his vivid energies&mdash;his
      cultivated mind&mdash;his high talents&mdash;with the life which had
      rendered them all so idle to others and unprofitable to himself. Few, very
      few, know how powerfully the sentiment that another's happiness is at her
      control speaks to a woman's heart. Accustomed to dependence herself, the
      feeling that another depends on her is the most soothing aliment to her
      pride. This makes a main cause of her love to her children; they would be
      incomparably less dear to her if they were made independent of her cares.
      And years, which had brought the young countess acquainted with the
      nothingness of the world, had softened and deepened the sources of her
      affections, in proportion as they had checked those of her ambition. She
      could not, she did not, seek to disguise from herself that Godolphin yet
      loved her; she anticipated the hour when he would avow that love, and when
      she might be permitted to atone for all of disappointment that her former
      rejection might have brought to him. She felt, too, that it would be a
      noble as well as delightful task, to awaken an intellect so brilliant to
      the natural objects of its display; to call forth into active life his
      teeming thought, and the rich eloquence with which he could convey it. Nor
      in this hope were her more selfish designs, her political schemings, and
      her desire of sway over those whom she loved to humble, forgotten; but
      they made, however,&mdash;to be just,&mdash;a small part of her
      meditations. Her hopes were chiefly of a more generous order. "I refused
      thee," she thought, "when I was poor and dependent&mdash;now that I have
      wealth and rank, how gladly will I yield them to thy bidding!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Godolphin, as if unconscious of this favorable bias of her
      inclinations, did not warm from his reserve. On the contrary, his first
      abstraction, and his first agitation, had both subsided into a distant and
      cool self-possession. They met often, but he avoided all nearer or less
      general communication. She saw, however, that his eyes were constantly in
      search of her, and that a slight trembling in his voice when he addressed
      her, belied the calmness of his manner. Sometimes, too, a word, or a touch
      from her, would awaken the ill-concealed emotions&mdash;his lips seemed
      about to own the triumph of her and of the past; but, as if by a violent
      effort, they were again sealed; and not unoften, evidently unwilling to
      trust his self-command, he would abruptly depart. In short, Constance
      perceived that a strange embarrassment, the causes of which she could not
      divine, hung about him, and that his conduct was regulated by some secret
      motive, which did not spring from the circumstances that had occurred
      between them. For it was evident that he was not withheld by any
      resentment toward her from her former rejection: even his looks, his
      words, had betrayed that he had done more than forgive. Lady Charlotte
      Deerham had heard from Saville of their former attachment: she was a woman
      of the world, and thought it but common delicacy to give them all occasion
      to renew it. She always, therefore, took occasion to retire from the
      immediate vicinity of Constance whenever Godolphin approached, and, as if
      by accident, to leave them the opportunity to be sufficiently alone. This
      was a danger that Godolphin had, however, hitherto avoided. One day fate
      counteracted prudence, and a conference ensued which perplexed Constance
      and tried severely the resolution of Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went together to the Capitol, from whose height is beheld perhaps the
      most imposing landscape in the world. It was a sight pre-eminently
      calculated to arouse and inspire the ambitious and working mind of the
      young countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think," said she to Godolphin, who stood beside her, "that there
      lives any one who could behold these countless monuments of eternal glory,
      and not sigh to recall the triteness, or rather burn to rise from the
      level, of our ordinary life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said Godolphin, "to you the view may be an inspiration, to others a
      warning. The arch and the ruin you survey speak of change yet more
      eloquently than glory. Look on the spot where once was the temple of
      Romulus:&mdash;there stands the little church of an obscure saint. Just
      below you is the Tarpeian Rock: we cannot see it; it is hidden from us by
      a crowd of miserable houses. Along the ancient plain of the Campus Martins
      behold the numberless spires of a new religion, and the palaces of a
      modern race! Amidst them you see the triumphal columns of Trajan and
      Marcus Antoninus; but whose are the figures that crown their summits? St.
      Peter's and St. Paul's! And this awful wilderness of men's labours&mdash;this
      scene and token of human revolutions&mdash;inspires you with a love of
      glory; to me it proves its nothingness. An irresistible&mdash;a crushing
      sense of the littleness and brief life of our most ardent and sagacious
      achievements seems to me to float like a voice over the place!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you still, then," said Constance, with a half sigh, "dead to all
      but the enjoyment of the present moment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Godolphin, in a low and trembling voice: "I am not dead to
      the regret of the past!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance blushed deeply; but Godolphin, as if feeling he had committed
      himself too far, continued in a hurried tone:&mdash;"Let us turn our
      eyes," said he, "yonder among the olive groves. There
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    'Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,'
</pre>
    <p>
      were the summer retreats of Rome's brightest and most enduring spirits.
      There was the retirement of Horace and Mecaenas: there Brutus forgot his
      harsher genius; and there the inscrutable and profound Augustus indulged
      in those graceful relaxations-those sacrifices to wit, and poetry, and
      wisdom&mdash;which have made us do so unwilling and reserved a justice to
      the crimes of his earlier and the hypocrisy of his later years. Here,
      again, is a reproach to your ambition," added Godolphin, smiling; "his
      ambition made Augustus odious; his occasional forgetfulness of ambition
      alone redeems him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what, then," said Constance, "would you consider inactivity the
      happiest life for one sensible of talents higher than the common
      standard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, let those talents be devoted to the discovery of pleasures, not the
      search after labours; the higher our talents, the keener our perceptions;
      the keener our perceptions the more intense our capacities for
      pleasure:(1)&mdash;let pleasure then, be our object. Let us find out what
      is best fitted to give our peculiar tastes gratification, and, having
      found out, steadily pursue it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out on you! it is a selfish, an ignoble system," said Constance. "You
      smile&mdash;well, I may be unphilosophical, I do not deny it. But, give me
      one hour of glory, rather than a life of luxurious indolence. Oh, would,"
      added Constance, kindling as she spoke, "that you&mdash;you, Mr.
      Godolphin,&mdash;with an intellect so formed for high accomplishment&mdash;with
      all the weapons and energies of life at your command,&mdash;would that you
      could awaken to a more worthy estimate&mdash;pardon me&mdash;of the uses
      of exertion! Surely, surely, you must be sensible of the calls that your
      country, that mankind, have at this epoch of the world, upon all&mdash;all,
      especially, possessing your advantages and powers. Can we pierce one inch
      beyond the surface of society, and not see that great events are hastening
      to their birth? Will you let those inferior to yourself hurry on before
      you, and sit inactive while they win the reward? Will you have no share in
      the bright drama that is already prepared behind the dark curtain of fate,
      and which will have a world for its spectators? Ah, how rejoiced, how
      elated with myself I should feel, if I could will over one like you to the
      great cause of honourable exertion!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For one instant Godolphin's eye sparkled, and his pale cheek burned&mdash;but
      the transient emotion faded away as he answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight years ago, when she who spoke to me was Constance Vernon, her wish
      might have moulded me according to her will. Now," and he struggled with
      emotion, and turned away his face,&mdash;"now it is too late!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was smitten to the heart. She laid her hand gently on his arm,
      and said, in a sweet and soothing tone, "No, Percy, not too late!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant, and before Godolphin could reply, they were joined by
      Saville and Lady Charlotte Deerham.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) I suppose Godolphin by the word pleasure rather signifies happiness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LUCILLA'S LETTER.&mdash;THE EFFECT IT PRODUCES ON GODOLPHIN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The short conversation recorded in the last chapter could not but show to
      Godolphin the dangerous ground on which his fidelity to Lucilla rested.
      Never before,&mdash;no, not in the young time of their first passion, had
      Constance seemed to him so lovely or so worthy of love. Her manners now
      were so much more soft and unreserved than they had necessarily been at a
      period when Constance had resolved not to listen to his addresses or her
      own heart, that the only part of her character that had ever repulsed his
      pride or offended his tastes seemed vanished for ever. A more subdued and
      gentle spirit had descended on her surpassing beauty, and the change was
      of an order that Percy Godolphin could especially appreciate. And the
      world, for which he owned reluctantly that she yet lived too much, had,
      nevertheless, seemed rather to enlarge and animate the natural nobleness
      of her mind, than to fritter it down to the standard of its common
      votaries. When she spoke he delighted in, even while he dissented from,
      the high and bold views which she conceived. He loved her indignation of
      all that was mean and low-her passion for all that was daring and exalted.
      Never was he cast down from the height of the imaginative part of his love
      by hearing from her lips one petty passion or one sordid desire; much
      about her was erroneous, but all was lofty and generous&mdash;even in
      error. And the years that had divided them had only taught him to feel
      more deeply how rare was the order of her character, and how impossible it
      was ever to behold her like. All the sentiments, faculties, emotions,
      which in his affection for Lucilla had remained dormant, were excited into
      full play the moment he was in the presence of Constance. She engrossed no
      petty portion&mdash;she demanded and obtained the whole empire&mdash;of
      his soul. And against this empire he had now to contend! Torn as he was by
      a thousand conflicting emotions, a letter from Lucilla was suddenly put
      into his hands; its contents were as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LUCILLA'S LETTER.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thy last letter, my love, was so short and hurried, that it has not cost
      me my usual pains to learn it by heart; nor (shall I tell the truth?) have
      I been so eager as I once was to commit all thy words to my memory. Why, I
      know not, and will guess not,&mdash;but there is something ill thy letters
      since we parted that chills me;&mdash;they throw back my heart upon
      itself. I tear open the seal with so much eagerness&mdash;thou wouldst
      smile if thou couldst see me, and when I discover how few are the words
      upon which I am to live for many days, I feel sick and disappointed, and
      lay down the letter. Then I chide myself and say, 'At least these few
      words will be kind!'&mdash;and I spell them one by one, not to hurry over
      my only solace. Alas! before I arrive at the end, I am blinded by my
      tears; my love for thee, so bounding and full of life, seems frozen and
      arrested at every line. And then I lie down for very weariness, and wish
      to die. O God, if the time has come which I have always dreaded&mdash;if
      thou shouldst no longer love me!&mdash;And how reasonable this fear is!
      For what am I to thee? How often dost thou complain that I can understand
      thee not&mdash;how often dost thou imply that there is much of thy nature
      which I am incapable&mdash; unworthy&mdash;to learn! If this be so, how
      natural is it to dread that thou wilt find others whom thou wilt fancy
      more congenial to thee, and that absence will only remind thee more of my
      imperfections!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet I think that I have read thee to the letter; I think that my
      love, which is always following thee, always watching thee, always
      conjecturing thy wishes, must have penetrated into every secret of thy
      heart: only I want words to express what I feel, and thou layest the blame
      upon the want of feeling! I know how untutored, how ignorant, I must seem
      to thee; and sometimes&mdash;and lately very often&mdash;I reproach myself
      that I have not more diligently sought to make myself a worthier companion
      to thee. I think if I had the same means as others; I should acquire the
      same facility of expressing my thoughts; and my thoughts thou couldst
      never blame, for I know that they are full of a love to thee which&mdash;no&mdash;not
      the wisest&mdash;the most brilliant&mdash;whom thou mayest see could equal
      even in imagination. But I have sought to mend this deficiency since we
      parted; and I have looked into all the books thou hast loved to read, and
      I fancy that I have imbibed now the same ideas which pleased thee, and in
      which once thou imaginedst I could not sympathise. Yet how mistaken thou
      hast been! I see, by marks thou hast placed on the page, the sentiments
      that more especially charm thee; and I know that I have felt them much,
      oh! how much more deeply and vividly than they are there expressed&mdash;only
      they seem to me to have no language&mdash;methinks that I have learned the
      language now. And I have taught myself songs that thou wilt love to hear
      when thou returnest home to me; and I have practised music, and I think&mdash;nay,
      I am sure, that time will not pass so heavily with thee as when thou wast
      last here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when shall I see thee again?&mdash;forgive me if I press thee to
      return. Thou hast stayed away longer than thou hast been wont; but that I
      would not heed; it is not the number of days, but the sensations with
      which I have counted them, that make me pine for thy beloved voice, and
      long once more to behold thee. Never before did I so feel thy absence,
      never before was I so utterly wretched. A secret voice whispers me that we
      are parted for ever. I cannot withstand the omens of my own heart. When my
      poor father lived, I did not, child as I was, partake of those sentiments
      with which he was wont to say the stars inspired us. I could not see in
      them the boders of fear and the preachers of sad tidings; they seemed to
      me only full of serenity and tenderness, and the promise of enduring love!
      And ever when I looked on them, I thought of thee; and thy image to me
      then, as thou knowest it was from childhood, was bright with unimaginable
      but never melancholy spells. But now, although I love thee so far more
      powerfully, I cannot divest the thoughts of thee from a certain sadness;
      and so the stars, which are like thee, which are full of thee, have a
      sadness also! And this, the bed, where every morning I stretch my arms for
      thee, and find thee not, and have yet to live through the day, and on
      which I now write this letter to thee&mdash;for, I who used to rise with
      the sun, am now too dispirited not to endeavour to cheat the weary day&mdash;I
      have made them place nearer to the window; and I look out upon the still
      skies every night, and have made a friend of every star I see. I question
      it of thyself, and wonder, when thou lookest at it, if thou hast any
      thought of me. I love to look upon the heavens much more than upon the
      earth; for the trees, and the waters and the hills around, thou canst not
      behold; but the same heaven which I survey is above thee also; and this,
      our common companion, seems in some measure to unite us. And I have
      thought over my father's lore, and have tried to learn it; Day, thou
      mayest smile, but it is thy absence that has taught me superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But tell me, dearest, kindest, tell me when&mdash;oh, when wilt then
      return? Return only this once&mdash;if but for a day, and I will never
      persecute thee again. Truant as thou art, thou shalt have full liberty for
      life. But I cannot tell thee how sad and heavy I am grown, and every hour
      knocks at my heart like a knell! Come back to thy poor Lucilla&mdash;if
      only to see what joy is! Come&mdash;I know thou wilt! But should anything
      I do not foresee detain thee, fix at least the day&mdash;nay, if possible,
      the hour&mdash;when we shall meet, and let the letter which conveys such
      happy tidings be long, and kind, and full of thee, as thy letters once
      were. I know I weary thee, but I cannot help it. I am weak, and dejected,
      and cast down, and have only heart enough to pray for thy return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have conquered&mdash;you have conquered, Lucilla!" said Godolphin, as
      he kissed this wild and reproachful letter, and thrust it into his bosom;
      "and I&mdash;I will be wretched rather than you shall be so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart rebuked him even for that last sentence. This pure and devoted
      attachment, was it indeed an unhappiness to obtain, and a sacrifice to
      return! Stung by his thoughts, and impatient of rest, he hurried into the
      air;&mdash;he traversed the city; he passed St. Sebastian's Gate, gained
      the Appia Via, and saw, lone and sombre, as of old&mdash;the house of the
      departed Volktman. He had half unconsciously sought that direction, in
      order to strengthen his purpose, and sustain his conscience in its right
      path. He now hurried onwards, and stopped not till he stood in that lovely
      and haunted spot&mdash;the valley of Egeria&mdash;in which he had met
      Lucilla on the day that he first learned her love. There was a gloom over
      the scene now, for the day was dark and clouded: the birds were silent; a
      heavy oppression seemed to brood upon the air. He entered that grotto
      which is the witness of the most beautiful love-story chronicled even in
      the soft south. He recalled the passionate and burning emotions which, the
      last time he had been within that cell, he had felt for Lucilla, and had
      construed erroneously into real love. As he looked around, how different
      an aspect the spot wore! Then, those walls, that spring, even that
      mutilated statue, had seemed to him the encouragers of the soft sensations
      he had indulged. Now, they appeared to reprove the very weakness which
      hallowed themselves&mdash;the associations spoke to him in another tone.
      The broken statue of the river god&mdash;the desert silence in which the
      water of the sweet fountain keeps its melancholy course&mdash;the profound
      and chilling Solitude of the spot&mdash;all seemed eloquent, not of love,
      but the broken hope and the dreary loneliness that succeed it! The gentle
      plant (the capillaire) that overhangs the sides of the grotto, and
      nourishes itself on the dews of the fountain, seemed an emblem of love
      itself after disappointment&mdash;the love that might henceforth be
      Lucilla's&mdash;drooping in silence on the spot once consecrated to
      rapture, and feeding itself with tears. There was something mocking to
      human passion in the very antiquity of the spot; four-and-twenty centuries
      had passed away since the origin of the tale that made it holy&mdash;and
      that tale, too, was fable! What, in this vast accumulation of the sands of
      time, was a solitary atom! What, among the millions, the myriads, that
      around that desolate spot had loved, and forgotten love, was the brief
      passion of one mortal, withering as it sprung! Thus differently moralises
      the heart, according to the passion which bestows on it the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he regained his home, Godolphin's resolve was taken. The next day
      he had promised Constance to attend her to Tivoli; he resolved then to
      take leave of her, and on the following day to return to Lucilla. He
      remembered, with bitter reproach, that he had not written to her for a
      length of time, treble the accustomed interval between his letters; and
      felt that, while at the moment she had written the lines he had now
      pressed to his bosom, she was expecting, with unutterable fondness and
      anxiety, to receive his lukewarm assurances of continued love, the letter
      he was about to write in answer to hers was the first one that would greet
      her eyes. But he resolved, that in that letter, at least, she should not
      be disappointed. He wrote at length, and with all the outpourings of a
      tenderness reawakened by remorse. He informed her of his immediate return,
      and even forced himself to dwell upon it with kindly hypocrisy of
      transport. For the first time for several weeks, he felt satisfied with
      himself as he sealed his letter. It is doubtful whether that letter
      Lucilla ever received.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TIVOLI.&mdash;THE SIREN'S CAVE.&mdash;THE CONFESSION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Along the deathly Campagna, a weary and desolate length of way,&mdash;through
      a mean and squalid row of houses&mdash;you thread your course; and behold&mdash;Tivoli
      bursts upon you!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look&mdash;look!" cried Constance, with enthusiasm, as she pointed to the
      rushing torrent that, through matted trees and cragged precipices,
      thundered on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonished at the silence of Godolphin, whom scenery was usually so wont
      to kindle and inspire, she turned hastily round, and her whole tide of
      feeling was revulsed by the absorbed but intense dejection written on his
      countenance. "Why," said she, after a short pause, and affecting a playful
      smile, "why, how provoking is this! In general, not a common patch of
      green with an old tree in the centre, not a common rivulet with a willow
      hanging over it, escapes you. You insist upon our sharing your raptures&mdash;you
      dilate on the picturesque&mdash;you rise into eloquence; nay, you persuade
      us into your enthusiasm, or you quarrel with us for our coldness; and now,
      with this divinest of earthly scenes around us,&mdash;when even Lady
      Charlotte is excited, and Mr. Saville forgets himself, you are stricken
      into silence and apathy! The reason&mdash;if it be not too abstruse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is here!" said Godolphin, mournfully, and pressing his hand to his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance turned aside; she indulged herself with the hope that he alluded
      to former scenes, and despaired of the future from their remembrance. She
      connected his melancholy with herself, and knew that, when referred to
      her, she could dispel it. Inspired by this idea, and exhilarated by the
      beauty of the morning, and the wonderful magnificence of nature, she
      indulged her spirits to overflowing. And as her brilliant mind lighted up
      every subject it touched, now glowing over description, now flashing into
      remark, Godolphin at one time forgot, and at another more keenly felt, the
      magnitude of the sacrifice he was about to make. But every one knows that
      feeling which, when we are unhappy, illumines (if I may so speak) our
      outward seeming from the fierceness of our inward despair,&mdash;that
      recklessness which is the intoxication of our grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees Godolphin broke from his reserve. He seemed to catch the
      enthusiasm of Constance; he echoed back&mdash;he led into new and more
      dazzling directions&mdash;the delighted remarks of his beautiful
      companion. His mind, if not profoundly learned, at least irregularly rich,
      in the treasures of old times, called up a spirit from every object. The
      waterfall, the ruin, the hollow cave&mdash;the steep bank crested with the
      olive&mdash;the airy temple, the dark pomp of the cypress grove, and the
      roar of the headlong Anio,&mdash;all he touched with the magic of the past&mdash;clad
      with the glories of history and of legend&mdash;and decked ever and anon
      with the flowers of the eternal Poesy that yet walks, mourning for her
      children, amongst the vines and waterfalls of the ancient Tibur. And
      Constance, as she listened to him, entranced, until she herself
      unconsciously grew silent, indulged without reserve in that, the proudest
      luxury of love&mdash;pride in the beloved object. Never had the rare and
      various genius of Godolphin appeared so worthy of admiration. When his
      voice ceased, it seemed to Constance like a sudden blank in the creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin and the young countess were several paces before the little
      party, and they now took their way towards the Siren's Cave. The path that
      leads to that singular spot is humid with an eternal spray; and it is so
      abrupt and slippery, that in order to preserve your footing, you must
      cling to the bushes that vegetate around the sides of the precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us dispense with our guide," said Godolphin. "I know every part of
      the way, and I am sure you share with me in dislike to these hackneyed
      indicators and sign-posts for admiration. Let us leave him to Lady
      Charlotte and Saville, and suffer me to be your guide to the cavern."
      Constance readily enough assented, and they proceeded. Saville, by no
      means liking the difficult and perilous path which was to lead only to a
      very cold place, soon halted; and suggested to Lady Charlotte the
      propriety of doing the same. Lady Charlotte much preferred the wit of her
      companion's conversation to the picturesque. "Besides," as she said, "she
      had seen the cave before." Accordingly, they both waited for the return of
      the more adventurous countess and her guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconscious of the defalcation of her friends, and not&mdash;from the
      attention that every step required&mdash;once looking behind, Constance
      continued. And now, how delightful to her seemed that rugged way, as, with
      every moment, Godolphin's care&mdash;Godolphin's hand became necessary;
      and he, inspired, inflamed by her company, by her touch, by the softness
      of her manner, and the devotion of her attention&mdash;no, no! not yet was
      Lucilla forgotten!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now they stood within the Siren's Cave. From this spot alone you can
      view that terrible descent of waters which rushes to earth like the coming
      of a god! The rocks dripped around them&mdash;the torrent dashed at their
      very feet. Down&mdash;down, in thunder, for ever and for ever, dashed the
      might of the maddening element; above, all wrath; below, all blackness;&mdash;there,
      the cataract; here, the abyss. Not a moment's pause to the fury, not a
      moment's silence to the roar;&mdash;forward to the last glimpse of the sun&mdash;the
      curse of labour, and the soul of unutterable strength, shall be upon those
      waters! The demon, tormented to an eternity, filling his dread
      dwelling-place with the unresting and unearthly voice of his rage and
      despair, is the only type meet for the spirit of the cataract.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there&mdash;amidst this awful and tremendous eternity of strife and
      power&mdash;stood two beings whose momentary existence was filled with the
      master-passion of humanity. And that passion was yet audible there: the
      nature without coal; I not subdue that within. Even amidst the icy showers
      of spray that fell around, and would have frozen the veins of others,
      Godolphin felt the burning at his heart. Constance was indeed utterly lost
      in a whirl and chaos of awe and admiration, which deprived her of all
      words. But it was the nature of her wayward lover to be aroused only to
      the thorough knowledge of his powers and passions among the more
      unfrequent and fierce excitements of life. A wild emotion now urged him
      on; something of that turbulent exaggeration of mind which gave rise to a
      memorable and disputed saying&mdash;"If thou stoodest on a precipice with
      thy mistress, hast thou ever felt the desire to plunge with her into the
      abyss?&mdash;If so&mdash;thou hast loved!" No doubt the sentiment is
      exaggerated, but there are times when love is exaggerated too. And now
      Constance, without knowing it, had clung closer and closer to Godolphin.
      His hand at first&mdash;now his arm&mdash;supported her; and at length, by
      an irresistible and maddening impulse, he clasped her to his breast, and
      whispered in a voice which was heard by her even amidst the thunder of the
      giant waters, "Here, here, my early&mdash;my only love, I feel, in spite
      of myself, that I never utterly, fully, adored you until now!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LUCILLA.&mdash;THE SOLITUDE.&mdash;THE SPELL.&mdash;THE DREAM AND THE
      RESOLVE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      While the above events, so fatal to Lucilla, were in progress at Rome, she
      was holding an unquiet commune with her own passionate and restless heart,
      by the borders of the lake, whose silver quiet mocked the mind it had, in
      happier moments, reflected. She had now dragged on the weary load of time
      throughout the winter; and the early and soft spring was already abroad&mdash;smoothing
      the face of the waters, and calling life into the boughs. Hitherto this
      time of the year had possessed a mysterious and earnest attraction for
      Lucilla&mdash;now all its voices were mute. The letters that Godolphin had
      written to her were so few, and so restrained, in comparison with those
      which she had received in the former periods of absence, that&mdash;ever
      alive as she was to impulse, and unregulated by settled principles of hope&mdash;her
      only relief to a tearful and spiritless dejection was in paroxysms of
      doubt, jealousy, and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the most common thing in the world, that, when we have once wronged
      a person, we go on in the wrong, from a certain soreness with which
      conscience links the associations of the injured party. And thus,
      Godolphin, struggling with the return to his early and never-forgotten
      love, felt an unwillingness that he could seldom successfully combat, in
      playing the hypocrite to Lucilla. His very remorse made him unkind; the
      feeling that he ought to write often, made him write seldom: and conscious
      that he ought to return her expressions of eager devotion, he returned
      them with involuntary awkwardness and reserve. All this is very natural,
      and very evident to us; but a thousand mysteries were more acceptable to,
      more sought for and more clung to, by Lucilla, than a conjecture at the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile she fed more and more eagerly on those vain researches which yet
      beguiled her time, and flattered her imagination. In a science so false,
      and so unprofitable, it mattered, happily, little, whether or not the poor
      disciple laboured with success; but I need scarcely tell to any who have
      had the curiosity to look over the entangled schemes and quaint figures of
      the art, how slender was the advancement of the daughter in the learning
      of the sire. Still it was a comfort and a soothing, even to look upon the
      placid heaven, and form a conjecture as to the language of its stars. And,
      above all, while she questioned the future, she thought only of her lover.
      But day after day passed&mdash;no letter, or worse than none; and at
      length Lucilla became utterly impatient of all rest: a nervous fever
      possessed her; the extreme solitude of the place filled her with that
      ineffable sensation of irritability which sometimes preludes the madness
      that has been produced in criminals by solitary confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day that she wrote that letter to Godolphin which I have
      transcribed, this painful tension of the nerves was more than hitherto
      acute. She longed to fly somewhere; nay, once or twice, she remembered
      that Rome was easily gained, that she might be there as expeditiously as
      her letter. Although in that letter only we have signified that Lucilla
      had expressed her wish for Godolphin's return; yet, in all her later
      letters, she had (perhaps, more timidly) urged that desire. But they had
      not taken the same hold on Godolphin; nor, while he was playing with his
      danger, had they produced the same energetic resolution. Lucilla could
      not, however, hope with much reason that the success of her present letter
      would be greater than that of her former ones; and, at all events, she did
      not anticipate an immediate compliance with her prayers. She looked
      forward to some excuses, and to some delay. We cannot, therefore, wonder
      that she felt a growing desire to follow her own epistle to Rome; and
      although she had been prevented before, and still drew back from
      absolutely favoring and enforcing the idea, by the fear of Godolphin's
      displeasure; yet she trusted enough to his gentleness of character to feel
      sure that the displeasure could scarcely be lasting. Still the step was
      bold, and Lucilla loved devotedly enough to be timid; and besides, her
      inexperience made her look upon the journey as a far more formidable
      expedition than it really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debating the notion in her mind, she sought her usual retreat, and turned
      listlessly over the books which she had so lately loved to study. At
      length, in moving one she had not looked into before, a paper fell to the
      ground; she picked it up; it was the paper containing that figure, which
      it will be remembered, the astrologer had shown to his daughter, as a
      charm to produce dreams prophetic of any circumstance or person concerning
      whom the believer might be anxious to learn aught. As she saw the image,
      which, the reader will recollect, was of a remarkable design, the whole of
      her conversation with Volktman on the subject rushed into her mind, and
      she resolved that very night to prove the efficacy of the charm on which
      he had so confidently insisted. Fraught with the chimerical delusion, she
      now longed for the hours to pass, and the night to come. She looked again
      and again at the singular image and the portentous figures wrought upon
      the charm; the very strangeness of the characters inspired her, as was
      natural, with a belief of their efficacy; and she felt a thrill, an awe,
      creep over her blood, as the shadows of eve, deepening over the far
      mountains, brought on the time of trial. At length it was night, and
      Lucilla sought her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour was exceedingly serene, and the stars shone through the casement
      with a lustre that to her seemed ominous. With bare feet, and only in her
      night-robe, she stole tremblingly across the threshold. She paused for a
      moment at the window, and looked out on the deep and quiet night; and as
      she so stood, it was a picture that, had I been a painter, I would have
      devoted a youth to accomplish. Half in light&mdash;half in shadow&mdash;her
      undress gave the outline, and somewhat more, of a throat and breast, whose
      roundness, shape, and hue, never were surpassed. Her arms were lightly
      crossed above her bosom; and her long rich hair seeming darker by that
      light, fell profusely, yet not dishevelled, around her neck; parting from
      her brow. Her attitude at that moment was quite still, as if in worship,
      and perhaps it was; her face was inclined slightly upward, looking to the
      heavens and towards Rome. But that face&mdash;there was the picture! It
      was so young, so infantine, so modest; and yet, the youth and the timidity
      were elevated and refined by the earnest doubt, the preternatural terror,
      the unearthly hope, which dwelt upon her forehead&mdash;her parted lip,
      and her wistful and kindled eye. There was a sublimity in her loneliness
      and her years, and in the fond and vain superstition, which was but a
      spirit called from the deeps of an unfathomable and mighty love. And afar
      was heard the breaking of the lake in upon the shore&mdash;no other sound!
      And now, among the unwaving pines, there was a silver shimmer as the moon
      rose into her empire, and deepened at once, along the universal scene, the
      loveliness and the awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla turned from the window, and kneeling down wrote with a trembling
      hand upon the figure one word&mdash;the name of Godolphin. She then placed
      it under her pillow, and the spell was concluded. The astrologer had told
      her of the necessary co-operation which the mind must afford to the charm;
      but it will easily be believed that Lucilla required no injunction to let
      her imagination dwell upon the vision she expected to invoke. And it would
      have been almost strange, if, so intently and earnestly brooding, as she
      had done over the image of Godolphin, that image had not, without
      recurring to any cabalistical spells, been present to her dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that it was broad noonday, and that she was sitting alone in
      the house she then inhabited, and weeping bitterly. Of a sudden the voice
      of Godolphin called to her; she ran eagerly forth, but no sooner had she
      passed the threshold, than the scene so familiar to her vanished, and she
      was alone in an immense and pathless wilderness; there was no tree and no
      water in this desert; all was arid, solitary, and inanimate. But what
      seemed most strange to her was that in the heavens, although they were
      clear and bright, there was neither sun nor stars; the light seemed
      settled and stagnant&mdash;there was in it no life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she thought that she continued to move involuntarily along the waste;
      and that, ever and anon, she yearned and strove to rest, but her limbs did
      not obey her will, and a power she could not control urged her onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now there was no longer an utter dumbness and death over the scene.
      Forth from the sands, as from the bowels of the reluctant earth, there
      crept, one by one, loathly and reptile shapes; obscene sounds rang in her
      ears&mdash;now in a hideous mockery, now in a yet more sickening
      solicitation. Shapes of terror thickened and crowded round her. She was
      roused by dread into action; she hurried faster and faster; she strove to
      escape; and ever as she fled, the sounds grew louder, and the persecuting
      shapes more ghastly,&mdash;abominations which her pure mind shuddered to
      behold, presented themselves at every turn: there was no spot for refuge,
      no cave for concealment. Wearied and despairing, she stopped short; but
      then the shapes and sounds seemed gradually to lose their terror; her eye
      and ear became familiar to them; and what at first seemed foes, grew into
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, again, the wilderness was gone; she stood in a strange spot, and
      opposite, and gazing upon her with intent and mournful eyes, stood
      Godolphin. But he seemed much older than he was, and the traces of care
      were ploughed deeply on his countenance; and above them both hung a
      motionless and livid cloud; and from the cloud a gigantic hand was
      stretched forth, pointing with a shadowy and unmoving finger towards a
      quarter of the earth which was enveloped in a thick gloom. While she
      sought with straining eyes, to penetrate the darkness of the spot thus
      fearfully marked out, she thought Godolphin vanished, and all was suddenly
      and utter night&mdash;night, but not stillness&mdash;for there was a roar
      as of many winds, and a dashing of angry waters, that seemed close
      beneath; and she heard the trees groan and bend, and felt the icy and
      rushing air: the tempests were abroad. But amidst the mingling of the
      mighty sounds, she heard distinctly the ringing of a horse's hoofs; and
      presently a wild cry, in which she recognised the voice of Godolphin, rang
      forth, adding to the wrath of nature the yet more appalling witness of a
      human despair. The cry was followed by the louder dashing of the waves,
      and the fiercer turmoil of the winds; and then her anguish and horror
      freeing her from the Prison of Sleep, she woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly day, but the serenity of the late night had gone; the rain
      fell in torrents, and the house shook beneath the fury of a violent storm.
      This change in the mood of nature had probably influenced the latter part
      of her dream. But Lucilla thought of no natural solution to the dreadful
      vision she had undergone. Her superstition was confirmed and ratified by
      the intense impression wrought upon her mind by the dream. A thousand
      unutterable fears, fears for Godolphin, rather than herself&mdash;or if
      for herself, only in connection with him&mdash;bore irresistible despotism
      over her thoughts. She could not endure to wait, to linger any longer in
      the dark and agitated suspense she herself had created; the idea she
      before had nursed now became resolve, she determined forthwith to set out
      for Rome&mdash;to see Godolphin. She rose, woke her attendant, and that
      very day she put her resolution into effect.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JOY AND DESPAIR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was approaching towards the evening as Lucilla paused for a few seconds
      at the door which led to Godolphin's apartments. At length she summoned
      courage. The servant who admitted her was Godolphin's favorite domestic;
      and he was amazed, but overjoyed, to see her; for Lucilla was the idol of
      all who knew her,&mdash;save of him, whose love only she cared and lived
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      His master, he said, was gone out for a short time, but the next day they
      were to have returned home. Lucilla coloured with vivid delight to hear
      that her letter had produced an effect she had not hoped so expeditiously
      to accomplish. She passed on into Godolphin's apartment. The room bore
      evident signs of approaching departure; the trunks lay half-packed on the
      floor; there was all that importance of confusion around which makes to
      the amateur traveller a luxury out of discomfort. Lucilla sat down, and
      waited, anxious and trembling, for her lover. Her woman, who had
      accompanied her, thinking of more terrestrial concerns than love, left
      her, at her desire. She could not rest long; she walked, agitating and
      expecting, to and fro the long and half-furnished chamber which
      characterises the Italian palace. At length, her eye fell on an open
      letter on a writing-table at one corner of the room. She glanced over it
      mechanically,&mdash;certain words suddenly arrested her attention. Were
      those words&mdash;words of passion&mdash;addressed to her? If not, O
      Heaven! to whom? She obeyed, as she ever did, the impulse of the moment,
      and read what follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Constance&mdash;As I write that word how many remembrances rush upon me!&mdash;for
      how many years has that name been a talisman to my heart, waking its
      emotions at will! You are the first woman I ever really loved: you
      rejected me, yet I could not disdain you. You became another's but my love
      could not desert you. Your hand wrote the history of my life after the
      period when we met,&mdash;my habits&mdash;my thoughts&mdash;you influenced
      and coloured them all! And now, Constance, you are free; and I love you
      more fervently than ever! And you&mdash;yes, you would not reject me now;
      you have grown wiser, and learned the value of a heart. And yet the same
      Fate that divided us hitherto will divide us now; all obstacles but one
      are passed away&mdash;of that one you shall hear and judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we parted, Constance, years ago, I did not submit tamely to the
      burning remembrance you bequeathed me; I sought to dissipate your image,
      and by wooing others to forget yourself. Need I say, that to know another
      was only to remember you the more? But among the other and far less worthy
      objects of my pursuit was one whom, had I not seen you first, I might have
      loved as ardently as I do you; and in the first flush of emotion, and the
      heat of sudden events, I imagined that I did so love her. She was an
      orphan, a child in years and in the world; and I was all to her&mdash;I
      am, all to her. She is not mine by the ties of the Church; but I have
      pledged a faith to her equally sacred and as strong. Shall I break that
      faith? shall I betray that trust? shall I crush a heart that has always
      been mine&mdash;mine more tenderly than yours, rich in a thousand gifts
      and resources, ever was or ever can be? Shall I,&mdash;sworn to protect
      her&mdash;I, who have already robbed her of fame and friends, rob her now
      of father, brother, lover, husband, the world itself,&mdash;for I am all
      to her? Never&mdash;never! I shall be wretched throughout life: I shall
      know that you are free that you&mdash;oh! Constance! you might be mine!&mdash;but
      she shall never dream what she has cost me! I have been too cold, too
      ungrateful to her already&mdash;I will make her amends. My heart may break
      in the effort, but it shall reward her. You, Constance, in the pride of
      your lofty station, your strengthened mind, your regulated virtue (fenced
      in by the hundred barriers of custom), you cannot, perhaps, conceive how
      pure and devoted the soul of this poor girl is! She is not one whom I
      could heap riches upon and leave:&mdash;my love is all the riches she
      knows. Earth has not a consolation or a recompense for the loss of my
      affection: and even Heaven itself she has never learned to think of,
      except as a place in which we shall be united for ever. As I write this I
      know that she is sitting afar off and alone, and thinking only of one
      whose whole soul, fated and accursed as he is, is maddened by the love of
      another. My letters, her only comfort, have been cold and few of late; I
      know how they have wrung her heart. I picture to myself her solitude&mdash;her
      sadness&mdash;her unfriended youth&mdash;her ardent mind, which, not
      enriched by culture, clings, feeds, lives only on one idea. Before you
      receive this, I shall be on the road to her. Never again will I risk the
      temptation I have under gone. I am not a vain man; I do not deceive
      myself; I do not imagine, I do not insult you by believing, that you will
      long or bitterly feel my loss. I have loved you far better than you have
      loved me, and you have uncounted channels for your bright hopes and your
      various ambition. You love the world, and the world is at your feet! And
      in remembering me now, you may think you have cause for indignation. Why,
      with the knowledge of a tie that forbade me to hope for you, why did I
      linger round you? why did I give vent to any word, or license to any look,
      that told you I loved you still? Why, above all, on that fated yesterday,
      when we stood alone surrounded by the waters,&mdash;why did I dare forget
      myself&mdash;why clasp you to my breast&mdash;why utter the assurance of
      that love which was a mockery, if I were not about solemnly to record it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "This you will ask; and if you are not satisfied with the answer, your
      pride will clothe my memory with resentment. Be it so&mdash;yet hear me.
      Constance, when, in my first youth, at the time when the wax was yet soft,
      and the tree might yet be bent&mdash;when I laid my heart and my future
      lot at your feet&mdash;when you, at the dictates of a worldly and cold
      ambition (disguise the name as you will, the reality is the same), threw
      me back on the solitary desert of life; when you rejected&mdash;forsook
      me;&mdash;do you think that, although I loved you still, there was no
      anger mingled with the love! We met again: but what years of wasted
      existence&mdash;of dimmed hope&mdash;of deadened emotion&mdash;had passed
      over me since then! And who had thus marked them? You! Do you wonder,
      then, that something of human pride asked for human vengeance? Yes! I
      pined for some triumph in my turn: I longed to try whether I was yet
      forgotten&mdash;whether the heart which stung me had been stung also in
      the wound that it inflicted. Was not this natural? Ask yourself, and blame
      me if you can. But by degrees, as I gazed upon a beauty, and listened to a
      voice, softer in their character than of old,&mdash;as I felt that you
      would not deny me retribution, this selfish desire for revenge died away,
      and, by degrees, all emotions were merged in one&mdash;unconquered,
      unconquerable love. And can you blame me, if then&mdash;traitor to myself
      as to you&mdash;I lingered on the spot?&mdash;if I had many struggles to
      endure before I could resolve on the sacrifice I now make? Alas! it has
      cost me much to be just. Can you blame me if at all times I could not
      control my words and looks? Nay, even in our last meeting, when I was
      maddened by the thought that we were about to part for ever&mdash;when we
      stood alone&mdash;when no eye was near&mdash;when you clung to me in a
      delicious timidity&mdash;when your breath was on my cheek&mdash;when the
      heaving of your heart was heard by mine&mdash;when my hand touched that
      which could give me all the world in itself&mdash;when my arm encircled
      that glorious and divine shape&mdash;0 Heaven! can you blame me&mdash;can
      you wonder if I was transported beyond myself;&mdash;if conscience,
      reason, all were forgotten, and I thought&mdash;felt&mdash;lived&mdash;but
      for the moment and for you? No, you will feel for the weakness of nature;
      you will not judge me harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should you rob me of the remembrance of that brief moment&mdash;that
      wild embrace? How often shall I recall it!&mdash;How often when the light
      step of her to whom I return glides around me, shall I cheat myself, and
      think it yours; when I feel her breath at night, shall I not start&mdash;and
      dream it comes from your lips? and in returning her unconscious caress,
      let me fancy it is you whispers me the assurances of unutterable love!
      Forgive me, Constance, my yet adored Constance, whom I shall never see
      more, for these wild words&mdash;this momentary weakness. Farewell!
      Whatever becomes of me, may God give you all His blessings!
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word more&mdash;no, I will not close this letter yet! You remember
      that you once gave me a flower&mdash;years ago. I have preserved its
      leaves to this day; but I will give no indulgence to a folly that will now
      wrong you, and be unworthy of myself. I will send you back those leaves:
      let them plead for me, as the memories of former days. I must break off
      now, for I can literally write no more. I must go forth and recover my
      self-command. And oh! may she whom I seek to-morrow&mdash;whose
      unsuspecting heart admonished by temptation, I will watch over, guide, and
      shield far, far more zealously than I have yet done&mdash;never know what
      it has cost me, not to abandon and betray her."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lucilla read over every word of this letter! How wholly impossible it
      is for language to express the agony, the hopeless, irremediable despair
      that deepened within her as she proceeded to the end! Everything that life
      had, or could ever have had for her, of common peace or joy, was blasted
      for ever! As she came to the last word, she bowed her head in silence over
      the writing, and felt as if some mighty rock had fallen upon her heart,
      and crushed it to dust. Had the letter breathed but one unkind&mdash;one
      slighting expression of her, it would have been some comfort&mdash;some
      rallying point, however forlorn and wretched; but this cruel tenderness&mdash;this
      bitter generosity!
    </p>
    <p>
      And before she had read that letter, how joyously, how breathlessly she
      had anticipated rushing to her lover's breast! It seems incredible that
      the space of a few minutes should suffice to blight a whole existence&mdash;blacken
      without a ray of hope an entire future!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aroused by the sound of steps, though in another apartment; she
      would not now have met Godolphin for worlds; the thought of his return
      alone gave her the power of motion. She thrust the fatal letter into her
      bosom; and then, in characters surprisingly distinct and clear, she wrote
      her name, and placed that writing in the stead of the epistle she took
      away. She judged rightly, that that single name would suffice to say all
      she could not then say. Having done this, she rose, left the room, and
      stole softly and unperceived into the open street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconscious and careless whither she went, she hurried on, her eyes bent
      on the ground, and concealing her form and face with her long mantle. The
      streets at Rome are not thronged as with us; nor does there exist, in a
      city consecrated by so many sublime objects, that restless and vulgar
      curiosity which torments the English public. Each lives in himself, not in
      his neighbour. The moral air of Rome is Indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucilla, therefore, hurried along unmolested and unobserved, until at
      length her feet failed her, and she sank exhausted, but still unconscious
      of her movements and of all around, upon one of the scattered fragments of
      ancient pride that at every turn are visible in the streets of Rome. The
      place was quiet and solitary, and darkened by the shadows of a palace that
      reared itself close beside. She sat down; and shrouding her face as it
      drooped over her breast, endeavoured to collect her thoughts. Presently
      the sound of a guitar was heard; and along the street came a little group
      of the itinerant musicians who invest modern Italy with its yet living air
      of poetry: the reality is gone, but the spirit lingers. They stopped
      opposite a small house; and Lucilla, looking up, saw the figure of a young
      girl placing a light at the window as a signal well known, and then she
      glided away. Meanwhile, the lover (who had accompanied the musicians, and
      seemed in no very elevated rank of life) stood bare-headed beneath; and in
      his upward look there was a devotion, a fondness, a respect, that brought
      back to Lucilla all the unsparing bitterness of contrast and recollection.
      And now the serenade began. The air was inexpressibly soft and touching,
      and the words were steeped in that vague melancholy which is inseparable
      from the tenderness, if not from the passion, of love. Lucilla listened
      involuntarily, and the charm slowly wrought its effect. The hardness and
      confusion of her mind melted gradually away, and as the song ended she
      turned aside and burst into tears. "Happy, happy girl!" she murmured; "she
      is loved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here let us drop the curtain upon Lucilla. Often, O Reader! shalt thou
      recall this picture; often shalt thou see her before thee&mdash;alone and
      broken-hearted&mdash;weeping in the twilight streets of Rome!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LOVE STRONG AS DEATH, AND NOT LESS BITTER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Godolphin returned home the door was open, as Lucilla had left it,
      and he went at once into his apartment. He hastened to the table on which
      he had left, with the negligence arising from the emotions of the moment,
      the letter to Constance,&mdash;the paper on which Lucilla bad written her
      name alone met his eye. While yet stunned and amazed, his servant and
      Lucilla's entered: in a few moments he had learned all they had to tell
      him; the rest Lucilla's handwriting did indeed sufficiently explain. He
      comprehended all; and, in a paroxysm of alarm and remorse, he dispersed
      his servants, and hurried himself in search of her. He went to the house
      of her relations; they had not seen or heard of her. It was now night, and
      every obstacle in the way of his search presented itself. Not a clue could
      be traced; or, sometimes following a description that seemed to him
      characteristic, he chased, and found some wanderer&mdash;how unlike
      Lucilla! Towards daybreak he returned home, after a vain and weary search;
      and his only comfort was in learning from her attendant that she had about
      her a sum of money which he knew would in Italy always purchase safety and
      attention. Yet, alone, at night, in the streets,&mdash;so utter a stranger
      as she was to the world,&mdash;so young and so lovely&mdash;he shuddered,
      he gasped for breath at the idea. Might she destroy herself? That hideous
      question forced itself upon him; he could not exclude it: he trembled when
      he recalled her impassioned and keen temper; and when, in remembering the
      tone and words of his letter to Constance, he felt how desperate a pang
      every sentence must have inflicted upon her. And, indeed, even his
      imagination could not equal the truth, when it attempted to sound the
      depths of her wounded feelings. He only returned home to sally out again.
      He now employed the police, and those most active and vigilant agents that
      at Rome are willing to undertake all enterprises;&mdash;he could not but
      feel assured of discovering her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, noon&mdash;evening came on, and no tidings. As he once
      more returned home, in the faint hope that some intelligence might await
      him there, his servant hurried eagerly out to him with a letter&mdash;it
      was from Lucilla, and it was worthy of her: give it to the reader.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        LUCILLA'S LETTER.
</pre>
    <p>
      "I have read your letter to another! Are not these words sufficient to
      tell you all? All? no! you never, never, never can tell how crushed and
      broken my heart is. Why?&mdash;because you are a man, and because you have
      never loved as I loved. Yes, Godolphin, I knew that I was not one whom you
      could love. I am a poor, ignorant, untutored girl, with nothing at my
      heart but a great world of love which I could never tell. Thou saidst I
      could not comprehend thee: alas! how much was there&mdash;is there&mdash;in
      my nature&mdash;in my feelings, which have been, and ever will be,
      unfathomable to thy sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      "But all this matters not; the tie between us is eternally broken. Go,
      dear, dear Godolphin! link thyself to that happier other one&mdash;seemingly
      so much more thine equal than the lowly and uncultivated Lucilla. Grieve
      not for me; you have been kind, most kind, to me. You have taken away
      hope, but you have given me pride in its stead;&mdash;the blow which has
      crushed my heart has given strength to my mind. Were you and I left alone
      on the earth, we must still be apart; I could never, never live with you
      again; my world is not your world; when our hearts have ceased to be in
      common, what of union is there left to us? Yet it would be something if,
      since the future is shut out from me, you had not also deprived me of the
      past: I have not even the privilege of looking back! What! all the while
      my heart was lavishing itself upon thee&mdash;all the while I had no other
      thought, no other dream but thee&mdash;all the while I sat by thy side,
      and watched thee, hanging on thy wish, striving to foresee thy thoughts&mdash;all
      the while I was the partner of thy days, and at night my bosom was thy
      pillow, and I could not sleep from the bliss of thinking thee so near me:
      thy heart was then indeed away from me: thy thoughts estranged; I was to
      thee only an encumbrance&mdash;a burthen, from which thy sigh was to be
      free! Can I ever look back, then, to those hours we spent together? All
      that vast history of the past is but one record of bitterness and shame.
      And yet I cannot blame thee; it were something if I could: in proportion
      as you loved me not, you were kind and generous; and God will bless you
      for that kindness to the poor orphan. A harsh word, a threatening glance,
      I never had the affliction to feel from thee. Tracing the blighted past, I
      am only left to sadden at that gentleness which never came from love!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, Godolphin&mdash;I repeat the prayer in all humbleness and sincerity&mdash;go
      to her whom thou lovest, perhaps as I loved thee; go, and in your
      happiness I shall feel at last something of happiness myself. We part for
      ever, but there is no unkindness between us; there is no reproach that one
      can make against the other. If I have sinned, it has been against Heaven
      and not thee; and thou&mdash;why, even against Heaven mine was all the
      fault&mdash;the rashness the madness! You will return to your native land;
      to that proud England, of which I have so often questioned you, and which,
      even in your answers, seems to me so cold and desolate a spot,&mdash;a
      land so hostile to love. There, in your new ties, you will learn new
      objects, and you will be too busy, and too happy, for your thoughts to
      turn to me again. Too happy?&mdash;No, I wish I could think you would be;
      but I whom you deny to possess sympathies with you&mdash;I have at least
      penetrated so far into your heart as to fear that, come what may, you will
      never find the happiness you ask. You exact too much, you dream too
      fondly, not to be discontented with the truth. What has happened to me
      must happen to my rival&mdash;will happen to you throughout life. Your
      being is in one world, your soul is in another. Alas! how foolishly I run
      on, as if seeking in your nature and not circumstances, the blow that
      separates us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall hasten to a conclusion. I have gained a refuge in this convent;
      seek me not, follow me not, I implore, I adjure thee; it can serve no
      purpose. I would not see thee; the veil is already drawn between thy world
      and me, and it only remains, in kindness and in charity, to bid each other
      farewell. Farewell, then! I think I am now with thee; I think my lips have
      breathed aside thy long hair, and cling to thy fair temples with a
      sister's&mdash;-that word, at least, is left me&mdash;a sister's kiss. As
      we stood together, at the grey dawn, when we last parted&mdash;as then, in
      sorrow and in tears, I hid my face in thy bosom&mdash;as then, unconscious
      of what was to come, I poured forth my assurances of faithful unswerving
      thought&mdash;as thrice thou didst tear thyself from me and didst thrice
      return&mdash;and as, through the comfortless mists of morn I gazed after
      thee, and fancied for hours that thy last words yet rang in my ear; so
      now, but with different feelings, I once more bid thee farewell&mdash;farewell
      for ever!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GODOLPHIN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "No, signor, she will not see you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have given my note&mdash;given that ring?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have, and she still refuses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Refuses?&mdash;and is that all the answer? no line to&mdash;to soften the
      reply?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signor, I have spoken all my message."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cruel, hard-hearted! May I call again, think you, with a better success?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The convent, at stated times, is open to strangers, signor; but so far as
      the young signora is concerned I feel assured, from her manner, that your
      visits will be in vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay&mdash;ay, I understand you, madam; you wish to entice her from the
      wicked world,&mdash;to suffer not human friendships to disturb her
      thoughts. Good Heavens! and can she, so young, so ardent, dream of taking
      the veil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does not dream of it," said the nun, coolly; "she has no intention of
      remaining here long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Befriend me, I beseech you!" cried Godolphin, eagerly "restore her to me;
      let me only come once to her within these walls and I will enrich your&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signor, good-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dejected, melancholy, and yet enraged amidst all his sorrow, Godolphin
      returned to Rome. Lucilla's letter rankled in his heart like the barb of a
      broken arrow; but the stern resolve with which she had refused to see him
      appeared to the pride that belongs to manhood a harsh and unfeeling
      insult. He knew not that poor Lucilla's eyes had watched him from the
      walls of the convent, and that while, for his sake more than her own, she
      had refused the meeting he prayed for, she had not the resolution to deny
      herself the luxury of gazing on him once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached Rome; he found a note on his table from Lady Charlotte Deerham,
      saying she had heard it was his intention to leave Rome, and begging him
      to receive from her that evening her adieux. "Lady Erpingham will be with
      me," concluded the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought a new train of ideas. Since Lucilla's flight, all thought but
      of Lucilla had been expelled from Godolphin's mind. We have seen how his
      letter to Lady Erpingham miscarried: he had written no other. How strange
      to Constance must seem his conduct, after the scene of the avowal in the
      Siren's Cave: no excuse on the one hand, no explanation on the other; and
      now what explanation should he give? There was no longer a necessity, for
      it was no longer honesty and justice to fly from the bliss that might
      await him&mdash;the love of his early&mdash;worshipped Constance. But
      could he, with a heart yet bleeding from the violent rupture of one tie,
      form a new one? Agitated, restless, self-reproachful, bewildered, and
      uncertain, he could not bear thoughts that demanded answers to a thousand
      questions; he flung from his cheerless room, and hastened, with a feverish
      pulse and burning temples, to Lady Charlotte Deerham's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens! how ill you look, Mr. Godolphin!" cried the hostess,
      involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ill!&mdash;ha! ha! I never was better; but I have just returned from a
      long journey: I have not touched food nor felt sleep for three days and
      nights! 1-ha, ha! no, I'm not ill;" and, with an eye bright with gathering
      delirium, Godolphin glared around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Charlotte drew back and shuddered; Godolphin felt a cool, soft hand
      laid on his; he turned and the face of Constance, full of anxious and
      wondering pity, was bent upon him. He stood arrested for one moment, and
      then, seizing that hand, pressed it to his lips&mdash;his heart, and burst
      suddenly into tears. That paroxysm saved his life; for days afterwards he
      was insensible.

      CHAPTER XLV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE DECLARATION.&mdash;THE APPROACHING NUPTIALS.&mdash;IS THE IDEALIST
      CONTENTED?
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Godolphin returned to health, and, day after day, the presence of
      Constance, her soft tones, her deep eyes, grew on him, renewing their
      ancient spells, the reader must perceive that bourne to which events
      necessarily tended. For some weeks not a word that alluded to the Siren's
      Cave was uttered by either; but when that allusion came at last from
      Godolphin's lips, the next moment he was kneeling beside Constance, her
      hand surrendered to his, and her proud cheek all bathed in the blushes of
      sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so," said Saville, "you, Percy Godolphin, are at last the accepted
      lover of Constance, Countess of Erpingham. When is the wedding to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not," replied Godolphin, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I almost envy you; you will be very happy for six weeks, and that's
      something in this disagreeable world. Yet now, I look on you, I grow
      reconciled to myself again; you do not seem so happy as that I, Augustus
      Saville, should envy you while my digestion lasts. What are you thinking
      of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," replied Godolphin, vacantly; the words of Lucilla were weighing
      at his heart, like a prophecy working towards its fulfilment: "Come what
      may, you will never find the happiness you ask: you exact too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Lady Erpingham's page entered with a note from Constance,
      and a present of flowers. No one ever wrote half so beautifully, so
      spiritually as Constance, and to Percy the wit was so intermingled with
      the tenderness!
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said he, burying his lips among the flowers; "no! I discard the
      foreboding; with you I must be happy!" But conscience, still unsilenced,
      whispered Lucilla!
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage was to take place at Rome. The day was fixed; and, owing to
      Constance's rank, beauty and celebrity, the news of the event created
      throughout "the English in Italy" no small sensation. There was a great
      deal of gossip, of course, on the occasion; and some of this gossip found
      its way to the haughty ears of Constance. It was said that she had made a
      strange match&mdash;that it was a curious weakness in one so proud and
      brilliant, to look no loftier than a private and not very wealthy
      gentleman; handsome, indeed, and reputed clever; but one who had never
      distinguished himself in anything&mdash;who never would!
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was alarmed and stung, not at the vulgar accusation, the paltry
      sneer, but at the prophecy relating to Godolphin: "he had never
      distinguished himself in anything&mdash;he never would." Rank, wealth,
      power, Constance felt these she wanted not, these she could command of
      herself; but she felt also that a nobler vanity of her nature required
      that the man of her mature and second choice should not be one, in repute,
      of that mere herd, above whom, in reality, his genius so eminently exalted
      him. She deemed it essential to her future happiness that Godolphin's
      ambition should be aroused, that he should share her ardour for those
      great objects that she felt would for ever be dear to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love Rome!" said she, passionately, one day, as accompanied by
      Godolphin, she left the Vatican; "I feel my soul grow larger amidst its
      ruins. Elsewhere, through Italy, we live in the present, but here in the
      past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say not that that is the better life, dear Constance; the present&mdash;can
      we surpass it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance blushed, and thanked her lover with a look that told him he was
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet," said she, returning to the subject, "who can breathe the air that
      is rife with glory, and not be intoxicated with emulation? Ah, Percy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Constance! and what wouldst thou have of me? Is it not glory enough
      to be thy lover?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let the world be as proud of my choice as I am." Godolphin frowned; he
      penetrated in those words to Constance's secret meaning. Accustomed to be
      an idol from his boyhood, he resented the notion that he had need of
      exertion to render him worthy even of Constance; and sensible that it
      might be thought he made an alliance beyond his just pretensions, he was
      doubly tenacious as to his own claims. Godolphin frowned, then, and turned
      away in silence. Constance sighed; she felt that she might not renew the
      subject. But, after a pause, Godolphin himself continued it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Constance," said he, in a low firm voice, "let us understand each other.
      You are all to me in the world; fame, and honor, and station and
      happiness. Am I, also, that all to you? If there be any thought at your
      heart which whispers you, 'You might have served your ambition better; you
      have done wrong in yielding to love and love only,'&mdash;then, Constance,
      pause; it is not too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I deserve this, Percy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You drop words sometimes," answered Godolphin, "that seem to indicate
      that you think the world may cavil at your choice, and that some exertion
      on my part is necessary to maintain your dignity. Constance, need I say,
      again and again, that I adore the very dust you tread on? But I have a
      pride, a self-respect, beneath which I cannot stoop; if you really think
      or feel this, I will not condescend to receive even happiness from you:
      let us part."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance saw his lips white and quivering as he spoke; her heart smote
      her, her pride vanished: she sank on his shoulder, and forgot even
      ambition; nay, while she inly murmured at his sentiment, she felt it
      breathed a sort of nobility that she could not but esteem. She strove then
      to lull to rest all her more worldly anxieties for the future; to hope
      that, cast on the exciting stage of English ambition, Godolphin must
      necessarily be stirred despite his creed; and if she sometimes doubted,
      sometimes despaired of this, she felt at least that his presence had
      become dearer to her than all things. Nay, she checked her own enthusiasm,
      her own worship of fame, since they clashed with his opinions; so
      marvellously and insensibly bad Love bowed down the proud energies and the
      lofty soul of the daughter of John Vernon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE BRIDALS.&mdash;THE ACCIDENT.&mdash;THE FIRST LAWFUL POSSESSION OF
      LOVE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was the morning on which Constance and Godolphin were to be married; it
      had been settled that they were to proceed the same day towards Florence;
      and Constance was at her toilette when her woman laid beside her a large
      bouquet of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Percy&mdash;from Mr. Godolphin, I mean?" she asked, taking them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lady; a young woman outside the palace gave them me, and bade me
      in such pretty English be sure to give them to your ladyship; and when I
      offered her money, she would not take anything, my lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Italians are a courteous people," replied Constance; and she placed
      the flowers in her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, after the ceremony, Godolphin assisted his bride into the carriage, a
      girl, wrapped in a large cloak, pressed forward for a moment. Godolphin
      had in that moment turned his head to give some order to his servant, and
      with the next the girl had sunk back into the throng that was drawn around
      the carriage&mdash;yet not before Constance had heard her murmur in deep,
      admiring, yet sorrowful tone: "Beautiful! how beautiful!&mdash;Ah me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you observe what beautiful eyes that young girl had?" asked
      Constance, as the carriage whirled off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What girl? I saw nothing but you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark! there is a noise behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin looked out; the crowd seemed collected round one person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a young woman fainted, sir!" said his servant seated behind. "She
      fell down in a fit just before the horses; but they started aside, and did
      not hurt her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is fortunate!" said Godolphin, reseating himself by his new bride;
      "drive on faster."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Florence, Godolphin revealed to Constance the outline of Lucilla's
      history, and Constance shared somewhat of the feelings with which he told
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left," said he, "in the hands of the abbess a sum to be entirely at
      Lucilla's control, whether she stay in the convent or not, and which will
      always secure to her an independence. But I confess I should like now,
      once more to visit the convent, and learn on what fate she has decided."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would do well, dear Percy," replied Constance, who from her high and
      starred sphere could stoop to no vulgar jealousy; "indeed, I think you
      could do no less."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Godolphin covered those generous lips with the sweet kisses in which
      esteem begins to mingle with passion. What has the earth like that first
      fresh union of two hearts long separated, and now blended for ever?
      However close the sympathy between woman and her lover&mdash;however each
      thinks to have learned the other&mdash;what a world is there left
      un-learned, until marriage brings all those charming confidences, that
      holy and sweet intercourse, which leaves no separate interest, no
      undivided thought! But there is one thing that distinguishes the
      conversation of young married people from that of lovers on a less sacred
      footing&mdash;they talk of the future! Other lovers talk rather of the
      past; an uncertainty pervades their hereafter; they feel they recoil from,
      it; they are sensible that their plans are not one and indivisible.' But
      married people are always laying out the "to come;" always talking over
      their plans: this often takes something away from the tenderness of
      affection, but how much it adds to its enjoyment!
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated by each other, and looking on the silver Arno, Godolphin and
      Constance, hand clasped in hand, surrendered themselves to the
      contemplation of their future happiness. "And what would be your favorite
      mode of life, dear Percy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I have now no schemings left me, Constance. With you obtained, I
      have grown a dullard, and left off dreaming. But let me see, a house in
      England&mdash;you like England&mdash;some ten or twenty miles from the
      great Babel: books, pictures, statues, and old trees that shall put us in
      mind of our Norman fathers who planted them; above all, a noisy, clear
      sunny stream gliding amidst them&mdash;deer on the opposite bank, half
      hidden amongst the fern; and rooks overhead: a privilege for eccentricity
      that would allow one to be social or solitary as one pleased; and a house
      so full of guests, that to shun them all now and then would be no affront
      to one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Constance, smiling, "go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Finished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my fair Insatiable! What more would you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this is but a country-life you have been talking of; very well in
      its way for three months in the year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Italy, then, for the other nine," returned Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Percy!&mdash;is pleasure, mere pleasure, vulgar pleasure,&mdash;to be
      really the sole end and aim of life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And action, enterprise-are these as nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin was silent, but began absently to throw pebbles into the water.
      The action reminded Constance of the first time she had ever seen him
      among his ancestral groves; and she sighed as she now gazed on a brow from
      which the effeminacy and dreaming of his life had banished much of its
      early chivalric and earnest expression.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NEWS OF LUCILLA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Godolphin was about one morning to depart for the convent to which Lucilla
      had flown, when a letter was brought to him from the abbess of the convent
      herself; it had followed him from Rome. Lucilla had left her retreat&mdash;left
      it three days before Godolphin's marriage; the abbess knew not whither,
      but believed she intended to reside in Rome. She inclosed him a note from
      Lucilla, left for him before her departure. Short but characteristic, it
      ran thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     LUCILLA TO GODOLPHIN.
</pre>
    <p>
      "I can stay here no longer; my mind will not submit to quiet; this
      inactivity wears me to madness. Besides, I want to see thy wife. I shall
      go to Rome; I shall witness thy wedding; and then&mdash;ah! what then?
      Give me back. Godolphin, oh; give me back the young pure heart I had ere I
      loved you! Then, I could take joy in all things:&mdash;now! But I will not
      repine; it is beneath me. I, the daughter of the stars, am no love-sick
      and nerveless minion of a vain regret; my pride is roused at last, and I
      feel at least the independence of being alone. Wild and roving shall be my
      future life; that lot which denies me hope, has raised me above all fear.
      Love makes us all the woman; love has left me, and something hard and
      venturous, something that belongs to they sex, has come in its stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have left me money&mdash;I thank you&mdash;I thank you&mdash;I thank
      you; my heart almost chokes me as I write this. Could you think of me so
      basely?&mdash;For shame, man! if my child&mdash;our child were living (and
      O, Percy, she had thine eyes!), I would see her starve inch by inch rather
      than touch one doit of thy bounty! But she is dead&mdash;thank God! Fear
      not for me, I shall not starve; these hands can support life. God bless
      thee&mdash;loved as thou still art! If, years hence, I should feel my end
      draw near, I will drag myself to thy country, and look once more on thy
      face before I die."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin sank down, and covered his face with his hands. Constance took
      up the letter. "Ay&mdash;read it!" said he in a hollow voice. She did so,
      and when she had finished, the proud Constance, struck by a spirit like
      her own, bathed the letter in her tears. This pleased&mdash;this touched&mdash;this
      consoled Godolphin more than the most elaborate comforting. "Poor girl!"
      said Constance, through her tears, "this must not be; she must not be left
      on the wide world to her own despairing heart. Let us both go to Rome, and
      seek her out. I will persuade her to accept what she refuses from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin pressed his wife's hand, but spoke not. They went that day to
      Rome. Lucilla had departed for Leghorn, and thence taken her passage in a
      vessel bound to the northern coasts of Europe. Perhaps she had sought her
      father's land? With that hope, in the absence of all others, they
      attempted to console themselves.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH TWO PERSONS, PERMANENTLY UNITED, DISCOVER THAT NO TIE CAN PRODUCE
      UNION OF MINDS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks passed on, and, apparently, Godolphin had reconciled himself to the
      disappearance and precarious destiny of Lucilla. It was not in his calm
      and brooding nature to show much of emotion; but there was often, even. in
      the presence of Constance, a cloud on his brow, and the fits of
      abstraction to which he had always been accustomed grew upon him more
      frequently than ever. Constance had been inured for years to the most
      assiduous, the most devoted attentions; and now, living much alone with
      Godolphin, she began somewhat to miss them; for Godolphin could be a
      passionate, a romantic, but he could not be a very watchful lover. He had
      no petits soins. Few husbands have, it is true; nor is it necessary for
      husbands in general. But Constance was not an ordinary woman; she loved
      deeply, but she loved according to her nature&mdash;as a woman proud and
      exacting must love. For Godolphin, her haughty step waxed timorous and
      vigilant; she always sprang forward the first to meet him on his return
      from his solitary ramblings, and he smiled upon her with his wonted
      gentleness but not so gratefully, thought Constance, as he ought. In
      truth, he had been too much accustomed to the eager love of Lucilla, to
      feel greatly surprised at any proof of tenderness from Constance. Thus,
      too proud to speak&mdash;to hint a complaint, Constance was nevertheless
      perpetually wounded, and by degrees (although not loving her husband less)
      she taught that love to be more concealed. Oh, that accursed secretiveness
      in women, which makes them always belie themselves!
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, too, was not without his disappointments. There was something
      so bright, so purely intellectual about Constance's character, that at
      times, when brought into constant intercourse with her, you longed for
      some human weakness&mdash;some wild, warm error on which to repose.
      Dazzling and fair as snow, like snow your eye ached to gaze upon her. She
      had, during the years of her ungenial marriage, cultivated her mind to the
      utmost; few women were so accomplished&mdash;it might be learned; her
      conversation flowed for ever in the same bright, flowery, adorned stream.
      There were times when Godolphin recollected how hard it is to read a
      volume of that Gibbon who in a page is so delightful. Her affection for
      him was intense, high, devoted; but it was wholly of the same intellectual
      spiritualised order; it seemed to Godolphin to want human warmth and
      fondness. In fact, there never was a woman who, both by original nature
      and after habits, was so purely and abstractedly "mind" as was Constance;
      there was not a single trait or taste in her character that a sensualist
      could have sneered at. Her heart was wholly Godolphin's; her mind was
      generous, sympathising, lofty; her person unrivalled in the majesty of its
      loveliness; all these, too, were Godolphin's, and yet the eternal
      something was wanting still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have brought you your hat, Percy," said Constance; "you forget the dews
      are falling fast, and your head is uncovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Percy, gently; yet Constance thought the tone might have
      been warmer. "How beautiful is this hour! Look yonder, the sun's rays
      still upon those immortal hills&mdash;that lone grey tower amongst the far
      plains&mdash;the pines around&mdash;hearken to their sighing! These are
      indeed the scenes of the Dryad and the Faun. These are scenes where we
      could melt our whole nature down to love: Nature never meant us for the
      stern and arid destinies we fulfil. Look round, Constance, in every leaf
      of her gorgeous book, how glowingly is written the one sentence, 'Love and
      be happy!' You answer not; to these thoughts you are cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They breathe too much of the Epicurean and his roseleaves for me,"
      answered Constance, smilingly. "I love better that stern old tower,
      telling of glorious strife and great deeds, than all the softer landscape,
      on which the present debasement of the south seems written."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and your English," said Godolphin, somewhat bitterly, "prate of the
      debasement of my poor Italians in a jargon that I confess almost enrages
      me. (Constance coloured and bit her lip.) Debasement! why debasement? They
      enjoy themselves: they take from life its just moral; they do not affect
      the more violent crimes; they feel their mortality, follow its common
      ends, are frivolous, contented, and die! Well; this is debasement. Be it
      so. But for what would you exchange it? The hard, cold, ferocious guilt of
      ancient Rome; the detestable hypocrisy, the secret villiany, fraud,
      murder, that stamped republican Venice? The days of glory that you lament
      are the days of the darkest guilt; and man shudders when he reads what the
      fair moralisers over the soft and idle Italy sigh to recall!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are severe," said Constance, with a pained voice. "Forgive me,
      dearest; but you are often severe on my feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was silent; the magic of the sunset was gone; they walked back
      to the house, thoughtful, and somewhat cooled towards each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day, on which the rain forbade them to stir from home, Godolphin,
      after he had remained long silent and meditating, said to Constance, who
      was busy writing letters to her political friends, in which, avoiding
      Italy and love, the scheming countess dwelt only on busy England and its
      eternal politics:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you read to me, dear Constance? my spirits are sad to-day; the
      weather affects them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance laid aside her letters, and took up one of the many books that
      strewed the table: it was a volume of one of our most popular poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate poetry," said Godolphin, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is Machiavel's history of the Prince of Lucca," said Constance,
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, read that, and see how odious is ambition," returned Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Constance read, but she warmed at what Godolphin's lip curled with
      disdain. The sentiments, however, drew him from his apathy; and presently,
      with the eloquence he could command when once excited, he poured forth the
      doctrines of his peculiar philosophy. Constance listened, delighted and
      absorbed; she did not sympathise with the thought, but she was struck with
      the genius which clothed it. "Ah!" said she, with enthusiasm, "why should
      those brilliant words be thus spoken and lost for ever? Why not stamp them
      on the living page, or why not invest them in the oratory that would
      render you illustrious and them immortal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent!" said Godolphin laughing; "the House of Commons would
      sympathise with philosophy warmly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Constance was right on the whole. But the curse of a life of pleasure
      is its aversion to useful activity. Talk of the genius that lies crushed
      and obscure in poverty! Wealth and station have also their mute Miltons
      and inglorious Hampdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! how much of deep and true wisdom do we meet among the triflers of
      the world! How much that in the stern middle walks of life would have
      obtained renown, in the withering and relaxed air of loftier ranks dies
      away unheeded! The two extremes meet in this,&mdash;the destruction of
      mental gifts.

    </h2>
    <p>
      THE RETURN TO LONDON.&mdash;THE ETERNAL NATURE OF DISAPPOINTMENT.&mdash;FANNY
      MILLINGER.&mdash;HER HOUSE AND SUPPER.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of spring, and at the approach of night, that our
      travellers entered London. After an absence of some duration, there is a
      singular emotion on returning to the roar and tumult of that vast city.
      Its bustle, its life, its wealth&mdash;the tokens of the ambition and
      commerce of the Great Island Race&mdash;have something of inconceivable
      excitement and power, after the comparative desertion and majestic
      stillness of Continental cities. Constance leaned restlessly forth from
      the window of the carriage as it whirled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that I were a man!" said she, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why?" asked Godolphin, smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why! look out on this broad theatre of universal ambition, and read the
      why. What a proud and various career lies open in this free city to every
      citizen! Look, look yonder&mdash;the old hereditary senate, still eloquent
      with high memories."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And close by it," said Godolphin, sneering, "behold the tomb!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but the tomb of great men!" said Constance, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The victims of their greatness."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause; Constance would not reply, she would scarcely listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you feel no excitement, Percy, in the hum and bustle&mdash;the
      lights, the pomp of your native city?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I am in the mart where all enjoyment may be purchased."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, fie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin drew his cloak round him, and put up the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These cursed east winds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Very true&mdash;they are the curse of the country!
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped at the stately portico of Erpingham House. Godolphin
      felt a little humiliated at being indebted to another&mdash;to a woman,
      for so splendid a tenement; but Constance, not penetrating into this
      sentiment, hastened up the broad stairs, and said, pointing to a door that
      led to her boudoir,
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that room cabinets have been formed and shaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin laughed; he was alive only to the vanity of the boast, because
      he shared not the enthusiasm; this was Constance's weak point: her dark
      eye flashed fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's nothing bores a man more than the sort of uneasy quiet that
      follows a day's journey. Godolphin took his hat, and yawningly stretching
      himself, nodded to Constance, and moved to the door; they were in her
      dressing-room at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what, Percy, you cannot be going out now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I am, my love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where, in Heaven's name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To White's, to learn the news of the Opera, and the strength of the
      Ballet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had just rung for lights to show you the house!" said Constance,
      disappointed, and half-reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy, Constance! damp rooms and east winds together are too much. House,
      indeed! what can there be worth seeing in your English drawing-rooms after
      the marble palaces of Italy? Any commands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None!" said Constance, sinking back into her chair, with the tears in her
      eyes. Godolphin did not perceive them; he was only displeased by the cold
      tone of her answer, and he shut the door, muttering to himself&mdash;"Was
      there ever such indelicate ostentation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And thus," said Constance, bitterly, "I return to England; friendless,
      unloved, solitary in my schemes and my heart as I was before. Awake, my
      soul! thou art my sole strength, my sole support. Weak, weak that I was,
      to love this man in spite of&mdash;Well, well, I am not sunk so low as to
      regret."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she wiped away a few tears, and turning with a strong effort
      from softer thoughts, leaned her cheek on her hand, and gazing on the
      fire, surrendered herself to the sterner and more plotting meditations
      which her return to the circle of her old ambition had at first called
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Godolphin sauntered into the then arch-club of St. James's, that
      reservoir of idle exquisites and kid-gloved politicians. There are two
      classes of popular men in London; the sprightly, joyous, good-humoured
      set; the quiet, gentle, sarcastic herd. The one are fellows called
      devilish good&mdash;the other, fellows called devilish gentleman like. To
      the latter class belonged Godolphin. As he had never written a book, nor
      set up for a genius, his cleverness was tacitly allowed to be no
      impediment to his good qualities. Nothing atones for the sin, in the eyes
      of those young gentlemen who create for their contemporaries reputation,
      of having in any way distinguished oneself. "He's such a d&mdash;d bore,
      that man with his books and poetry," said an arch-dandy of Byron, just
      after Childe Harold had turned the heads of the women. There happened to
      be a knot assembled at White's when Godolphin entered; they welcomed him
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wish you joy, old fellow," said one. "Bless me, Godolphin! well, I am
      delighted to see you," cried another. "So, you have monopolised Lady
      Erpingham!&mdash;lucky dog!" whispered a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, his vanity soothed by the reception he met with, spent his
      evening at the Club. The habit begun, became easy&mdash;Godolphin spent
      many evenings at his club. Constance, running the round of her
      acquaintance, was too proud to complain. Perhaps complaint would not have
      mended the matter: but one word of delicate tenderness, or one look that
      asked for his society, and White's would have been forsaken! Godolphin
      secretly resented the very evenness of temper he had once almost
      overprized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Godolphin," one evening whispered a young lord, "we sup at the little
      actress's,&mdash;the Millinger; you remember the Millinger? You must come;
      you are an old favourite, you know: she'll be so glad to see you,&mdash;all
      innocent, by the way: Lady Erpingham need not be jealous&mdash;(jealous!
      Constance jealous of Fanny Millinger!) all innocent. Come, I'll drive you
      there; my cab is at the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything better than a lecture on ambition," thought Godolphin; and he
      consented. Godolphin's friend was a lively young nobleman, of that
      good-natured, easy, uncaptious temper, which a clever, susceptible,
      indolent man often likes better than comrades more intellectual, because
      he has not to put himself out of his way in the comradeship. Lord Falconer
      rattled on, as they drove along the brilliant streets, through a thousand
      topics, of which Godolphin heard as much as he pleased; and Falconer was
      of that age and those spirits when a listener may be easily dispensed
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at a little villa at Brompton: there was a little garden
      round it, and a little bower in one corner, all kept excessively neat; and
      the outside of the house had just been painted white from top to bottom;
      and there was a veranda to the house; and the windows were plate-glass,
      with mahogany sashes&mdash;only, here and there, a Gothic casement was
      stuck in by way of looking "tasty;" and through one window on the
      ground-floor, the lights shining within, showed crimson silk and gilded
      chairs, and all sorts of finery&mdash;Louis Quatorze in a nutshell! The
      reader knows the sort of house as well as if he had lived in it. Ladies of
      Fanny Millinger's turn of mind always choose the same kind of habitation.
      It is astonishing what a unanimity of taste they have; and young men about
      town call it "taste" too, and imitate the fashion in their own little
      tusculums in Chapel street.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having threaded a Gothic hall four feet by eight and an oval
      conservatory with a river-god in the middle, the two visitors found
      themselves in the presence of Fanny Millinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin had certainly felt no small curiosity to see again the frank,
      fair, laughing face which had shone on his boyhood, and his mind ran
      busily back to that summer evening when, with a pulse how different from
      its present languid tenor, and a heart burning with ardour and the pride
      of novel independence, the young adventurer first sallied on the world. He
      drew back involuntarily as he now gazed on the actress: she had kept the
      promise of her youth, and grown round and full in her proportions. She was
      extravagantly dressed, but not with an ungraceful, although a theatrical
      choice: her fair hands and arms were covered with jewels, and that
      indescribable air which betrays the stage was far more visibly marked in
      her deportment than when Godolphin first knew her; yet still there was the
      same freedom as of old, the same joyousness, and good-humoured
      carelessness in her manner, and in the silver ring of her voice as she
      greeted Falconer, and turned to question him as to his friend. Godolphin
      dropped his cloak, and the next moment, with a pretty scream, quite
      stage-effect, and yet quite natural, the actress had thrown herself into
      his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! but I forgot," said she presently, with a mock salutation of respect,
      "you are married now; there will be no more cakes and ale. Ah! what long
      years since we met; yet I have never quite forgotten you, although the
      stage requires all one's memory for one's new parts. Alas! your hair&mdash;it
      was so beautiful, it has lost half its curl, and grown thin. Very rude in
      me to say so, but I always speak the truth, and my heart warms to see you,
      so all its thoughts thaw out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Lord Falconer, who had been playing with a little muffy sort
      of dog, "you'll recollect me presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! Oh! one never thinks of you, except when you speak, and then one
      recollects you&mdash;to look at the clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, Fanny&mdash;very good, Fan: and when do you expect Windsor?&mdash;He
      ought to be here soon. Tell me, do you like him really?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like him!&mdash;yes, excessively; just the word for him&mdash;for you
      all. If love were thrown into the stream of life, my little sail would be
      upset in an instant. But in truth, what with dressing, and playing, and
      all the grave business of life, I am not idle enough to love. And oh,
      Godolphin, I'm so improved! Ask Lord Falconer, if I don't sing like an
      angel, although my voice is hardly strong enough to go round a loo-table;
      but on the stage, one learns to dispense with all qualities. It is a
      curious thing, that fictitious existence, side by side with the real one!
      We live in enchantment, Percy, and enjoy what the poets pretend to."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreaming Godolphin was struck by the remark. He was surprised, also,
      to see how much Fanny remained the same. A life of gaiety had not debased
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Windsor came next, an Irishman of five-and-forty, not like his
      countrymen in aught save wit. Thin, small, shrivelled, but up to his ears
      in knowledge of the world, and with a jest for ever on his tongue: rich
      and gay,&mdash;he was always popular, and he made the most of his little
      life without being an absolute rascal. Next dropped in the handsome
      Frenchman De Damville; next, the young gambler, St. John; next two ladies,
      both actresses; and the party was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper was in keeping with the house; the best wines, excellent viands&mdash;the
      actress had grown rich. Wit, noise, good-humour, anecdote, flashed round
      with the champagne; and Godolphin, exhilarated into a second youth,
      fancied himself once more the votary of pleasure.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L.
    </h2>
    <p>
      GODOLPHIN'S SOLILOQUY.&mdash;HE BECOMES A MAN OF PLEASURE AND A PATRON OF
      THE ARTS.&mdash;A NEW CHARACTER SHADOWED FORTH; FOR AS WE ADVANCE, WHETHER
      IN LIFE OR ITS REPRESENTATIONS, CHARACTERS ARE MORE FAINT AND DIMLY DRAWN
      THAN IN THE EARLIER PART OF OUR CAREER.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Godolphin, the next morning, as he soliloquised over his
      lonely breakfast-table&mdash;lonely, for the hours of the restless
      Constance were not those of the luxurious and indolent Godolphin, and she
      was already in her carriage, nay, already closeted with an intriguing
      ambassadress&mdash;"yes, I have passed two eras of life&mdash;the first of
      romance, the second of contemplation; once my favourite study was poetry&mdash;next
      philosophy. Now, returned to my native country, rich, settled, yet young,
      new objects arise to me; not that vulgar and troublous ambition (which is
      to make a toil of life) that Constance suggests, but a more warm and vivid
      existence than that I have lately dreamed away. Let luxury and pleasure
      now be to me what solitude and thought were. I have been too long the
      solitary, I will learn to be social."
    </p>
    <p>
      Agreeably to this resolution, Godolphin returned with avidity to the
      enjoyment of the world; he found himself courted, he courted society in
      return. Erpingham House had been for years the scene of fascination: who
      does not recollect the yet greater refinement which its new lord threw
      over its circles? A delicate and just conception of the fine arts had
      always characterised Godolphin. He now formed that ardour for collecting,
      common to the more elegant order of minds. From his beloved Italy he
      imported the most beautiful statues&mdash;his cabinets were filled with
      gems&mdash;his walls glowed with the triumphs of the canvas&mdash;the
      showy but heterogeneous furniture of Erpingham House gave way to a more
      classic and perfect taste. The same fastidiousness which, in the affairs
      of the heart, had characterised Godolphin's habits and sentiments,
      characterised his new pursuits; the same thirst for the Ideal, the same
      worship of the Beautiful, and aspirations after the Perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not in Constance's nature to admit this smaller ambition; her taste
      was pure but not minute; she did not descend to the philosophy of detail.
      But she was glad still to see that Godolphin could be aroused to the
      discovery of an active object; and, although she sighed to perceive his
      fine genius fritted away on the trifles of the virtuoso&mdash;although she
      secretly regretted the waste of her great wealth (which afforded to
      political ambition so High an advantage) on the mute marble, and what she
      deemed, nor unjustly, frivolous curiosities&mdash;she still never
      interfered with Godolphin's caprices, conscious that, to his delicacy, a
      single objection to his wishes on the score of expense would have reminded
      him of what she wished him most to forget&mdash;viz., that the means of
      this lavish expenditure were derived from her. She hoped that his mind,
      once fairly awakened, would soon grow sated with the acquisition of
      baubles, and at length sigh for loftier objects; and, in the meanwhile,
      she plunged into her old party plots and ambitions intrigues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erpingham House, celebrated as ever for the beauty of its queen and for
      the political nature of its entertainments, received a new celebrity from
      its treasures of art, and the spiritual wit and grace with which Godolphin
      invested its attractions. Among the crowd of its guests there was one whom
      its owners more particularly esteemed&mdash;Stainforth Radclyffe was still
      considerably under thirty, but already a distinguished man. At school he
      had been distinguished; at college distinguished, and now in the world of
      science distinguished also. Beneath a quiet, soft, and cold exterior, he
      concealed the most resolute and persevering ambition; and this ambition
      was the governing faculty of his soul. His energies were undistracted by
      small objects; for he went little into general society, and he especially
      sought in his studies those pursuits which nerve and brace the mind. He
      was a profound thinker, a deep political economist, an accurate financier,
      a judge of the intricacies of morals and legislation&mdash;for to his mere
      book studies he added an instinctive penetration into men; and when from
      time to time he rejoined the world, he sought out those most distinguished
      in the sciences he had cultivated, and by their lights corrected his own.
      In him there was nothing desultory or undetermined; his conduct was
      perpetual calculation. He did nothing but with an eye to a final object;
      and when, to the superficial, he seemed most to wander from the road their
      prudence would have suggested, he was only seeking the surest and shortest
      paths. Yet his ambition was not the mere vulgar thirst for getting on in
      the world; he cared little for the paltry place, the petty power which may
      reward what are called aspiring young men. His clear sight penetrated to
      objects that seemed wrapped in shade to all others; and to those only&mdash;distant,
      but vast and towering,&mdash;he deigned to attach his desires. He cared
      not for small and momentary rewards; and while always (for he knew its
      necessity) uppermost on the tide of the hour, he had neither joy nor
      thought for the petty honours for which he was envied, and by which he was
      supposed to be elated. Always occupied and always thoughtful, he went, as
      I have just said, very little into the gay world, and was not very well
      formed to shine in it when there; for trifles require the whole man as
      much as matters of importance. He did not want either wit or polish, but
      he tasked his powers too severely on great subjects not to be sometimes
      dull upon small ones: yet, when he was either excited or at home, he was
      not without&mdash;what man of genius is?&mdash;his peculiar powers of
      conversation. There was in this young dark, brooding, stern man, that
      which had charmed Constance at first sight; she thought to recognise a
      nature like her own, and Radclyffe's venturous spirit exulted in a commune
      with hers. Their politics were the same; their ultimate ends not very
      unlike; and their common ambition furnished them with an eternity of
      topics and schemes. Radclyffe was Constance's guest;&mdash;but Godolphin
      soon grew attached to the young politician, though he shrugged his
      shoulders at his opinions. In youth, Godolphin had been a Tory&mdash;now,
      if anything, he was a Tory still. Such a political creed was perhaps the
      natural result of his philosophical belief. Constance, Whig by profession,
      ultra-Liberal in reality, still however gave the character to the politics
      of the house; and the easy Godolphin thought politics the veriest of all
      the trifles which a man could leave to the discretion of the lady of his
      household. We may judge, therefore, of the quiet, complacent amusement he
      felt in the didactics of Radclyffe or the declamations of Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a dangerous, scheming woman, believe me," said the Duchess of
      &mdash;&mdash; to her great husband, one morning, when Constance left her
      Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! women are never dangerous."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      GODOLPHIN'S COURSE OF LIFE.&mdash;INFLUENCE OF OPINION AND OF RIDICULE ON
      THE MINDS OF PRIVILEGED ORDERS.&mdash;LADY EHPINGITAM'S FRIENDSHIP WITH
      GEORGE THE FOURTH.&mdash;HIS MANNER OF LIVING.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course of life which Godolphin now led, was exactly that which it is
      natural for a very rich intellectual man to indulge&mdash;voluptuous but
      refined. He was arriving at that age when the poetry of the heart
      necessarily decays. Wealth almost unlimited was at his command; he had no
      motive for exertion; and he now sought in pleasure that which he had
      formerly asked from romance. As his faculties and talents had no other
      circle for display than that which "society" affords; so by slow degrees,
      society&mdash;its applause and its regard&mdash;became to him of greater
      importance than his "philosophy dreamt of." Whatever the circle we live
      amongst, the public opinion of that circle will, sooner or later, obtain a
      control over us. This is the reason why a life of pleasure makes even the
      strongest mind frivolous at last. The lawyer, the senator, the magi of
      letters, all are insensibly guided&mdash;moulded&mdash;formed&mdash;by the
      judgment of the tribe they belong to, and the circle in which they move.
      Still more is it the case with the idlers of the great world, amongst whom
      the only main staple of talk is "themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the last-named set, Ridicule being more strong and fearful a deity
      than she is amongst the cultivators of the graver occupations of life,
      reduces the inmates, by a constant dread of incurring her displeasure, to
      a more monotonous and regular subjection to the judgment of others.
      Ridicule is the stifler of all energy amongst those she controls. After
      man's position in society is once established&mdash;after he has arrived
      at a certain age&mdash;he does not like to hazard any intellectual
      enterprise which may endanger the quantum of respect or popularity at
      present allotted to him. He does not like to risk a failure in parliament&mdash;a
      caustic criticism in literature: he does not like to excite new
      jealousies, and provoke angry rivals where he now finds complaisant
      inferiors. The most admired authors, the most respected members of either
      house, now looked up to Godolphin as a man of wit and genius; a man whose
      house, whose wealth, whose wife, gave him an influence few individuals
      enjoy. Why risk all this respect by provoking comparison? Among the first
      in one line, why sink into the probability of being second-rate in
      another?
    </p>
    <p>
      This motive, which secretly governs half the aristocracy&mdash;the
      cleverer half, viz., the more diffident and the more esteemed; which
      leaves to the obtuse and the vain, a despised and unenviable notoriety;
      added new force to Godolphin's philosophical indifference to ambition.
      Perhaps, had his situation been less brilliant, or had he persevered in
      that early affection for solitude which youth loves as the best nurse to
      its dreams, he might now, in attaining an age when ambition, often dumb
      before, usually begins to make itself heard, have awakened to a more
      resolute and aspiring temperament of mind. But, as it was, courted and
      surrounded by all the enjoyments which are generally the reward to which
      exertion looks, even an ambitious man might have forgotten his nature. No
      wound to his vanity, no feeling that he was underrated (that great spur to
      proud minds) excited him to those exertions we undertake in order to belie
      calumny. He was "the glass of fashion," at once popular and admired; and
      his good fortune in marrying the celebrated, the wealthy, the beautiful
      Countess of Erpingham was, as success always is, considered the proof of
      his genius, and the token of his merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly true, that a secret and mutual disappointment rankled
      beneath the brilliant lot of the husband and wife. Godolphin exacted from
      Constance more softness, more devotion, more compliance than belonged to
      her nature; and Constance, on the other hand, ceased not to repine that
      she found in Godolphin no sympathy with her objects, and no feeling for
      her enthusiasm. As there was little congenial in their pursuits, the one
      living for pleasure, the other for ambition, so there could be no
      congeniality in their intercourse. They loved each other still; they loved
      each other warmly; they never quarrelled; for the temper of Constance was
      mild, and that of Godolphin generous: but neither believed there was much
      love on the other side; and both sought abroad that fellowship and those
      objects they had not in common at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was a great favourite with the reigning king; she was constantly
      invited to the narrow circle of festivities at Windsor. Godolphin, who
      avoided the being bored as the greatest of earthly evils, could not bow
      down his tastes and habits to any exact and precise order of life, however
      distinguished the circle in which it became the rule. Thirsting to be
      amused, he could not conjugate the active verb "to amuse." No man was more
      fitted to adorn a court, yet no man could less play the courtier. He
      admired the manners of the sovereign,&mdash;he did homage to the natural
      acuteness of his understanding; but, accustomed as he was to lay down the
      law in society, he was too proud to receive it from another,&mdash;a
      common case among those who live with the great by right and not through
      sufferance. His pride made him fear to seem a parasite; and, too
      chivalrous to be disloyal, he was too haughty to be subservient. In fact,
      he was thoroughly formed to be the Great Aristocrat,&mdash;a career
      utterly distinct from that of the hanger-on upon a still greater man; and
      against his success at court, he had an obstacle no less in the inherent
      fierte of his nature, than in the acquired philosophy of his cynicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, at first, was civil enough to Lady Erpingham's husband; but he
      had penetration enough to see that he was not adequately admired: and on
      the first demonstration of royal coolness, Godolphin, glad of an excuse,
      forswore Castle and Pavilion for ever, and left Constance to enjoy alone
      the honours of the regal hospitality. The world would have insinuated
      scandal; but there was that about Constance's beauty which there is said
      by one of the poets to belong to an angel's&mdash;it struck the heart, but
      awed the senses.

      RADCLYFFE AND GODOLPHIN CONVERSE.&mdash;THE VARIETIES OF AMBITION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said Godolphin to Radclyffe, as they were one day riding
      together among the green lanes that border the metropolis&mdash;"I don't
      know what to do with myself this evening. Lady Erpingham is gone to
      Windsor; I have no dinner engagement, and I am wearied of balls. Shall we
      dine together, and go to the play quietly, as we might have done some ten
      years ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing I should like better;&mdash;and the theatre&mdash;are you fond of
      it now? I think I have heard you say that it once made your favorite
      amusement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I still like it passably," answered Godolphin; "but the gloss is gone
      from the delusion. I am grown mournfully fastidious. I must have excellent
      acting&mdash;an excellent play. A slight fault&mdash;a slight deviation
      from nature&mdash;robs me of my content at the whole."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same fault in your character pervading all things," said Radclyffe,
      half smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said Godolphin, yawning;&mdash;"but have you seen my new Canova?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: I care nothing for statues, and I know nothing of the Fine Arts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a confession!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is a rare confession: but I suspect that the Arts, like truffles
      and olives, are an acquired taste. People talk themselves into admiration,
      where at first they felt indifference. But how can you, Godolphin, with
      your talents, fritter away life on these baubles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are civil," said Godolphin, impatiently. "Allow me to tell you that
      it is your objects I consider baubles. Your dull, plodding, wearisome
      honours; a name in the newspapers&mdash;a place, perhaps, in the Ministry&mdash;purchased
      by a sacrificed youth and a degraded manhood&mdash;a youth in labour, a
      manhood in schemes. No, Radclyffe! give me the bright, the glad sparkle of
      existence; and, ere the sad years of age and sickness, let me at least
      enjoy. That is wisdom! Your creed is&mdash;But I will not imitate your
      rudeness!" and Godolphin laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," replied Radclyffe, "you do your best to enjoy yourself. You
      live well and fare sumptuously: your house is superb, your villa
      enchanting. Lady Erpingham is the handsomest woman of her time: and, as if
      that were not enough, half the fine women in London admit you at their
      feet. Yet you are not happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay: but who is?" cried Godolphin, energetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," said Radclyffe, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!&mdash;humph!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You disbelieve me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no right to do so: but are you not ambitious? And is not ambition
      full of anxiety, care,&mdash;mortification at defeat, disappointment in
      success? Does not the very word ambition&mdash;that is, a desire to be
      something you are not&mdash;prove you discontented with what you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak of a vulgar ambition," said Radclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most august sage!&mdash;and what species of ambition is yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that which you describe. You speak of the ambition for self; my
      ambition is singular&mdash;it is the ambition for others. Some years ago I
      chanced to form an object in what I considered the welfare of my race. You
      smile. Nay, I boast no virtue in my dreams; but philanthropy was my hobby,
      as statues may be yours. To effect this object, I see great changes are
      necessary: I desire, I work for these great changes. I am not blind, in
      the meanwhile, to glory. I desire, on the contrary, to obtain it! But it
      would only please me if it came from certain sources. I want to feel that
      I may realise what I attempt; and wish for that glory that comes from the
      permanent gratitude of my species, not that which springs from the
      momentary applause. Now, I am vain, very vain: vanity was, some years ago,
      the strongest characteristic of my nature. I do not pretend to conquer the
      weakness, but to turn it towards my purposes. I am vain enough to wish to
      shine, but the light must come from deeds I think really worthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well!" said Godolphin, a little interested in spite of himself:
      "but ambition of one sort resembles ambition of another, inasmuch as it
      involves perpetual harassment and humiliations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," answered Radclyffe;&mdash;"because when a man is striving for
      what he fancies a laudable object, the goodness of his intentions comforts
      him for a failure in success, whereas your selfishly ambitious man has no
      consolation in his defeats; he is humbled by the external world, and has
      no inner world to apply to for consolation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, man!" said Godolphin, almost bitterly, "how dost thou eternally
      deceive thyself! Here is the thirst for power, and it calls itself the
      love of mankind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me," said Radclyffe, so earnestly, and with so deep a meaning in
      his grave, bright eye, that Godolphin was staggered from his scepticism;&mdash;"believe
      me, they may be distinct passions, and yet can be united."

      CHAPTER LIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      FANNY BEHIND THE SCENES.&mdash;REMINISCENCES OF YOUTH.&mdash;THE
      UNIVERSALITY OF TRICK.&mdash;THE SUPPER AT FANNY MILLINGER'S.&mdash;TALK
      ON A THOUSAND MATTERS, EQUALLY LIGHT AND TRUE.&mdash;FANNY'S SONG.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was Pizarro, and Fanny Millinger acted Cora, Godolphin and
      Radclyffe went behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Fanny, as she stood in her white Peruvian dress, waiting her
      turn to re-enter the stage,&mdash;"ah, Godolphin! this reminds me of old
      times. How many years have passed since you used to take such pleasure in
      this mimic life! Well do I remember your musing eye and thoughtful brow
      bent kindly on me from the stage-box yonder: and do you recollect how
      prettily you used to moralise on the deserted scenes when the play was
      over? And you sometimes waited on these very boards to escort me home.
      Those times have changed. Heigh-ho!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Fanny, we have passed through new worlds of feeling since then. Could
      life be to us now what it was at that time, we might love each other anew:
      but tell me, Fanny, has not the experience of life made you a wiser woman?
      Do you not seek more to enjoy the present&mdash;to pluck Tirne's fruit on
      the bough, ere yet the ripeness is gone? I do. I dreamed away my youth&mdash;I
      strive to enjoy my manhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Fanny, with that quickness with which, in matters of the
      heart, women beat all our philosophy&mdash;"then I can prophesy that,
      since we parted, you have loved or lost some one. Regret, which converts
      the active mind into the dreaming temper, makes the dreamer hurry into
      activity, whether of business or of pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," said Radclyffe, as a shade darkened his stern brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," said Godolphin thoughtfully, and Lucille's image smote his heart
      like an avenging conscience. "Right," repeated he, turning aside and
      soliloquising; "and those words from an idle tongue have taught me some of
      the motives of my present conduct. But away reflection! I have resolved to
      forswear it. My pretty Cora!" said he, aloud, as he turned back to the
      actress, "you are a very De Stael in your wisdom: but let us not be wise;
      'tis the worst of our follies. Do you not give us one of your charming
      suppers to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure: your friend will join us. He was once the gayest of the gay;
      but years and fame have altered him a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Radclyffe gay! Bah!" said Godolphin surprised. "Ay, you may well look
      astonished," said Fanny, archly; "but note that smile&mdash;it tells of
      old days."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Godolphin turning to his friend, saw indeed on the thin lip of that
      earnest face a smile so buoyant, so joyous, that it seemed as if the whole
      character of the man were gone: but while he gazed, the smile vanished,
      and Radclyffe gravely declined the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora was now on the stage: a transport of applause shook the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How well she acts!" said Radclyffe warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," answered Godolphin, as with folded arms he looked quietly on; "but
      what a lesson in the human heart does good acting teach us! Mark that
      glancing eye&mdash;that heaving breast&mdash;that burst of passion&mdash;that
      agonised voice: the spectators are in tears! The woman's whole soul is in
      her child! Not a bit of it! She feels no more than the boards we tread on:
      she is probably thinking of the lively supper we shall have; and when she
      comes off the stage, she will cry, 'Did I not act it well?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said Radclyffe, "she probably feels while she depicts the feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not she: years ago she told me the whole science of acting was trick; and
      trick&mdash;trick&mdash;trick it is, on the stage or off. The noble art of
      oratory&mdash;(noble forsooth!)&mdash;is just the same: philosophy, poetry&mdash;all,
      all hypocrisy. 'Damn the moon!' said B&mdash;&mdash; to me, as we once
      stood gazing on it at Venice; 'it always gives me the ague: but I have
      described it well in my poetry, Godolphin&mdash;eh?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;," began Radclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But me no buts," interrupted Godolphin, with the playful pertinacity
      which he made so graceful: "you are younger than I am; when you have lived
      as long, you shall have a right to contradict my system&mdash;not before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin joined the supper party. Like Godolphin's, Fanny's life was the
      pursuit of pleasure: she lavished on it, in proportion to her means, the
      same cost and expense, though she wanted the same taste and refinement.
      Generous and profuse, like all her tribe&mdash;like all persons who win
      money easily&mdash;she was charitable to all and luxurious in herself. The
      supper was attended by four male guests&mdash;Godolphin, Saville, Lord
      Falconer; and Mr. Windsor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early summer: the curtains were undrawn, the windows were half
      opened, and the moonlight slept on the little grassplot that surrounded
      the house. The guests were in high spirits. "Fill me this goblet," cried
      Godolphin; "champagne is the boy's liquor; I will return to it con amore.
      Fanny, let us pledge each other: stay: a toast!&mdash;What shall it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope till old age, and Memory afterwards," said Fanny, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw! theatricals still, Fan?" growled Saville, who had placed a large
      screen between himself and the window; "no sentiment between friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out on you, Saville," said Godolphin; "as well might you say no music out
      of the opera; these verbal prettinesses colour conversation. But your
      roues are so d&mdash;&mdash;d prosaic, you want us to walk to Vice without
      a flower by the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vice indeed!" cried Saville. "I abjure your villanous appellatives. It
      was in your companionship that I lost my character, and now you turn
      king's evidence against the poor devil you seduced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" cried Godolphin gaily; "you remind me of the advice of the
      Spanish hidalgo to a servant: always choose a master with a good memory:
      for 'if he does not pay, he will at least remember that he owes you.' In
      future, I shall take care to herd only with those who recollect, after
      they are finally debauched, all the good advice I gave them beforehand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meanwhile," said the pretty Fanny, with her arch mouth half-full of
      chicken, "I shall recollect that Mr. Saville drinks his wine without
      toasts&mdash;as being a useless delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wine," said Mr. Windsor, sententiously, "wine is just the reverse of
      love. Your old topers are all for coming at once, to the bottle, and your
      old lovers for ever mumbling the toast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See what you have' brought on yourself, Saville, by affecting a joke upon
      me," said Godolphin. "Come, let us make it up: we fell out with the toast&mdash;let
      us be reconciled by the glass.&mdash;Champagne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, anything for a quiet life,&mdash;even champagne," said Saville, with
      a mock air of patience, and dropping his sharp features into a state of
      the most placid repose. "Your wits are so very severe. Yes, champagne if
      you please. Fanny, my love," and Saville made a wry face as he put down
      the scarce-tasted glass; "go on&mdash;another joke, if you please; I now
      find I can bear your satire better, at least, than your wine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was all bustle: it is in these things that the actress differs from
      the lady&mdash;there is no quiet in her. "Another bottle of champagne:&mdash;what
      can have happened to this?" Poor Fanny was absolutely pained. Saville
      enjoyed it, for he always revenged a jest by an impertinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said Godolphin, "our friend does but joke. Your champagne is
      excellent, Fanny. Well, Saville, and where is young Greenhough? He is
      vanished. Report says he was marked down in your company, and has not
      risen since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Report is the civilest jade in the world. According to her all the
      pigeons disappear in my fields. But, seriously speaking, Greenhough is off&mdash;gone
      to America&mdash;over head and ears in debt&mdash;debts of honor. Now,"
      said Saville, very slowly, "there's the difference between the gentleman
      and the parvenu; the gentleman, when all is lost, cuts his throat: the
      parvenu only cuts his creditors. I am really very angry with Greenhough
      that he did not destroy himself. A young man under my protection and all:
      so d&mdash;&mdash;d ungrateful in him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was not much in your debt&mdash;eh?" said Lord Falconer, speaking for
      the first time as the wine began to get into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saville looked hard at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Falconer, a pinch of snuff: there is something singularly happy in
      your question; so much to the point: you have great knowledge of the world&mdash;great.
      He was very much in my debt. I introduced the vulgar dog into the world,
      and he owes me all the thousands he had the Honor to lose in good
      society!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, Percy," continued Saville, "do you know, by the way, that my
      poor dear friend Jasmin is dead? died after a hearty game of whist. He had
      just time to cry 'four by honours' when death trumped him. It was a great
      shock to me: he was the second best player at Graham's. Those sudden
      deaths are very awful&mdash;especially with the game in one's hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very mortifying, indeed," seriously said Lord Falconer, who had just been
      initiated into whist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis droll," said Saville, "to see how often the last words of a man
      tally with his life; 'tis like the moral to the fable. The best instance I
      know is in Lord Chesterfield, whose fine soul went out in that sublime and
      inimitable sentence&mdash;`Give Mr. Darrell a chair.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital," cried Lord Falconer. "Saville, a game at ecarte."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lion in the Tower looked at the lapdog, so in all the compassion of
      contempt looked Saville on Lord Falconer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Infelix puer!" muttered Godolphin; "Infelix puer atque, impar congressus
      Achilli."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," said Saville at last. "Yet, no&mdash;we've been
      talking of death&mdash;such topics waken a man's conscience, Falconer, I
      never play for less than&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ponies!&mdash;I know it!" cried Falconer, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ponies&mdash;less than chargers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chargers&mdash;what are chargers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole receipts of an Irish peer, Lord Falconer; and I make it a point
      never to lose the first game."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such men are dangerous," said Mr. Windsor, with his eyes shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Night!" cried Godolphin, springing up theatrically, "thou wert made for
      song, and moonlight, and laughter&mdash;but woman's laughter. Fanny, a
      song&mdash;the pretty quaint song you sang me, years ago, in praise of a
      town love and an easy life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, who had been in the pouts ever since Saville had blamed the
      champagne&mdash;for she was very anxious to be of bon ton in her own
      little way&mdash;now began to smile once more; and, as the moon played on
      her arch face, she seated herself at the piano, and, glancing at
      Godolphin, sang the following song:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          LOVE COURTS THE PLEASURES.
               I.
     Believe me, Love was never made
          In deserts to abide;
     Leave Age to take the sober shade,
          And Youth the sunny side.

               II.
     Love dozes by the purling brook,
          No friend to lonely places;
     Or, if he toy with Strephon's crook,
          His Chloes are the Graces.

               III.
     Forsake 'The Flaunting Town!' Alas!
          Be cells for saints, my own love!
     The wine of life's a social glass,
          Nor may be quaffed alone, love.

               IV.
     Behold the dead and solemn sea,
          To which our beings flow;
     Let waves that soon so dark must be
          Catch every glory now.

               V.
     I would not chain that heart to this
          To sicken at the rest;
     The cage we close a prison is,
          The open cage a nest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE CAREER OF CONSTANCE.&mdash;REAL STATE OF HER FEELINGS TOWARDS
      GODOLPHIN.&mdash;RAPID SUCCESSION OF POLITICAL EVENTS.&mdash;CANNING'S
      ADMINISTRATION.&mdash;CATHOLIC QUESTION.&mdash;LORD GREY'S SPEECH.&mdash;CANNING'S
      DEATH.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in scenes like these, alternated with more refined and polished
      dissipation, Godolphin lavished away his life, Constance, became more and
      more powerful as one of the ornaments of a great political party. Few
      women in England ever mixed more actively in politics than Lady Erpingham,
      or with more remarkable ability. Her friends were out of office, it is
      true; but she saw the time approaching rapidly when their opinions must
      come into power. She bad begun to love, for itself, the scheming of
      political ambition, and in any country but England she would have been a
      conspirator, and in old times might have risen to be a queen; but as it
      was, she was only a proud, discontented woman. She knew, too, that it was
      all she could be&mdash;all that her sex allowed her to be&mdash;yet did
      she not the less straggle and toil on. The fate of her father still
      haunted her; her promise and his death-bed still rose oft and solemnly
      before leer; the humiliations she had known in her early condition&mdash;the
      homage that had attended her later career&mdash;still cherished in her
      haughty soul indignation at the faction he had execrated, and little less
      of the mighty class which that faction represented. The system of
      "fashion" she had so mainly contributed to strengthen, and which was
      originally by her intended to build up a standard of opinion, independent
      of mere rank, and in defiance of mere wealth, she saw polluted and debased
      by the nature of its followers, into a vulgar effrontery, which was worse
      than the more quiet dulness it had attempted to supplant. Yet still she
      was comforted by the thought that through this system lay the way to more
      wholesome changes. The idols of rank and wealth once broken, she believed
      that a pure and sane worship must ultimately be established. Doubtless in
      the old French regime there were many women who thought like her, but
      there were none who acted like her&mdash;deliberately, and with an end.
      What an excellent, what a warning picture is contained in the entertaining
      Memoirs of Count Segur! how admirably that agreeable gossip develops the
      state of mind among the nobility of France!&mdash;"merry censurers of the
      old customs"&mdash;"enchanted by the philosophy of Voltaire"&mdash;"ridiculing
      the old system"&mdash;"embracing liberality as a fashion," and "gaily
      treading a soil bedecked with flowers, which concealed a precipice from
      their view!" In England, there are fewer flowers, and the precipice will
      be less fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain disappointment which had attended her marriage with Godolphin,
      and the disdainful resentment she felt at the pleasures that allured him
      from her, tended yet more to deepen at once her distaste for the habits of
      a frivolous society, and to nerve and concentrate her powers of political
      intrigue. Her mind grew more and more masculine; her dark eye burnt with a
      sterner fire; the sweet mouth was less prodigal of its smiles; and that
      air of dignity which she had always possessed, grew harder in its
      character, and became command.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change did not tend to draw Godolphin nearer to her. He, so
      susceptible to coldness, so refining, so exacting, believed fully that she
      loved him no more&mdash;that she repented the marriage she had contracted.
      His pride was armed against her; and he sought more eagerly those scenes
      where all, for the admired, the gallant, the sparkling Godolphin, wore
      smiles and sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another matter that rankled in his breast with peculiar
      bitterness. He had wished to raise a large sum of money (in the purchase
      of some celebrated works of art), which could only be raised with Lady
      Erpingham's consent. When he had touched upon the point to her, she had
      not refused, but she had hesitated. She seemed embarrassed, and, he
      thought, discontented. His delicacy took alarm, and he never referred to
      the question again; but he was secretly much displeased with her reluctant
      manner on that occasion. Nothing the proud so little forget as a coolness
      conceived upon money matters: In this instance, Godolphin afterwards
      discovered that he had wronged Constance, and misinterpreted the cause of
      her reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet as time flew on for both, both felt a yearning of the heart towards
      each other; and had they been thrown upon a desert island&mdash;had there
      been full leisure, full opportunity, for a frank unfettered interchange
      and confession of thought&mdash;they would have been mutually astonished
      to find themselves still so beloved, and each would have been dearer to
      the other than in their warmest hour of earlier attachment. But when once,
      in a very gay and occupied life, a husband and wife have admitted a
      seeming indifference to creep in between them, the chances are a thousand
      to one against its after-removal. How much more so with a wife so proud as
      Constance, and a husband so refining as Godolphin! Fortunately, however,
      as I said before, the temper of each was excellent; they never quarrelled;
      and the indifference, therefore, lay on the surface, not at the depth.
      They seemed to the world an affectionate couple, as couples go; and their
      union would have been classed by Rochefoucauld among those marriages that
      are very happy&mdash;il n'y a point de delicieux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, as Constance had predicted, the political history of the
      country was marked by a perpetual progress towards liberal opinions. Mr.
      Canning was now in office; the Catholic Question was in every one's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brilliant meeting at Erpingham House; those who composed it
      were of the heads of the party: but there were divisions amongst
      themselves; some were secretly for joining Mr. Canning's administration;
      some had openly done so; others remained in stubborn and jealous
      opposition. With these last was the heart of Constance. "Well, well, Lady
      Erpingham," said Lord Paul Plympton, a young nobleman, who had written a
      dull history, and was therefore considered likely to succeed in
      parliamentary life&mdash;"well, I cannot help thinking you are too severe
      upon Canning: he is certainly very liberal in his views."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there one law he ever caused to pass for the benefit of the working
      classes? No, Lord Paul, his Whiggism is for peers, and his Toryism for
      peasants. With the same zeal he advocates the Catholic Question and the
      Manchester Massacre."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, surely," cried Lord Paul, "you make a difference between the just
      liberality that provides for property and intelligence, and the dangerous
      liberality that would slacken the reins of an ignorant multitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Mr. Benson, a very powerful member of the Lower House, "true
      politicians must conform to circumstances. Canning may not be all we wish,
      but still he ought to be supported. I confess that I shall be generous I
      care not for office, I care not for power; but Canning is surrounded with
      enemies, who are enemies also to the people: for that reason I shall
      support him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bravo, Benson!" cried Lord Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bravo, Benson!" echoed two or three notables, who had waited an
      opportunity to declare themselves; "that's what I call handsome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disinterested, by Jove!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the Duke of Aspindale suddenly entered the room. "Ah, Lady Erpingham,
      you should have been in the Lords to-night; such a speech! Canning is
      crushed for ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speech! from whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Grey&mdash;terrific: it was the vengeance of a life concentrated
      into one hour; it has shaken the Ministry fearfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" said Benson, rising; "I shall go to Brooks's and hear more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I too," said Lord Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two after, Benson in presenting a petition, alluded in terms of
      high eulogy to the masterly speech made "in another place:" and Lord Paul
      Plympton said, "it was indeed unequalled."
    </p>
    <p>
      That's what I call handsome. Manly!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair!
    </p>
    <p>
      Disinterested, by Jove!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Canning died; his gallant soul left the field of politics broken into
      a thousand petty parties. From the time of his death the two great hosts
      into which the struggles for power were divided have never recovered their
      former strength. The demarcation that his policy had tended to efface was
      afterwards more weakened by his successor, the Duke of Wellington; and had
      it not been for the question of Reform that again drew the stragglers on
      either side around one determined banner, it is likely that Whig and Tory
      would, among the many minute sections and shades of difference, have lost
      for ever the two broad distinguishing colours of their separate factions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Canning died; and now, with redoubled energy, went on the wheels of
      political intrigue. The rapid succession of short-lived administrations,
      the leisure of a prolonged peace, the pressure of debt, the writings of
      philosophers, all, insensibly, yet quickly, excited that popular
      temperament which found its crisis in the Reform Bill.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE DEATH OF GEORGE IV.&mdash;THE POLITICAL SITUATION OF PARTIES, AND OF
      LADY ERPINGHAM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of George the Fourth was the birth of a new era. During the
      later years of that monarch a silent spirit had been gathering over the
      land, which had crept even to the very walls of his seclusion. It cannot
      be denied that the various expenses of his reign,&mdash;no longer
      consecrated by the youthful graces of the prince, no longer disguised
      beneath the military triumphs of the people,&mdash;had contributed far
      more than theoretical speculations to the desire of political change. The
      shortest road to liberty lies through attenuated pockets!
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was much at Windsor during the king's last illness, one of the
      saddest periods that ever passed within the walls of a palace. The
      memorialists of the reign of the magnificent Louis XIV. will best convey
      to the reader a notion of the last days of George the Fourth. For, like
      that great king, he was the representation in himself of a particular
      period, and he preserved much of the habits of (and much too of the
      personal interest attached to) his youth, through the dreary decline of
      age. It was melancholy to see one who had played, not only so exalted, but
      so gallant a part, breathing his life away; nor was the gloom diminished
      by the many glimpses of a fine original nature, which broke forth amidst
      infirmity and disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      George the Fourth died; his brother succeeded; and the English world began
      to breathe more freely, to look around, and to feel that the change, long
      coming, was come at last. The French Revolution, the new parliament, Henry
      Brougham's return for Yorkshire, Mr. Hurne's return for Middlesex, the
      burst of astonished indignation at the Duke of Wellington's memorable
      words against reform, all betrayed, while they ripened, the signs of the
      new age. The Whig Ministry was appointed, appointed amidst discontents in
      the city, suspicions amongst the friends of the people, amidst fires and
      insurrections in the provinces;&mdash;convulsions abroad, and turbulence
      at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of Constance in these changes was rather curious; her
      intimacy with the late king was no recommendation with the Whig government
      of his successor. Her power, as the power of fashion always must in stormy
      times, had received a shock; and as she had of late been a little divided
      from the main body of the Whigs, she did not share at once in their
      success, or claim to be one of their allies. She remained silent and
      aloof; her parties were numerous and splendid as ever, but the small
      plotting reunions of intriguers were suspended. She hinted mysteriously at
      the necessity of pausing, to see what reform the new ministers would
      recommend, and what economy they would effect. The Tories, especially the
      more moderate tribe, began to court her: the Whigs, flushed with their
      triumph, and too busy to think of women, began to neglect. This last
      circumstance the high Constance felt keenly&mdash;but with the keenness
      rather of scorn than indignation; years had deepened her secret disgust at
      all aristocratic ordinances, and looking rather at what the Whigs had been
      than what, pressed by the times, they have become, she regarded them as
      only playing with democratic counters for aristocratic rewards. She repaid
      their neglect with contempt, and the silent neutralist soon became
      regarded by them as the secret foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Constance was sufficiently the woman to feel mortified and wounded by
      that which she affected to despise. No post at court had been offered to
      her by her former friends; the confidant of George the Fourth had ceased
      to be the confidant of Lord Grey. Arrived at that doubtful time of life
      when the beauty although possessing, is no longer assured of, her charms,
      she felt the decay of her personal influence as a personal affront; and
      thus vexed, wounded, alarmed, in her mid-career, Constance was more than
      ever sensible of the peculiar disquietudes that await female ambition, and
      turned with sighs more frequent than heretofore to the recollections of
      that domestic love which seemed lost to her for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mingled with the more outward and visible stream of politics there was, as
      there ever is, a latent tide of more theoretic and speculative opinions.
      While the practical politicians were playing their momentary parts,
      schemers, and levellers, were propagating in all quarters doctrines which
      they fondly imagined were addressed to immortal ends. And Constance began
      to turn with some curiosity to these charlatans or sages. The bright
      countess listened to their harangues, pondered over their demonstrations,
      and mused over their hopes. But she had lived too much on the surface of
      the actual world, her habits of thought were too essentially worldly, to
      be converted, while she was attracted, by doctrines so startling in their
      ultimate conclusions. She turned once more to herself, and waited, in a
      sad and thoughtful stillness, the progress of things-convinced only of the
      vanity of them all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ROUE HAS BECOME A VALETUDINARIAN.&mdash;NEWS.&mdash;A FORTUNETELLER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the graced Godolphin floated down the sunny tide of his
      prosperity. He lived chiefly with a knot of epicurean dalliers with the
      time, whom he had selected from the wittiest and the easiest of the London
      world. Dictator of theatres&mdash;patron of operas&mdash;oracle in music&mdash;mirror
      of entertainments and equipage&mdash;to these conditions had his natural
      genius and his once dreaming dispositions been bowed at last! A round of
      dissipation, however, left him no time for reflection; and he believed
      (perhaps he was not altogether wrong) that the best way to preserve the
      happy equilibrium of the heart is to blunt its susceptibilities. As the
      most uneven shapes, when whirled into rapid and ceaseless motion, will
      appear a perfect circle, so, once impelled in a career that admits no
      pause, our life loses its uneven angles, and glides on in smooth and
      rounded celerity, with false aspects more symmetrical than the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Godolphin visited Saville; who now, old, worn, and fast waning to
      the grave, cropped the few flowers on the margin, and jested, but with
      sourness, on his own decay. He found the actress (who had also come to
      visit the Man of Pleasure) sitting by the window, and rattling away with
      her usual vivacity, while she divided her attention with the labours of
      knitting a purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven only knows," said Saville, "what all these times will produce. I
      lose my head in the dizzy quickness of events. Fanny, hand me my
      snuff-box. Well, I fancy my last hour is not far distant; but I hope, at
      least, I shall die a gentleman. I have a great dislike to the thought of
      being revolutionised into a roturier. That's the only kind of revolution I
      have any notion about. What do you say to all this, Godolphin? Every one
      else is turning politician; young Sunderland whirls his cab down to the
      House at four o'clock every day&mdash;dines at Bellamy's on cold beef; and
      talks of nothing but that d&mdash;&mdash;d good speech of Sir Robert's'.
      Revolution! faith, the revolution is come already. Revolutions only change
      the aspect of society, is it not changed enough within the last six
      months? Bah! I suppose you are bit by the mania?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I! while I live I will abjure the vulgar toil of ambition. Let others
      rule or ruin the state;&mdash;like the Duc de Lauzun, while the guillotine
      is preparing, I will think only of my oysters and my champagne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A noble creed!" said Fanny, smiling: "let the world go to wreck, and
      bring me my biscuit! That's Godolphin's motto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is life's motto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;a gentleman's life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pish! Fanny; no satire from you: you, who are not properly speaking even
      a tragic actress! But there is something about your profession sublimely
      picturesque in the midst of these noisy brawls. The storms of nations
      shake not the stage; you are wrapt in another life; the atmosphere of
      poetry girds you. You are like the fairies who lived among men, visible
      only at night, and playing their fantastic tricks amidst the surrounding
      passions&mdash;the sorrow, the crime, the avarice, the love, the wrath,
      the luxury, the famine, that belong to the grosser dwellers of the earth.
      You are to be envied, Fanny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so; I am growing old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old!" cried Saville: "Ah, talk not of it! Ugh!&mdash;Ugh! Curse this
      cough! But hang politics; it always brings disagreeable reflections. Glad,
      my old pupil,&mdash;glad am I to see that you still retain your august
      contempt for these foolish strugglers&mdash;insects splashing and panting
      in the vast stream of events, which they scarcely stir, and in which they
      scarcely drop before they are drowned&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or the fishes, their passions, devour them," said Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "News!" cried Saville; "let us have real news; cut all the politics out of
      the Times, Fanny, with your scissors, and then read me the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Fire in Marylebone!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not news!&mdash;skip that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Letter from Padieal.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff! What else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Emigration:&mdash;'No fewer than sixty-eight&mdash;&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold! for mercy's sake! What do I, just going out of the world, care for
      people only going out of the country? Here, child, give the paper to
      Godolphin; he knows exactly what interests a man of sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Sale of Lord Lysart's wines&mdash;&mdash;'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Capital!" cried Saville: "that's news&mdash;that's interesting!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny's pretty hands returned to their knitting. When the wines had been
      discussed, the following paragraph was chanced upon:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a foolish story going the round of the papers about Lord Grey
      and his vision;&mdash;the vision is only in the silly heads of the
      inventors of the story, and the ghost is, we suppose, the apparition of
      Old Sarum. By the way, there is a celebrated fortune-teller, or
      prophetess, now in London, making much noise. We conclude the discomfited
      Tories will next publish her oracular discourses. She is just arrived in
      time to predict the passing of the Reform Bill, without any fear of being
      proved an impostor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, by the by," said Saville, "I hear wonders of this sorceress. She
      dreams and divines with the most singular accuracy; and all the old women
      of both sexes flock to her in hackney-coaches, making fools of themselves
      to-day in order to be wise to-morrow. Have you seen her, Fanny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied the actress, very gravely; "and, in sober earnest, she has
      startled me. Her countenance is so striking, her eyes so wild, and in her
      conversation there is so much enthusiasm, that she carries you away in
      spite of yourself. Do you believe in astrology, Percy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I almost did once," said Godolphin, with a half sigh; "but does this
      female seer profess to choose astrology in preference to cards? The last
      is the more convenient way of tricking the public."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but this is no vulgar fortune-teller, I assure you," cried Fanny,
      quite eagerly: "she dwells much on magnetism; insists on the effect of
      your own imagination; discards all outward quackeries; and, in short, has
      either discovered a new way of learning the future, or revived some
      forgotten trick of deluding the public. Come and see her some day,
      Godolphin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't like that kind of imposture," said Godolphin, quickly, and
      turning away, he sank into a silent and gloomy reverie.

      CHAPTER LVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SUPERSTITION.&mdash;ITS WONDERFUL EFFECTS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was perfectly true that there had appeared in London a person of the
      female sex who, during the last few years, had been much noted on the
      Continent for the singular boldness with which she had promulgated the
      wildest doctrines, and the supposed felicity which had attended her
      vaticinations. She professed belief in all the dogmas that preceded the
      dawn of modern philosophy; and a strange, vivid, yet gloomy eloquence that
      pervaded her language gave effect to theories which, while
      incomprehensible to the many, were alluring to the few. None knew her
      native country, although she was believed to come from the North of
      Europe. Her way of life was lonely, her habits eccentric; she sought no
      companionship; she was beautiful, but not of this earth's beauty; men
      admired, but courted not; she, at least, lived apart from the reach of
      human passions. In fact, the strange Liehbur, for such was the name the
      prophetness was known by (and she assumed before it the French title of
      Madame), was not an impostor, but a fanatic: the chords of the brain were
      touched, and the sound they gave back was erring and imperfect. She was
      mad, but with a certain method in her madness; a cold, and preternatural,
      and fearful spirit abode within her, and spoke from her lips&mdash;its
      voice froze herself, and she was more awed by her own oracles than her
      listeners themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Vienna and in Paris her renown was great, and even terrible: the
      greatest men in those capitals had consulted her, and spoke of her decrees
      with a certain reverence; her insanity thrilled there, and they mistook
      the cause. Besides, in the main, she was right in the principle she
      addressed: she worked on the imagination, and the imagination afterwards
      fulfilled what she predicted. Every one knows what dark things may be done
      by our own fantastic persuasions; belief insures the miracles it credits.
      Men dream they shall die within a certain hour; the hour comes, and the
      dream is realised. The most potent wizardries are less potent than fancy
      itself. Macbeth was a murderer, not because the witches predicted, but
      because their prediction aroused the thoughts of murder. And this
      principle of action the prophetess knew well: she appealed to that
      attribute common to us all, the foolish and the wise, and on that fruitful
      ground she sowed her soothsayings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In London there are always persons to run after anything new, and Madame
      Liehbur became at once the rage.&mdash;I myself have seen a minister
      hurrying from her door with his cloak about his face; and one of the
      coldest of living sages confesses that she told him what he believes, by
      mere human means, she could not have discovered. Delusion all! But what
      age is free from it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The race of the nineteenth century boast their lights, but run as madly
      after any folly as their fathers in the eighth. What are the prophecies of
      St. Simon but a species of sorcery? Why believe the external more than the
      inner miracle?
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      There were but a few persons present at Lady Erpingham's, and when
      Radclyffe entered, Madame Liehbur was the theme of the general
      conversation. So many anecdotes were told, so much that was false was
      mingled with so much that seemed true, that Lady Erpingham's curiosity was
      excited, and she resolved to seek the modern Cassandra with the first
      opportunity. Godolphin sat apart from the talkers playing a quiet game at
      ecarte. Constance's eyes stole ever and anon to his countenance; and when
      she turned at length away with a sigh, she saw that Radclyffe's deep and
      inscrutable gaze was bent upon her, and the proud countess blushed,
      although she scarce knew why.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE EMPIRE OF TIME AND OF LOVE.&mdash;THE PROUD CONSTANCE GROWN WEARY AND
      HUMBLE.&mdash;AN ORDEAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the fine constitution of Lady Erpingham began to feel the
      effects of that life which, at once idle and busy, is the most exhausting
      of all. She suffered under no absolute illness; she was free from actual
      pain; but a fever crept over her at night, and a languid debility
      succeeded it the next day. She was melancholy and dejected; tears came
      into her eyes without a cause; a sudden noise made her tremble; her nerves
      were shaken,&mdash;terrible disease, which marks a new epoch in life,
      which is the first token that our youth is about to leave us!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is in sickness that we feel our true reliance on others, especially if
      it is of that vague and not dangerous character when those around us are
      not ashamed or roused into attendance; when the care, and the soothing,
      and the vigilance, are the result of that sympathy which true and deep
      love only feels. This thought broke upon Constance as she sat alone one
      morning in that mood when books cannot amuse, nor music lull, nor luxury
      soothe&mdash;the mood of an aching memory and a spiritless frame. Above
      her, and over the mantelpiece of her favourite room, hung that picture of
      her father which I have before described; it had been long since removed
      from Wendover Castle to London, for Constance wished it to be frequently
      in her sight. "Alas!" thought she, gazing upon the proud and animated brow
      that bent down upon her; "Alas! though in a different sphere, thy lot, my
      father, has been mine;&mdash;toil unrepaid, affection slighted, sacrifices
      forgotten;&mdash;a harder lot in part; for thou hadst, at least, in thy
      stirring and magnificent career, continued excitement and perpetual
      triumph. But I, a woman, shut out by my sex from contest, from victory, am
      left only the thankless task to devise the rewards which others are to
      enjoy; the petty plot, the poor intrigue, the toil without the honour, the
      humiliation without the revenge;&mdash;yet have I worked in thy cause, my
      father, and thou&mdash;thou, couldst thou see my heart, wouldst pity and
      approve me."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Constance turned away her eyes, they fell on the opposite mirror, which
      reflected her still lofty but dimmed and faded beauty; the worn cheek, the
      dejected eye, those lines and hollows which tell the progress of years!
      There are certain moments when the time we have been forgetting makes its
      march suddenly apparent to our own eyes; when the change we have hitherto
      marked not stares upon us rude and abrupt; we almost fancy those lines,
      these wrinkles, planted in a single hour so unperceived have they been
      before. And such a moment was this to the beautiful Constance: she started
      at her own likeness, and turned involuntarily from the unflattering
      mirror. Beside it, on her table, lay a locket, given her by Godolphin just
      before they married, and containing his hair; it was a simple trifle, and
      the simplicity seemed yet more striking amidst the costly and modern
      jewels that were scattered round it. As she looked on it, her heart, all
      woman still, flew back to the day on which, whispering eternal love, he
      hung it round her neck. "Ah, happy days! would that they could return!"
      sighed the desolate schemer; and she took the locket, kissed it, and
      softened by all the numberless recollections of the past, wept silently
      over it. "And yet," she said, after a pause, and wiping away her tears,
      "and yet this weakness is unworthy of me. Lone, sad, ill, broken in frame
      and spirit as I am, he comes not near me; I am nothing to him, nothing to
      any one in the wide world. My heart, my heart, reconcile thyself to thy
      fate!&mdash;what thou hast been from thy cradle, that shalt thou be to my
      grave. I have not even the tenderness of a child to look to&mdash;the
      future is all blank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was yet half yielding to, half struggling with, these thoughts,
      when Stainforth Radclyffe (to whom she was never denied) was suddenly
      announced. Time, which, sooner or later, repays perseverance, although in
      a deceitful coin, had brought to Radclyffe a solid earnest of future
      honors. His name had risen high in the science of his country; it was
      equally honoured by the many and the few; he had become a marked man, one
      of whom all predicted a bright hereafter. He had not yet, it is true,
      entered Parliament&mdash;usually the great arena in which English
      reputations are won&mdash;but it was simply because he had refused to
      enter it under the auspices of any patron; and his political knowledge,
      his depths of thought, and his stern, hard, ambitious mind were not the
      less appreciated and acknowledged. Between him and Constance friendship
      had continued to strengthen, and the more so as their political sentiments
      were in a great measure the same, although originating in different causes&mdash;hers
      from passion, his from reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily Constance turned aside her face, and brushed away her tears, as
      Radclyffe approached; and then seeming to busy herself amongst some papers
      that lay scattered on her escritoire, and gave her an excuse for
      concealing in part her countenance, she said, with a constrained
      cheerfulness, "I am happy you are come to relieve my ennui; I have been
      looking over letters, written so many years ago, that I have been forced
      to remember how soon I shall cease to be young; no pleasant reflection for
      any one, much less a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at a loss for a compliment in return, as you may suppose," answered
      Radclyffe; "but Lady Erpingham deserves a penance for even hinting at the
      possibility of being ever less charming than she is; so I shall hold my
      tongue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said Constance, gravely, "how little, save the mere triumphs of
      youth and beauty, is left to our sex! How much, nay, how entirely, in all
      other and loftier objects, is our ambition walled in and fettered! The
      human mind must have its aim, its aspiring; how can your sex blame us,
      then, for being frivolous when no aim, no aspiring, save those of
      frivolity, are granted us by society?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is love frivolous?" said Radclyffe; "is the empire of the heart
      nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" exclaimed Constance, with energy; "for the empire never lasts. We
      are slaves to the empire we would found; we wish to be loved, but we only
      succeed in loving too well ourselves. We lay up our all&mdash;our
      thoughts, hopes, emotions-all the treasures of our hearts&mdash;in one
      spot; and when we would retire from the deceits and cares of life, we find
      the sanctuary walled against us&mdash;we love, and are loved no longer!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance had turned round with the earnestness of the feeling she
      expressed; and her eyes, still wet with tears, her flushed cheek, her
      quivering lip, struck to Radclyffe's heart more than her words. He rose
      involuntarily; his own agitation was marked; he moved several steps
      towards Constance, and then checked the impulse, and muttered indistinctly
      to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Constance, mournfully, and scarcely heeding him&mdash;"it is in
      vain for us to be ambitious. We only deceive ourselves; we are not stern
      and harsh enough for the passion. Touch our affections, and we are
      recalled at once to the sense of our weakness; and I&mdash;I&mdash;would
      to God that I were a humble peasant girl, and not&mdash;not what I am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the lofty Constance sank down, overpowered with the bitterness
      of her feelings, and covered her face with her hands. Was Radclyffe a man
      that he could see this unmoved?&mdash;that he could hear those beautiful
      lips breathe complaints for the want of love, and not acknowledge the love
      that burned at his own heart? Long, secretly, resolutely, had he struggled
      against the passion for Constance, which his frequent intercourse with her
      had fed, and which his consciousness, that in her was the only parallel to
      himself that he had ever met with in her sex, had first led him to form;
      and now lone, neglected, sad, this haughty woman wept over her unloved lot
      in his presence, and still he was not at her feet! He spoke not, moved
      not, but his breath heaved thick, and his face was as pale as death. He
      conquered himself. All within Radclyffe obeyed the idol he had worshipped,
      even before Constance; all within him, if ardent and fiery, was also high
      and generous. The acuteness of his reason permitted him no
      self-sophistried; and he would have laid his head on the block rather than
      breathe a word of that love which he knew, from the moment it was
      confessed, would become unworthy of Constance and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Lady Erpingham, ashamed, confounded at her own
      weakness, recovered herself slowly and in silence. Radclyffe at length
      spoke; and his voice, at first trembling and indistinct, grew, as he
      proceeded, clear and earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never," said he, "shall I forget the confidence your emotions have
      testified in my&mdash;my friendship; I am about to deserve it. Do not, my
      dear friend (let me so call you), do not forget that life is too short for
      misunderstandings in which happiness is concerned. You believe that&mdash;that
      Godolphin does not repay the affection you have borne him: do not be
      angry, dear Lady Erpingham; I feel it indelicate in me to approach that
      subject, but my regard for you emboldens me. I know Godolphin's heart; he
      may seem light, neglectful, but he loves you as deeply as ever; he loves
      you entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance, humbled as she was, listened in breathless silence; her cheek
      burned with blushes, and those blushes were at once to Radclyffe a torture
      and a reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this moment," continued he, with constrained calmness, "at this moment
      he fancies in you that very coldness you lament in him. Pardon me, Lady
      Erpingham; but Godolphin's nature is wayward, mysterious, and exacting.
      Have you consulted, have you studied it sufficiently? Note it well, soothe
      it; and if his love can repay you, you will be repaid. God bless you,
      dearest Lady Erpingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment more Radclyffe had left the apartment.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      CONSTANCE MAKES A DISCOVERY THAT TOUCHES AND ENLIGHTENS HER AS TO
      GODOLPHIN'S NATURE.&mdash;AN EVENT, ALTHOUGH IN PRIVATE LIFE, NOT WITHOUT
      ITS INTEREST.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Constance most bitterly reproached herself, or rather her slackened
      nerves, her breaking health, that she had before another&mdash;that other
      too, not of her own sex&mdash;betrayed her dependence upon even her
      husband's heart for happiness; if her conscience instantly took alarm at
      the error (and it was indeed a grave one) which had revealed to any man
      her domestic griefs; yet, on the other hand, she could not control the
      wild thrill of delight with which she recalled those words that had so
      solemnly assured her she was still beloved by Godolphin. She had a firm
      respect in Radclyffe's penetration and his sincerity, and knew that he was
      one neither to deceive her nor be deceived himself. His advice, too, came
      home to her. Had she, indeed, with sufficient address, sufficient
      softness, insinuated herself into Godolphin's nature? Neglected herself,
      had she not neglected in return? She asked herself this question, and was
      never weary of examining her past conduct. That Radclyffe, the austere and
      chilling Radclyffe, entertained for her any feeling warmer than
      friendship, she never for an instant suspected; that suspicion alone would
      have driven him from her presence for ever. And although there had been a
      time, in his bright and exulting youth, when Radclyffe had not been
      without those arts which win, in the opposite sex, affection from aversion
      itself, those arts doubled, ay, a hundredfold, in their fascination, would
      not have availed him with the pure but disappointed Constance, even had a
      sense of right and wrong very different from the standard he now
      acknowledged permitted him to exert them. So that his was rather the
      sacrifice of impulse, than of any triumph that impulse could afterwards
      have gained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many, and soft and sweet were now the recollections of Constance. Her
      heart flew back to her early love among the shades of Wendover; to the
      first confession of the fair enthusiastic boy, when he offered at her
      shrine a mind, a genius, a heart capable of fruits which the indolence of
      after-life, and the lethargy of disappointed hope, had blighted before
      their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he was now so deaf to what she considered the nobler, because more
      stirring, excitements of life, was she not in some measure answerable for
      the supineness? Had there not been a day in which he had vowed to toil, to
      labour, to sacrifice the very character of his mind, for a union with her?
      Was she, after all, was she right to adhere so rigidly to her father's
      dying words, and to that vow afterwards confirmed by her own pride and
      bitterness of soul? She looked to her father's portrait for an answer; and
      that daring and eloquent face seemed, for the first time, cold and
      unanswering to her appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such meditations the hours passed, and midnight came on without
      Constance having quitted her apartment. She now summoned her woman, and
      inquired if Godolphin was at home. He had come in about an hour since,
      and, complaining of fatigue, had retired to rest. Constance again
      dismissed her maid, and stole to his apartment. He was already asleep, his
      cheek rested on his arm, and his hair fell wildly over a brow that now
      worked under the influence of his dreams. Constance put the light softly
      down, and seating herself beside him, watched over a sleep which, if it
      had come suddenly on him, was not the less unquiet and disturbed. At
      length he muttered, "Yes, Lucilla, yes; I tell you, you are avenged. I
      have not forgotten you! I have not forgotten that I betrayed, deserted
      you! but was it my fault? No, no! Yet I have not the less sought to forget
      it. These poor excesses,&mdash;these chilling gaieties,&mdash;were they
      not incurred for you?&mdash;and now you come&mdash;you&mdash;ah, no&mdash;spare
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Shocked and startled, Constance drew back. Here was a new key to
      Godolphin's present life, his dissipation, his thirst for pleasure. Had he
      indeed sought to lull the stings of conscience? And she, instead of
      soothing, of reconciling him to the past, had she left him alone to
      struggle with bitter and unresting thoughts, and to contrast the devotion
      of the one lost with the indifference of the one gained? She crept back to
      her own chamber, to commune with her heart and be still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Percy," said she, the next day, when he carelessly sauntered into
      her boudoir before he rode out, "I have a favour to ask of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who ever denied a favour to Lady Erpingham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not you, certainly; but my favour is a great one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us pass the summer in &mdash;&mdash;shire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin's brow clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Wendover Castle?" said he, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have never been there since our marriage," said Constance evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!&mdash;as you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the place," said Constance, "where you, Percy, first told me you
      loved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his wife's voice struck on the right chord in Godolphin's
      breast; he looked up, and saw her eyes full of tears and fixed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Constance," said he, much affected, "who would have thought that you
      still cherished that remembrance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! when shall I forget it?" said Constance; "then you loved me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was rejected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! but I believe now that I was wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Constance; you were wrong, for your own happiness, that the rejection
      was not renewed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Percy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Constance!" and in the accent of that last word there was something that
      encouraged Constance, and she threw herself into Godolphin's arms, and
      murmured:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I have offended, forgive me; let us be to each other what we once
      were."
    </p>
    <p>
      Words like these from the lips of one in whom such tender supplications,
      such feminine yearnings, were not common, subdued Godolphin at once. He
      folded her in his arms, and kissing her passionately, whispered, "Be
      always thus, Constance, and you will be more to me than ever."

      CHAPTER LX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE REFORM BILL.&mdash;A VERY SHORT
    </h3>
    <p>
      This reconciliation was not so short-lived as matters of the kind
      frequently are. There is a Chinese proverb which says: "How near are two
      hearts when there is no deceit between them!" And the misunderstanding of
      their mutual sentiments being removed, their affection became at once
      visible to each other. And Constance reproaching herself for her former
      pride mingled in her manner to her husband a gentle, even an humble
      sweetness, which, being exactly that which he had most desired in her, was
      what most attracted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time, Lord John Russell brought forward the Bill of Parliamentary
      Reform. Lady Erpingham was in the lantern of the House of Commons on that
      memorable night; like every one else, her feelings at first were all
      absorbed in surprise. She went home; she hastened to Godolphin's library.
      Leaning his head on his hand, that strange person, in the midst of events
      that stirred the destinies of Europe, was absorbed in the old subtleties
      of Spinosa. In the frank confidence of revived love, she put her hand upon
      his shoulder, and told him rapidly that news which was then on its way to
      terrify or delight the whole of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will this charm you, dear Constance?" said he kindly; "is it a blow to
      the party you hate, and I sympathise with&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father," interrupted Constance, passionately, "would to Heaven he had
      seen this day! It was this system, the patron and the nominee system, that
      crushed, and debased, and killed him. And now, I shall see that system
      destroyed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then, my Constance will go over to the Whigs in earnest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, because I shall meet there truth and the people!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin laughed gently at the French exaggeration of the saying, and
      Constance forgave him. The fine ladies of London were a little divided as
      to the merits of the "Bill;" Constance was the first that declared in its
      favour. She was air important ally&mdash;as important at least as a woman
      can be. A bright spirit reigned in her eye; her step grew more elastic;
      her voice more glad. This was the happiest time of her life&mdash;she was
      happy in the renewal of her love, happy in the approaching triumph of her
      hate.

    <p>
      THE SOLILOQUY OF THE SOOTHSAYER.&mdash;AN EPISODICAL MYSTERY, INTRODUCED
      AS A TYPE OF THE MANY THINGS IN LIFE THAT ARE NEVER ACCOUNTED FOR.&mdash;GRATUITOUS
      DEVIATIONS FROM OUR COMMON CAREER.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Leicester Square there is a dim old house, which I have but this
      instant visited, in order to bring back more vividly to my recollection
      the wild and unhappy being who, for some short time, inhabited its
      old-fashioned and gloomy chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that house, at the time I now speak of, lodged the mysterious Liehbur.
      It was late at noon, and she sat alone in her apartment, which was
      darkened so as to exclude the broad and peering sun. There was no trick,
      nor sign of the fallacious art she professed, visible in the large and
      melancholy room. One or two books in the German language lay on the table
      beside which she sat: but they were of the recent poetry, and not of the
      departed dogmas, of the genius of that tongue. The enthusiast was alone;
      and, with her hand supporting her chin, and her eyes fixed on vacancy, she
      seemed feeding in silence the thoughts that flitted to and fro athwart a
      brain which had for years lost its certain guide; a deserted mansion,
      whence the lord had departed, and where spirits not of this common life
      had taken up their haunted and desolate abode. And never was there a
      countenance better suited to the character which this singular woman had
      assumed. Rich, thick, auburn hair was parted loosely over a brow in which
      the large and full temples would have betrayed to a phrenologist the great
      preponderance which the dreaming and the imaginative bore over the sterner
      faculties. Her eyes were deep, intense, but of the bright and wandering
      glitter which is so powerful in its effect on the beholder, because it
      betokens that thought which is not of this daily world and inspires that
      fear, that sadness, that awe, which few have looked on the face of the
      insane and not experienced. Her features were still noble, and of the fair
      Greek symmetry of the painter's Sibyl; but the cheeks were worn and
      hollow, and one bright spot alone broke their marble paleness; her lips
      were, however, full, and yet red, and by their uncertain and varying play,
      gave frequent glimpses of teeth lustrously white; which, while completing
      the beauty of her face, aided&mdash;with somewhat of a fearful effect&mdash;the
      burning light of her strange eyes, and the vague, mystic expression of her
      abrupt and unjoyous smile. You might see when her features were, as now,
      in a momentary repose, that her health was broken, and that she was not
      long sentenced to wander over that world where the soul had already ceased
      to find its home; but the instant she spoke, her colour deepened, and the
      brilliant and rapid alternations of her countenance deceived the eye, and
      concealed the ravages of the worm that preyed within.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said she, at last breaking silence, and soliloquising in the
      English tongue, but with somewhat of a foreign accent; "yes, I am in his
      city; within a few paces of his home; I have seen him, I have heard him.
      Night after night&mdash;in rain, and in the teeth of the biting winds, I
      have wandered round his home. Ay! and I could have raised my voice, and
      shrieked a warning and a prophecy, that should have startled him from his
      sleep as the trumpet of the last angel! but I hushed the sound within my
      soul, and covered the vision with a thick silence. O God! what have I
      seen, and felt, and known, since he last saw me! But we shall meet again;
      and ere the year has rolled round, I shall feel the touch of his lips and
      die! Die! what calmness, what luxury in the word! The fiery burthen of
      this dread knowledge I have heaped upon me, shuffled off; memory no more;
      the past, the present, the future exorcised; and a long sleep, with bright
      dreams of a lulling sky, and a silver voice, and his presence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and a black girl of about ten years old, in the costume
      of her Moorish tribe, announced the arrival of a new visitor. The
      countenance of Madame Liehbur changed at once into an expression of cold
      and settled calmness; she ordered the visitor to be admitted; and
      presently, Stainforth Radclyffe entered the room.

      "Thou mistakest me and my lore," said the diviner; "I meddle not with the
      tricks and schemes of the worldly; I show the truth, not garble it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" said Radclyffe, impatiently; "this jargon cannot deceive me. You
      exhibit your skill for money. I ask one exertion of it, and desire you to
      name your reward. Let us talk after the fashion of this world, and leave
      that of the other to our dupes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, thou hast known grief too," said the diviner, musingly, "and those
      who have sorrowed ought to judge more gently of each other. Wilt thou try
      my art on thyself, ere thou askest it for others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, if you could restore the dead to my dreams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can!" replied the soothsayer, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radclyffe laughed bitterly. "Away with this talk to me; or, if you would
      convince me, raise at once the spectre I desire to see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And dost thou think, vain man," replied Liehbur, haughtily, "that I
      pretend to the power thou speakest of? Yes; but not as the impostors of
      old (dull and gross, appealing to outward spells, and spells wrought by
      themselves alone) affected to do. I can bring the dead before thee, but
      thou thyself must act upon thyself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mummery! What would you drive at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wilt thou fast three days, and for three nights abstain from sleep, and
      then visit me once again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, fair deluder; such a preliminary is too much to ask of a Neophyte.
      Three days without food, and three nights without sleep! Why, you would
      have to raise myself from the dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And canst thou," said the diviner, with great dignity, "canst thou hope
      that thou wouldst be worthy of a revelation from a higher world&mdash;that
      for thee the keys of the grave should unlock their awful treasure, and the
      dead return to life, when thou scruplest to mortify thy flesh and loosen
      the earthly bonds that cumber and chain the spirit? I tell thee, that only
      as the soul detaches itself from the frame, can its inner and purer sense
      awaken, and the full consciousness of the invisible and divine things that
      surround it descend upon its powers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what," said Radclyffe, startled more by the countenance and voice
      than the words themselves of the soothsayer; "what would you then do,
      supposing that I perform this penance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awaken to their utmost sense, even to pain and torture, the naked nerves
      of that Great Power thou callest the Imagination; that Power which
      presides over dreams and visions, which kindles song, and lives in the
      heart of Melodies; which inspired the Magian of the East and the Pythian
      voices&mdash;and, in the storms and thunder of savage lands originated the
      notion of a God and the seeds of human worship; that vast presiding Power
      which, to the things of mind, is what the Deity is to the Universe itself&mdash;the
      creator of all. I would awaken, I say, that Power from its customary sleep
      where, buried in the heart, it folds its wings, and lives but by fits and
      starts, unquiet, but unaroused; and by that Power thou wouldst see, and
      feel, and know, and through it only thou wouldst exist. So that it would
      be with thee, as if the body were not: as if thou wert already
      all-spiritual, all-living. So thou wouldst learn in life that which may be
      open to thee after death; and so, soul might now, as hereafter, converse
      with soul, and revoke the Past, and sail prescient down the dark tides of
      the Future. A brief and fleeting privilege, but dearly purchased: be wise,
      and disbelieve in it; be happy, and reject it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Radclyffe was impressed, despite himself, by the solemn novelty of this
      language, and the deep mournfulness with which the soothsayer's last
      sentence died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how," said he, after a pause, "how, and by what arts would you so
      awaken the imaginative faculty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask not until the time comes for the trial," answered Liebhur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you awaken it in all?&mdash;the dull, the unideal, as in the
      musing and exalted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! but the dull and unideal will not go through the necessary ordeal.
      Few besides those for whom fate casts her great parts in life's drama,
      ever come to that point when I can teach them the Future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that your chief votaries are among the great? Pardon me, I
      should have thought the most superstitious are to be found among the most
      ignorant and lowly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but they consult only what imposes on their credulity, without
      demanding stern and severe sacrifice of time and enjoyment, as I do. The
      daring, the resolute, the scheming with their souls intent upon great
      objects and high dreams-those are the men who despise the charms of the
      moment, who are covetous of piercing the far future, who know how much of
      their hitherward career has been brightened, not by genius or nature, but
      some strange confluence of events, some mysterious agency of fate. The
      great are always fortunate, and therefore mostly seekers into the decrees
      of fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      So great is the influence which enthusiasm, right or wrong, always
      exercises over us, that even the hard and acute Radclyffe-who had entered
      the room with the most profound contempt for the pretensions of the
      soothsayer, and partly from a wish to find materials for ridiculing a
      folly of the day, partly, it may be from the desire to examine which
      belonged to his nature&mdash;began to consider in his own mind whether he
      should yield to his curiosity, now strongly excited, and pledge himself to
      the preliminary penance the diviner had ordained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soothsayer continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The stars, and the clime, and the changing moon have power over us&mdash;why
      not? Do they not have influence over the rest of nature? But we can only
      unravel their more august and hidden secrets, by giving full wing to the
      creative spirit which first taught us their elementary nature, and which,
      when released from earth, will have full range to wander over their
      brilliant fields. Know in one word, the Imagination and the Soul are one,
      one indivisible and the same; on that truth rests all my lore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I followed your precepts, what other preliminaries would you
      enjoin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until thou engagest to perform them, will I tell thee more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I engage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And swear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear!"
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IN WHICH THE COMMON LIFE GLIDES INTO THE STRANGE.&mdash;EQUALLY TRUE, BUT
      THE TRUTH NOT EQUALLY ACKNOWLEDGED.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the night of this interview that Constance, coming into
      Godolphin's room, found him leaning against the wall, pale, and agitated,
      and almost insensible. "Percy&mdash;Percy, you are ill!" she exclaimed,
      and wound her arms round his neck. He looked at her long and wistfully,
      breathing hard all the time, until at length he seemed slowly to recover
      his self-possession, and seating himself, motioned Constance to do the
      same. After a pause, he said, clasping her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, Constance. My health, I fear, is breaking; I am tormented
      by fearful visions; I am possessed by some magic influence. For several
      nights successively, before falling asleep, a cold tremor has gradually
      pervaded my frame; the roots of my hair stand on end; my teeth chatter; a
      vague horror seizes me; my blood seems turned to a solid substance, so
      curdled and stagnant is it. I strive to speak, to cry out, but my voice
      clings to the roof of my mouth; I feel that I have no longer power over
      myself. Suddenly, and in the very midst of this agony, I fall into a heavy
      sleep; then come strange bewildering dreams, with Volktman's daughter for
      ever presiding over them; but with a changed countenance, calm,
      unutterably calm, and gazing on me with eyes that burn into my soul. The
      dream fades, I wake with the morning, but exhausted and enfeebled. I have
      consulted physicians; I have taken drugs; but I cannot break the spell&mdash;the
      previous horror and the after-dreams. And just now, Constance, just now&mdash;you
      see the window is open to the park, the gate of the garden is unclosed; I
      happened to lift my eyes, and lo! gazing upon me in the sickly moonlight,
      was the countenance of my dreams&mdash;Lucilla's, but how altered!
      Merciful Heaven! is it a mockery, or can the living Lucilla really be in
      England? and have these visions, these terrors been part of that
      mysterious sympathy which united us ever, and which her father predicted
      should cease but with our lives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The emotions of Godolphin were so rarely visible, and in the present
      instance they were so unaffected, and so roused, that Constance could not
      summon courage to soothe, to cheer him; she herself was alarmed and
      shocked, and glanced fearfully towards the window, lest the apparition he
      had spoken of should reappear. All without was still, not a leaf stirred
      on the trees in the Mall; no human figure was to be seen. She turned again
      to Godolphin, and kissed the drops from his brow, and pressed his cheek to
      her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a presentiment," said he, "that something dreadful will happen
      shortly. I feel as if I were near some great crisis of my life; and as if
      I were about to step from the bright and palpable world into regions of
      cloud and dark ness. Constance, strange misgivings as to my choice in my
      past life haunt and perplex me. I have sought only the present; I have
      adjured all toil, all ambition, and laughed at the future; my hand has
      plucked the rose-leaves, and now they lie withered in the grasp. My youth
      flies me&mdash;age scowls on me from the distance; an age of frivolities
      that I once scorned; yet&mdash;yet, had I formed a different creed, how
      much I might have done! But&mdash;but, out on this cant! My nerves are
      shattered, and I prate nonsense. Lend me your arm, Constance, let us go
      into the saloon, and send for music!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And all that night Constance watched by the side of Godolphin, and marked
      in mute terror the convulsions that wrung his sleep, the foam that
      gathered to his lip, the cries that broke from his tongue. But she was
      rewarded when, with the grey dawn, he awoke, and, catching her tender and
      tearful gaze, flung himself upon her bosom, and bade God bless her for her
      love!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A MEETING BETWEEN CONSTANCE AND THE PROPHETESS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A strange suspicion had entered Constance's mind, and for Godolphin's sake
      she resolved to put it to the proof. She drew her mantle round her stately
      figure, put on a large disguising bonnet, and repaired to Madame Liehbur's
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moorish girl opened the door to the countess; and her strange dress,
      her African hue and features, relieved by the long, glittering pendants in
      her ears, while they seemed suited to the eccentric reputation of her
      mistress, brought a slight smile to the proud lip of Lady Erpingham, as
      she conceived them a part of the charlatanism practised by the soothsayer.
      The girl only replied to Lady Erpingham's question by an intelligent sign;
      and running lightly up the stairs, conducted the guest into an anteroom,
      where she waited but for a few moments before she was admitted into Madame
      Liehbur's apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect that the personal beauty of the diviner always produced on
      those who beheld her was not less powerful than usual on the surprised and
      admiring gaze of Lady Erpingham. She bowed her haughty brow with
      involuntary respect, and took the seat to which the enthusiast beckoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what, lady," said the soothsayer, in the foreign music of her low
      voice, "what brings thee hither? Wouldst thou gain, or hast thou lost,
      that gift our poor sex prizes so dearly beyond its value? Is it of love
      that thou wouldst speak to the interpreter of dreams and the priestess of
      the things to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      While the bright-eyed Liehbur thus spoke, the countess examined through
      her veil the fair face before her, comparing it with that description
      which Godolphin had given her of the sculptor's daughter, and her
      suspicion acquired new strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seek not that which you allude to," said Constance; "but of the future,
      although without any definite object, I would indeed like to question you.
      All of us love to pry into dark recesses hid from our view, and over which
      you profess the empire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your voice is sweet, but commanding," said the oracle; "and your air is
      stately, as of one born in courts. Lift your veil, that I may gaze upon
      your face, and tell by its lines the fate your character has shaped for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" answered Constance, "life betrays few of its past signs by outward
      token. If you have no wiser art than that drawn from the lines and
      features of our countenances, I shall still remain what I am now&mdash;an
      unbeliever in your powers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The brow, and the lip, and the eye, and the expression of each and all,"
      answered Liehbur, "are not the lying index you suppose them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," rejoined Constance, "by those signs will I read your own destiny,
      as you would read mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sibyl started, and waved her hand impatiently; but Constance
      proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your birth, despite your fair locks, was under a southern sky; you were
      nursed in the delusions you now teach; you were loved, and left alone; you
      are in the country of your lover. Is it not so?&mdash;am I not an oracle
      in my turn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The mysterious Liehbur fell back in her chair; her lips apart and blanched&mdash;her
      hands clasped&mdash;her eyes fixed upon her visitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?" she cried at last, in a shrill tone; "who, of my own sex,
      knows my wretched history? Speak, speak!&mdash;in mercy speak! tell me
      more! convince me that you have but vainly guessed my secret, or that you
      have a right to know it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did not your father forsake, for the blue skies of Rome, his own colder
      shores?" continued Constance, adopting the heightened and romantic tone of
      the one she addressed; and, "Percy Godolphin&mdash;is that name still
      familiar to the ear of Lucilla Volktman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud, long shriek burst from the lips of the soothsayer, and she sank at
      once lifeless on the ground. Greatly alarmed, and repenting her own
      abruptness, Constance hastened to her assistance. She lifted the poor
      being, whom she unconsciously had once contributed so deeply to injure,
      from the ground; she loosened her dress, and perceived that around her
      neck hung a broad ivory necklace wrought with curious characters, and many
      uncouth forms and symbols. This evidence that, in deluding others, the
      soothsayer deluded herself also, touched and affected the countess; and
      while she was still busy in chafing the temples of Lucilla, the Moor,
      brought to the spot by that sudden shriek, entered the apartment. She
      seemed surprised and terrified at her mistress's condition, and poured
      forth, in some tongue unknown to Constance, what seemed to her a volley of
      mingled reproach and lamentation. She seized Lady Erpingham's hand, dashed
      it indignantly away, and, supporting herself the ashen cheek of Lucilla,
      motioned to Lady Erpingham to depart; but Constance, not easily accustomed
      to obey, retained her position beside the still insensible Lucilla; and
      now, by slow degrees, and with quick and heavy sighs, the unfortunate
      daughter of Volktman returned to life and consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In assisting Lucilla, the countess had thrown aside her veil, and the eyes
      of the soothsayer opened upon that superb beauty, which once to see was
      never to forget. Involuntarily she again closed her eyes, and groaned
      audibly; and then, summoning all her courage, she withdrew her hand from
      Constance's clasp, and bade her Moorish handmaid leave them once more
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, then," said Lucilla, after a pause, "it is Percy Godolphin's wife;
      his English wife, who has come to gaze on the fallen, the degraded
      Lucilla; and yet," sinking her voice into a tone of ineffable and
      plaintive sweetness&mdash;"yet I have slept on his bosom, and been dear
      and sacred to him as thou! Go, proud lady, go!&mdash;leave me to my mad,
      and sunken, and solitary state. Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Lucilla!" said Constance, kindly, and striving once more to take her
      hand, "do not cast me away from you. I have long sympathised with your
      generous although erring heart&mdash;your bard and bitter misfortunes.
      Look on me only as your friend&mdash;nay, your sister, if you will. Let me
      persuade you to leave this strange and desultory life; choose your own
      home: I am rich to overflowing; all you can desire shall be at your
      command. He shall not know more of you unless (to assuage the remorse that
      the memory of you does, I know, still occasion him) you will suffer him to
      learn, from your own hand, that you are well and at ease, and that you do
      not revoke your former pardon. Come, dear Lucilla!" and the arm of the
      generous and bright-souled Constance gently wound round the feeble frame
      of Lucilla, who now, reclining back, wept as if her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, give me the deep, the grateful joy of thinking I can minister to
      your future comforts. I was the cause of all your wretchedness; but for
      me, Godolphin would have been yours for ever&mdash;would probably, by
      marriage, have redressed your wrongs; but for me you would not have
      wandered an outcast over the inhospitable world. Let me in something
      repair what I have cost you. Speak to me, Lucilla!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I will speak to you," said poor Lucilla, throwing herself on the
      ground, and clasping with grateful warmth the knees of her gentle soother;
      "for long, long years&mdash;I dare not think how many&mdash;I have not
      heard the voice of kindness fall upon my ear. Among strange faces and
      harsh tongues hath my lot been cast; and if I have wrought out from the
      dreams of my young hours the course of this life (which you contemn, but
      not justly), it has been that I may stand alone and not dependent; feared
      and not despised. And now you, you whom I admire and envy, and would
      reverence more than living woman (for he loves you and deems you worthy of
      him), you, lady, speak to me as a sister would speak, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
      Here sobs interrupted Lucilla's speech; and Constance herself, almost
      equally affected, and finding it vain to attempt to raise her, knelt by
      her side, and tenderly caressing her, sought to comfort her, even while
      she wept in doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was a beautiful passage in the life of the lofty Constance. Never
      did she seem more noble than when, thus lowly and humbling herself, she
      knelt beside the poor victim of her husband's love, and whispered to the
      diseased and withering heart tidings of comfort, charity, home, and a
      futurity of honour and of peace. But this was not a dream that could long
      lull the perturbed and erring brain of Lucilla Volktman. And when she
      recovered, in some measure, her self-possession, she rose, and throwing
      back the wild hair from her throbbing temples, she said, in a calm and
      mournful voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your kindness comes too late. I am dying, fast&mdash;fast. All that is
      left to me in the world are these very visions, this very power&mdash;call
      it delusion if you will&mdash;from which you would tear me. Nay, look not
      so reproachfully, and in such wonder. Do you not know that men have in
      poverty, sickness, and all outer despair, clung to a creative spirit
      within&mdash;a world peopled with delusions&mdash;and called it Poetry?
      and that gift has been more precious to them than all that wealth and pomp
      could bestow? So," continued Lucilla, with fervid and insane enthusiasm,
      "so is this, my creative spirit, my imaginary world, my inspiration, what
      poetry may be to others. I may be mistaken in the truth of my belief.
      There are times when my brain is cool, and my frame at rest, and I sit
      alone and think over the real past&mdash;when I feel my trust shaken, and
      my ardour damped: but that thought does not console but torture me, and I
      hasten to plunge once more among the charms, and spells, and mighty
      dreams, that wrap me from my living self. Oh, lady! bright, and beautiful,
      and lofty, as you are, there may come a time when you can conceive that
      even madness may be a relief. For" (and here the wandering light burned
      brighter in the enthusiast's glowing eyes), "for, when the night is round
      us, and there is peace on earth, and the world's children sleep, it is a
      wild joy to sit alone and vigilant, and forget that we live and are
      wretched. The stars speak to us then with a wondrous and stirring voice;
      they tell us of the doom of men and the wreck of empires, and prophesy of
      the far events which they taught to the old Chaldeans. And then the Winds,
      walking to and fro as they list, bid us go forth with them and hear the
      songs of the midnight spirits; for you know," she whispered with a smile,
      putting her hand upon the arm of the appalled and shrinking Constance, who
      now saw how hopeless was the ministry she had undertaken, "though this
      world is given up to two tribes of things that live and have a soul: the
      one bodily and palpable as we are; the other more glorious, but invisible
      to our dull sight&mdash;though I have seen them&mdash;Dread Solemn
      Shadows, even in their mirth; the night is their season as the day is
      ours; they march in the moonbeams, and are borne upon the wings of the
      winds. And with them, and by their thoughts, I raise myself from what I am
      and have been. Ah, lady, wouldst thou take this comfort from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Constance, gathering courage from the gentleness which
      Lucilla's insanity now wore, and trying to soothe, not contradict her in
      her present vein, "but in the country, Lucilla, in some quiet and
      sheltered nook, you might indulge these visions without the cares and
      uncertainty that must now perplex you; without leading this dangerous and
      roving life, which must at times expose you to insult, to annoyance, and
      discontent you with, yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken, lady," said the astrologer, proudly; "none know me who
      do not fear. I am powerful, and I hug my power&mdash;it comforts me:
      without it, what should I be?&mdash;an abject, forsaken, miserable woman.
      No! that power I possess&mdash;to shake men's secret souls&mdash;even if
      it be a deceit&mdash;even if I should laugh at them, not pity&mdash;reconciles
      me to myself and to the past. And I am not poor, madam," as, with the
      common caprice of her infirmity, an angry suspicion seemed to cross her;
      "I want no one's charity, I have learned to maintain myself. Nay, I could
      be even wealthy if I would!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," said Constance, seeing that for the present she must postpone her
      benevolent intentions, "and he&mdash;Godolphin&mdash;you forgive him
      still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that name, it was as if a sudden charm had been whispered to the
      fevered heart of the poor fanatic; her head sank from its proud bearing; a
      deep, a soft blush coloured the wan cheek; her arms drooped beside her;
      she trembled violently; and, after a moment's silence, sank again on her
      seat and covered her face with her hands. "Ah!" said she, softly, "that
      word brings me back to my young days, when I asked no power but what love
      gave me over one heart: it brings me back to the blue Italian lake, and
      the waving pines, and our solitary home, and my babe's distant grave. Tell
      me," she cried, again starting up, "has he not spoken of me lately&mdash;has
      he not seen me in his dreams? have I not been present to his soul when the
      frame, torpid and locked, severed us no more, and, in the still hours, I
      charmed myself to his gaze? Tell me, has he not owned that Lucilla haunted
      his pillow? Tell me; and if I err, my spells are nothing, my power is
      vanity, and I am the helpless creature thou wouldst believe me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite her reason and her firm sense, Constance half shuddered at these
      mysterious words, as she recalled what Percy had told her of his dreams
      the preceding evening, and the emotions she herself had witnessed in his
      slumbers when she watched beside his bed. She remained silent, and Lucilla
      regarded her countenance with a sort of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My art, then, is not so idle as thou wouldst hold it. But&mdash;hush!&mdash;last
      night I beheld him, not in spirit, but visibly, face to face: for I wander
      at times before his home (his home was once mine!) and he saw me, and was
      smitten with fear; in these worn features he could recognise not the
      living Lucilla he had known. But go to him!&mdash;thou, his wife, his own&mdash;go
      to him; tell him&mdash;no, tell him not of me. He must not seek me; we
      must not held parley together: for oh, lady" (and Lucilla's face became
      settled into an expression so sad, so unearthly sad, that no word can
      paint, no heart conceive, its utter and solemn sorrow), "when we two meet
      again to commune,&mdash;to converse,&mdash;when once more I touch that
      band, when once more I feel that beloved, that balmy breath;&mdash;my last
      hour is at hand&mdash;and danger&mdash;imminent, dark, and deadly danger,
      clings fast to him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Lucilla closed her eyes, as it to shut some horrid vision
      from her gaze; and Constance looked fearfully round, almost expecting some
      apparition at hand. Presently Lucilla, moving silently across the room,
      beckoned to the countess to follow: she did so: they entered another
      apartment: before a recess there hung a black curtain: Lucilla drew it
      slowly aside, and Constance turned her eyes from a dazzling light that
      broke upon them; when she again looked, she beheld a sort of glass dial
      marked with various quaint hieroglyphics and the figures of angels,
      beautifully wrought; but around the dial, which was circular, were ranged
      many stars, and the planets, set in due order. These were lighted from
      within by some chemical process, and burnt with a clear and lustrous, but
      silver light. And Constance observed that the dial turned round, and that
      the stars turned with it, each in a separate motion; and in the midst of
      the dial were the bands as of a clock-that moved, but so slowly, that the
      most patient gaze alone could observe the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the wondering Constance regarded this singular device, Lucilla
      pointed to one star that burned brighter than the rest; and below it,
      half-way down the dial, was another, a faint and sickly orb, that, when
      watched, seemed to perform a much more rapid and irregular course than its
      fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bright star is his," said she; "and yon dim and dying one is the type
      of mine. Note: in the course they both pursue they must meet at last; and
      when they meet, the mechanism of the whole halts&mdash;the work of the
      dial is for ever done. These hands indicate hourly the progress made to
      that end; for it is the mimicry and symbol of mine. Thus do I number the
      days of my fate; thus do I know, even almost to a second, the period in
      which I shall join my Father that is in Heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," continued the maniac (though maniac is too harsh and decided a
      word for the dreaming wildness of Lucilla's insanity), as, dropping the
      curtain, she took her guest's hand and conducted her back into the outer
      room&mdash;"and now, farewell! You sought me, and, I feel, only from kind
      and generous motives. We never shall meet more. Tell not your husband that
      you have seen me. He will know soon, too soon, of my existence: fain would
      I spare him that pang and," growing pale as she spoke, "that peril; but
      Fate forbids it. What is writ, is writ: and who shall blot God's sentence
      from the stars, which are His book? Farewell! high thoughts are graved
      upon your brow may they bless you; or, where they fail to bless, may they
      console and support. Farewell! I have not yet forgotten to be grateful,
      and I still dare to pray."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, Lucilla kissed the hand she had held, and turning hastily
      away, regained the room she had just left; and, locking the door, left the
      stunned and bewildered countess to depart from the melancholy abode. With
      faltering steps she quitted the chamber, and at the foot of the stairs the
      little Moor awaited her. To her excited fancy there was something eltrich
      and preternatural in the gaze of the young African, and the grin of her
      pearly teeth, as she opened the door to the visitant. Hastening to her
      carriage, which she had left at a corner of the square, the countess
      rejoiced when she gained it; and throwing herself back on the luxurious
      cushions, felt as exhausted by this starry and weird incident in the epic
      of life's common career, as if she had partaken of that overpowering
      inspiration which she now almost incredulously asked herself, as she
      looked forth on the broad day and the busy streets, if she had really
      witnessed.

      CHAPTER LXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LUCILLA'S FLIGHT.&mdash;THE PERPLEXITY OF LADY ERPINGHAM.&mdash;A CHANGE
      COMES OVER GODOLPHIN'S MIND.&mdash;HIS CONVERSATION WITH RADCLYFFE.&mdash;GENERAL
      ELECTION.&mdash;GODOLPHIN BECOMES A SENATOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      No human heart ever beat with more pure and generous emotions, when freed
      from the political fever that burned within her (withering, for the
      moment, the chastened and wholesome impulses of her nature), than those
      which animated the heart of the queenly Constance. She sent that evening
      for the most celebrated physician in London&mdash;that polished and
      courtly man who seems born for the maladies of the drawing-room, but who
      beneath so urbane a demeanour, conceals so accurate and profound a
      knowledge of the disorders of his unfortunate race. I say accurate and
      profound comparatively, for positive knowledge of pathology is what no
      physician in modern times and civilized countries really possesses. No man
      cures us&mdash;the highest art is not to kill! Constance, then, sent for
      this physician, and, as delicately as possible, related the unfortunate
      state of Lucilla, and the deep anxiety she felt for her mental and bodily
      relief. The physician promised to call the next day; he did so, late in
      the afternoon&mdash;Lucilla was gone. Strange, self-willed, mysterious,
      she came like a dream, to warn, to terrify, and to depart. They knew not
      whither she had fled, and her Moorish handmaid alone attended her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance was deeply chagrined at this intelligence; for she had already
      begun to build castles in the air, which poor Lucilla, with a frame
      restored, and a heart at ease, and nothing left of the past but a soft and
      holy penitence, should inhabit. The countess, however, consoled herself
      with the hope that Lucilla would at least write to her, and mention her
      new place of residence; but days passed and no letter came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance felt that her benevolent intentions were doomed to be
      unfulfilled. She was now greatly perplexed whether or not to relate to
      Godolphin the interview that had taken place between her and Lucilla. She
      knew the deep, morbid, and painful interest which the memory of this wild
      and visionary creature created in Godolphin; and she trembled at the
      feeling she might re-awaken by even a faint picture of the condition and
      mental infirmities of her whose life he had so darkly shadowed. She
      resolved, therefore, at all events for the present, and until every hope
      of discovering Lucilla once more had expired, to conceal the meeting that
      had occurred. And in this resolve she was strengthened by perceiving that
      Godolphin's mind had become gradually calmed from its late excitement, and
      that he had begun to consider, or at least appeared to consider the
      apparition of Lucilla at his window, as the mere delusion of a heated
      imagination. His nights grew once more tranquil, and freed from the dark
      dreams that had tormented his brain; and even the cool and unimaginative
      Constance could scarcely divest herself of the wild fancy that, when
      Lucilla was near, a secret and preternatural sympathy between Godolphin
      and the reader of the stars had produced that influence over his nightly
      dreams which paled, and receded, and vanished, as Lucilla departed from
      the actual circle in which he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this time, too, that a change was perceptible in Godolphin's
      habits, and crept gradually over the character of his thoughts.
      Dissipation ceased to allure him, the light wit of his parasites palled
      upon his ear; magnificence had lost its gloss, and the same fastidious,
      exacting thirst for the ideal which had disappointed him in the better
      objects of life, began now to discontent him with its glittering
      pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The change was natural and the causes not difficult to fathom. The fact
      was, that Godolphin had now arrived at that period of existence when a
      man's character is almost invariably subject to great change; the crisis
      in life's fever, when there is a new turn in our fate, and our moral death
      or regeneration is sealed by the silent wavering, or the solemn decision
      of the Hour. Arrived at the confines of middle age, there is an outward
      innovation in the whole system; unlooked-for symptoms break forth in the
      bodily, unlooked-for symptoms in the mental, frame. It happened to
      Godolphin that, at this critical period, a chance, a circumstance, a
      straw, had reunited his long interrupted, but never stifled affections to
      the image of his beautiful Constance. The reign of passion, the magic of
      those sweet illusions, that ineffable yearning which possession mocks,
      although it quells at last, were indeed for ever over; but a friendship
      more soft and genial than exists in any relation, save that of husband and
      wife, had sprung up, almost as by a miracle (so sudden was it), between
      breasts for years divided. And the experience of those years had taught
      Godolphin how frail and unsubstantial had been all the other ties he had
      formed. He wondered, as sitting alone with Constance, her tenderness
      recalled the past, her wit enlivened the present, and his imagination
      still shed a glory and a loveliness over the future, that he had been so
      long insensible to the blessing of that communion which he now
      experienced. He did not perceive what in fact was the case&mdash;that the
      tastes and sympathies of each, blunted by that disappointment which is the
      child of experience, were more willing to concede somewhat to the tastes
      and sympathies of the other; that Constance gave a more indulgent
      listening to his beautiful refinements of an ideal and false epicurism;
      that he, smiling still, smiled with kindness, not with scorn, at the
      sanguine politics, the worldly schemes, and the rankling memories of the
      intriguing Constance. Fortunately, too, for her, the times were such, that
      men who never before dreamed of political interference were roused and
      urged into the mighty conflux of battling interests, which left few
      moderate and none neuter. Every coterie resounded with political
      war-cries; every dinner rang; from soup to the coffee, with the merits of
      the bill; wherever Godolphin turned for refuge, Reform still assailed him;
      and by degrees the universal feeling, that was at first ridiculed, was at
      last, although reluctantly, admitted by his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said he, one clay, musingly, to Radclyffe, whom he met in the old
      Green Park,&mdash;(for since the conversation recorded between Radclyffe
      and Constance the former came little to Erpingham House), "why should I
      not try a yet untried experiment? Why should I not live like others in
      their graver as in their lighter pursuits? I confess, when I look back to
      the years I have spent in England, I feel that I calculated erroneously. I
      chalked out a plan&mdash;I have followed it rigidly. I have lived for
      self, for pleasure, for luxury; I have summoned wit, beauty, even wisdom
      around me. I have been the creator of a magic circle, but to the magician
      himself the magic was tame and ignoble. In short, I have dreamed, and am
      awake. Yet, what course of life should supply this, which I think of
      deserting? Shall I go once more abroad, and penetrate some untravelled
      corner of the earth? Shall I retire into the country, and write, draining
      my mind of the excitement that presses on it; or lastly, shall I plunge
      with my contemporaries into the great gulf of actual events, and strive,
      and fret, and struggle?&mdash;or&mdash;in short, Radclyffe, you are a wise
      man: advise me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" answered Radclyffe, "it is of no use advising one to be happy who
      has no object beyond himself. Either enthusiasm, or utter mechanical
      coldness, is necessary to reconcile men to the cares and mortifications of
      life. You must feel nothing, or you must feel for others. Unite yourself
      to a great object; see its goal distinctly; cling to its course
      courageously; hope for its triumph sanguinely; and on its majestic
      progress you sail, as in a ship, agitated indeed by the storms, but
      unheeding the breeze and the surge that would appal the individual effort.
      The larger public objects make us glide smoothly and unfelt over our minor
      private griefs. To be happy, my dear Godolphin, you must forget yourself.
      Your refining and poetical temperament preys upon your content. Learn
      benevolence&mdash;it is the only cure to a morbid nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin was greatly struck by this answer of Radclyffe; the more so, as
      he had a deep faith in the unaffected sincerity and the calculating wisdom
      of his adviser. He looked hard in Radclyffe's face, and, after a pause of
      some moments, replied slowly, "I believe you are right after all; and I
      have learned in a few short sentences the secret of a discontented life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin would have sought other opportunities of conversing with
      Radclyffe, but events soon parted them. Parliament was dissolved! What an
      historical event is recorded in those words! The moment the king consented
      to that measure, the whole series of subsequent events became, to an
      ordinary prescience, clear as in a mirror. Parliament dissolved in the
      heat of the popular enthusiasm, a majority, a great majority of Reformers
      was sure to be returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance perceived at a glance the whole train of consequences issuing
      from that one event; perceived and exulted. A glory had gone for ever from
      the party she abhorred. Her father was already avenged. She heard his
      scornful laugh ring forth from the depths of his forgotten grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      London emptied itself at once. England was one election. Godolphin
      remained almost alone. For the first time a sense of littleness crept over
      him; a feeling of insignificance, which wounded and galled his vain
      nature. In these beat struggles he was nothing. The admired&mdash;the
      cultivated&mdash;spirituel&mdash;the splendid Godolphin, sank below the
      commonest adventurer, the coarsest brawler&mdash;yea, the humblest
      freeman, who felt his stake in the state, joined the canvass, swelled the
      cry, and helped in the mighty battle between old things and new, which was
      so resolutely begun. This feeling gave an impetus to the growth of the new
      aspirations he had already suffered his mind to generate; and Constance
      marked, with vivid delight, that he now listened to her plans with
      interest, and examined the political field with a curious and searching
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was soon condemned to a disappointment proportioned to her
      delight. Though Godolphin had hitherto taken no interest in party
      politics, his prejudices, his feelings, his habits of mind, were all the
      reverse of democratic. When he once began to examine the bearings of the
      momentous question that agitated England, he was not slow in coming to
      conclusions which threatened to produce a permanent disagreement between
      Constance and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish me to enter Parliament, my dear Constance," said he, with his
      quiet smile; "it would be an experiment dangerous to the union
      re-established between us. I should vote against your Bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" exclaimed Constance, with warmth; "is it possible that you can
      sympathise with the fears of a selfish oligarchy&mdash;with the cause of
      the merchants and traffickers of the plainest right of a free people&mdash;the
      right to select their representatives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Constance," returned Godolphin, "my whole theory of Government is
      aristocratic. The right of the people to choose representatives!&mdash;you
      may as well say the right of the people to choose kings, or magistrates,
      and judges&mdash;or clergymen and archbishops! The people have, it is
      true, the abstract and original right to choose all these, and every year
      to chop and change them as they please, but the people, very properly, in
      all states, mortgage their elementary rights for one catholic and
      practical right&mdash;the right to be well governed. It may be no more to
      the advantage of the state that the People (that is, the majority, the
      populace) should elect uncontrolled all the members of the House of
      Commons&mdash;than that they should elect all the pastors of their
      religion. The sole thing we have to consider is, will they be better
      governed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unquestionably," said Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unquestionably!&mdash;Well, I question it. I foresee a more even balance
      of parties&mdash;nothing else. When parties are evenly balanced states
      tremble. In good government there should be somewhere sufficient power to
      carry on, not unexamined, but at least with vigour, the different
      operations of government itself. In free countries, therefore, one party
      ought to preponderate sufficiently over the other. If it do not&mdash;all
      the state measures are crippled, delayed, distorted, and the state
      languishes while the doctors dispute as to the medicines to be applied to
      it. You will find by your Bill, not that the Tories are destroyed, but
      that the Whigs and the Radicals are strengthened&mdash;the Lords are not
      crushed&mdash;but the Commons are in a state to contest with them. Hence
      party battles upon catchwords&mdash;struggles between the two chambers for
      things of straw. You who desire progress and movement will find the real
      affairs of this great Artificial Empire, in its trade&mdash;commerce&mdash;colonies&mdash;internal
      legislation&mdash;standing still while the Whigs and the Tories pelt each
      other with the quibbles of faction. No I should vote against your Bill! I
      am not for popular governments, though I like free states. All the
      advantages of democracy seem to me more than counterbalanced by the
      sacrifice of the peace and tranquillity, the comfort and the grace, the
      dignity and the charities of life that democracies usually entail. If the
      object of men is to live happily&mdash;not to strive and to fret&mdash;not
      to make money in the marketplace, and call each other rogues on the
      hustings, who would not rather be a German than an American? I own I
      regret to differ from you. For&mdash;but no matter&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For!&mdash;what were you about to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For&mdash;then, since you must know it&mdash;I am beginning to feel
      interest in these questions&mdash;excitement is contagious. And after all,
      if a man really deem his mother-country in some danger, inaction is not
      philosophy, but a species of parricide. But to think of the daily and
      hourly pain I should occasion to you, my beloved and ardent Constance, by
      shocking all your opinions, counteracting all your schemes, working
      against objects which your father's fate and your early associations have
      so singularly made duties in your eyes-to do all this is a patriotism
      beyond me. Let us glide out of this whirlpool, and hoist sail for some
      nook in the country where we can hear gentler sounds than the roar of the
      democracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Constance sighed, and suffered Godolphin to quit her in silence. But her
      generous heart was touched by his own generosity. This is one of the great
      curses of a woman who aspires to the man's part of political controversy.
      If the man choose to act, the woman, with all her wiles, her intrigues,
      her arts, is powerless. If Godolphin were to enter Parliament a Tory, the
      great Whig rendezvous of Erpingham House was lost, and Constance herself a
      cipher&mdash;and her father's wrongs forgotten, and the stern purpose of
      her masculine career baffled at the very moment of success. She now
      repented that she had ever desired to draw Godolphin's attention to
      political matters. She wondered at her own want of foresight. How, with
      his love for antiquity&mdash;his predilections for the elegant and the
      serene&mdash;his philosophy of the "Rose-garden"&mdash;could she ever have
      supposed that he would side with the bold objects and turbulent will of a
      popular party in a stormy crisis?
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was not renewed. But she had the pain of observing that
      Godolphin's manner was altered: he took pleasure in none of his old
      hobbies&mdash;he was evidently dissatisfied with himself. In fact, it is
      true that he, for the first time in his life, felt that there is a remorse
      to the mind as well as to the soul, and that a man of genius cannot be
      perpetually idle without, as he touches on the middle of his career,
      looking to the past with some shame, and to the fixture with some
      ambition. One evening, when he had sat by the open window in a thoughtful
      and melancholy, almost morose, silence for a considerable time, Constance,
      after a violent struggle with herself, rose suddenly, and fell on his neck&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, Percy," she said, unable to suppress her tears&mdash;"forgive
      me&mdash;it is past&mdash;I have no right that you, so superior to myself,
      should be sacrificed to my&mdash;my prejudices you would call them&mdash;so
      be it. Is it for your wife to condemn you to be inglorious? No&mdash;no&mdash;dear
      Godolphin&mdash;fulfil your destiny&mdash;you are born for high objects.
      Be active&mdash;be distinguished&mdash;and I will ask no more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      John Vernon, in that hour you were forgotten! Who among the dead can ever
      hope for fidelity, when love to the living invites a woman to betray?
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sweet Constance," said Godolphin, drawing her to his heart, and
      affected in proportion as he appreciated all that in that speech his wife
      gave up for his sake&mdash;the all, far more than the lovely person, the
      splendid wealth, the lofty rank that she had brought to his home&mdash;"my
      sweet Constance, do not think I will take advantage of words so
      generously, but hastily spoken. Time enough hereafter to think of
      differences between us. At present let us indulge only the luxury of the
      new love&mdash;the holiness of the new nuptials&mdash;that have made us as
      one Being. Perhaps this restlessness, so unusual to me, will pass away&mdash;let
      us wait awhile. At present 'Sparta has many a worthier son.' One other
      year, one sweet summer, of the private life we have too much suffered to
      glide away, enjoyed, and then we will see whether the harsh realities of
      Ambition be worth either a concession or a dispute. Let us go into the
      country&mdash;to-morrow if you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Constance was about to answer, he sealed her lips with his kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Erpingham was not one of those who waver in what they deem a
      duty. She passed the night in stern and sleepless commune with herself;
      she was aware of all that she hazarded&mdash;all that she renounced: she
      was even tortured by scruples as to the strange oath that had almost
      unsexed her. Still, in spite of all, she felt that nothing would excuse
      her in suffering that gifted and happy intellect, now awakened from the
      sleep of the Sybarite, to fall back into its lazy and effeminate repose.
      She had no right to doom a human soul to rot away in its clay. Perhaps,
      too, she hoped, as all polemical enthusiasts do, that Godolphin, once
      aroused, would soon become her convert. Be that as it may, she delayed, on
      various pretences, their departure from London. She went secretly the next
      day to one of the proprietors of the close Boroughs, the existence of
      which was about to be annihilated, and a few days afterwards Godolphin
      received a letter informing him that he had been duly elected member for
      &mdash;&mdash;. I will not say what were his feelings at these tidings.
      Perhaps, such is man's proud and wayward heart, he felt shame to be so
      outdone by Constance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NEW VIEWS OF A PRIVILEGED ORDER.&mdash;THE DEATH-BED OF AUGUSTUS SAVILLE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This event might indeed have been an era in the life of Percy Godolphin,
      had that life been spared to a more extended limit than it was; and yet,
      so long had his ambition been smoothed and polished away by his
      peculiarities of thought, and so little was his calm and indifferent tone
      of mind suited to the hot contests and nightly warfare of parliamentary
      politics, that it is not probable he would ever have won a continuous and
      solid distinction in a career which requires either obtuseness of mind or
      enthusiasm of purpose to encounter the repeated mortifications and
      failures which the most brilliant debutant ordinarily endures. As it was,
      however, it produced a grave and solemn train of thought in Godolphin's
      breast. He mused much over his past life, and the musing did not satisfy
      him. He felt like one of those recorded in physiological history who have
      been in a trance for years: and now slowly awakening, he acknowledged the
      stir and rush of revived but confused emotions. Nature, perhaps, had
      intended Godolphin for a poet; for, with the exception of the love of
      glory, the poetical characteristics were rife within him; and over his
      whole past existence the dimness of unexpressed poetical sensation had
      clung and hovered. It was this which had deadened his soul to the active
      world, and wrapped him in the land of dreams; it was this which had
      induced that vague and restless dissatisfaction with the Actual which had
      brought the thirst for the Ideal; it was this which had made him
      fastidious in love, repining in pleasure, magnificent in luxury, seeking
      and despising all things in the same breath. There are many, perhaps, of
      this sort, who, having the poet's nature, have never found the poet's vent
      to his emotions; have wandered over the visionary world without chancing
      to discover the magic wand that was stored within the dark chamber of
      their mind, and would have reduced the visions into shape and substance.
      Alas! what existence can be more unfulfilled than that of one who has the
      soul of the poet and not the skill? who has the susceptibility and the
      craving, not the consolation or the reward?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if this cloud of dreamlike emotion had so long hung over Godolphin, it
      began now to melt away from his heart; a clearer and distincter view of
      the large objects of life lay before him; and he felt that he was
      standing, half stunned and passive, in the great crisis of his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was now fixed for their departure to Wendover, when Saville was
      taken alarmingly ill; Godolphin was sent for, late one evening. He found
      the soi-disant Epicurean at the point of death, but in perfect possession
      of his senses. The scene around him was emblematic of his life: save
      Godolphin, not a friend was by. Saville had some dozen or two of natural
      children&mdash;where were they? He had abandoned them to their fate: he
      knew not of their existence, nor they of his death. Lonely in his
      selfishness was he left to breathe out the small soul of a man of bon-ton!
      But I must do Saville the justice to say, that if he was without the
      mourners and the attendants that belonged to natural ties, he did not
      require them. His was no whimpering exit from life: the champagne was
      drained to the last drop; and Death, like the true boon companion, was
      about to shatter the empty glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my friend," said Saville, feebly, but pressing with weak fingers
      Godolphin's hand&mdash;"well, the game is up, the lights are going out,
      and presently the last guest will depart, and all be darkness!" here the
      doctor came to the bedside with a cordial. The dying man, before he took
      it, fixed upon the leech an eye which, although fast glazing, still
      retained something of its keen, searching shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now tell me, my good sir, how many hours more can you keep in this&mdash;this
      breath?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked at Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you," said Saville; "you are shy on these points. Never be
      shy, my good fellow; it is inexcusable after twenty: besides, it is a bad
      compliment to my nerves&mdash;a gentleman is prepared for every event.
      Sir, it is only a roturier whom death, or anything else, takes by
      surprise. How many hours, then, can I live?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not many, I fear, sir: perhaps until daybreak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My day breaks about twelve o'clock, p.m.," said Saville, as drily as his
      gasps would let him. "Very well;&mdash;give me the cordial;&mdash;don't
      let me go to sleep&mdash;I don't want to be cheated out of a minute. So,
      so&mdash;! I am better. You may withdraw, doctor. Let my spaniel come up.
      Bustle, Bustle!&mdash;poor fellow! poor fellow! Lie down, sir! be quiet!
      And now, Godolphin, a few words in farewell. I always liked you greatly;
      you know you were my protege, and you have turned out well. You have not
      been led away by the vulgar passions of politics, and place, and power.
      You have had power over power itself; you have not office, but you have
      fashion. You have made the greatest match in England; very prudently not
      marrying Constance Vernon, very prudently marrying Lady Erpingham. You are
      at the head and front of society; you have excellent taste, and spend your
      wealth properly. All this must make your conscience clear&mdash;a
      wonderful consolation! Always keep a sound conscience; it is a great
      blessing on one's death-bed&mdash;it is a great blessing tome in this
      hour, for I have played my part decently&mdash;eh?&mdash;I have enjoyed
      life, as much as so dull a possession can be enjoyed; I have loved, gamed,
      drunk, but I have never lost my character as a gentleman: thank Heaven, I
      have no remorse of that sort! Follow my example to the last and you will
      die as easily. I have left you my correspondence and my journal; you may
      publish them if you like; if not, burn them. They are full of amusing
      anecdotes; but I don't care for fame, as you well know&mdash;especially
      posthumous fame. Do as you please then, with my literary remains. Take
      care of my dog&mdash;'tis a good creature; and let me be quietly buried.
      No bad taste&mdash;no ostentation&mdash;no epitaph. I am very glad I die
      before the d&mdash;d Revolution that must come; I don't want to take wine
      with the Member for Holborn Bars. I am a type of a system; I expire before
      the system; my death is the herald of its fall."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these expressions&mdash;not continuously uttered, but at short
      intervals&mdash;Saville turned away his face: his breathing became thick:
      he fell into the slumber he had deprecated; and, after about an hour's
      silence, died away as insensibly as an infant. Sic transit glories mundi!
    </p>
    <p>
      The first living countenance beside the death-bed on which Godolphin's eye
      fell was that of Fanny Millinger; she (who had been much with Saville
      during his latter days, for her talk amused him, and her good-nature made
      her willing to amuse any one) had been, at his request, summoned also with
      Godolphin at the sudden turn of his disease. She was at the theatre at the
      time, and had only just arrived when the deceased had fallen into his last
      sleep. There, silent and shocked, she stood by the bed, opposite
      Godolphin. She had not stayed to change her stage-dress; and the tinsel
      and mock jewels glittered on the revolted eye of her quondam lover. What a
      type of the life just extinguished! What a satire on its mountebank
      artificialities!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some little time after, she joined Godolphin in the desolate apartment
      below. She put her hand in his, and her tears&mdash;for she wept easily&mdash;flowed
      fast down her cheeks, washing away the lavish rouge which imperfectly
      masked the wrinkles that Time had lately begun to sow on a surface
      Godolphin had remembered so fair and smooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Saville!" said she, falteringly; "he died without a pang. Ah! he had
      the best temper possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin sat by the writing-table of the deceased, shading his brow with
      the hand which the actress left disengaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fanny," said he, bitterly, after a pause, "the world is indeed a stage.
      It has lost a consummate actor, though in a small part."
    </p>
    <p>
      The saying was wrung from Godolphin&mdash;and was not said unkindly,
      though it seemed so&mdash;for he too had tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said she, "the play-house has indeed taught us, in our youth, many
      things which the real world could not teach us better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life differs from the play only in this," said Godolphin, some time
      afterwards; "it has no plot&mdash;all is vague, desultory, unconnected&mdash;till
      the curtain drops with the mystery unsolved."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were the last words that Godolphin ever addressed to the actress.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE JOURNEY AND THE SURPRISE.&mdash;A WALK IN THE SUMMER NIGHT.&mdash;THE
      STARS AND THE ASSOCIATION THAT MEMORY MAKES WITH NATURE.
    </p>
    <p>
      This event detained Godolphin some days longer in town. He saw the last
      rites performed to Saville, and he was present at the opening of the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in life Saville had never lent a helping hand to the distressed, as he
      had mixed with the wealthy only, so now to the wealthy only was his wealth
      devoted. The rich Godolphin was his principal heir; not a word was even
      said about his illegitimate children, not an inquiry ordained towards his
      poor relations. In this, as in all the formula of his will, Saville
      followed the prescribed customs of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast went the panting steeds that bore Constance and Godolphin from the
      desolate city. Bright was the summer sky, and green looked the smiling
      fields that lay on either side their road. Nature was awake and active.
      What a delicious contrast to the scenes of Art which they left behind!
      Constance exerted herself to the utmost to cheer the spirits of her
      companion, and succeeded. In the small compass which confined them
      together, their conversation flowed in confidence and intimate affection.
      Not since the first month of their union had they talked with less reserve
      and more entire love&mdash;only there was this difference in their topics
      they then talked of the future only, they now talked more of the past.
      They uttered many a fond regret over their several faults to each other;
      and, with clasped hands, congratulated themselves on their present reunion
      of heart. They allowed how much all things independent of affection had
      deceived them, and no longer exacting so much from love, they felt its
      real importance. Ah, why do all of us lose so many years in searching
      after happiness, but never inquiring into its nature! We are like one who
      collects the books of a thousand tongues, and knowing not their language,
      wonders why they do not delight him?
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, athwart the mind of Constance one dark image would ever and
      anon obtrude itself; the solitary and mystic Lucilla, with her erring
      brain and forlorn fortunes, was not even in happiness to be forgotten.
      There were times, too, in that short journey, when she felt the tale of
      her interview with that unhappy being rise to her lips: but ever when she
      looked on the countenance of Godolphin, beaming with more heartfelt and
      homeborn gladness than she had seen for years, she could not bear the
      thought of seeing it darkened by the pain her story would inflict; and she
      shrank from embittering moments so precious to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      All her endeavours to discover Lucilla had been in vain: but an unquiet
      presentiment that at any moment that discovery might be made, perhaps in
      the presence of Godolphin, constantly haunted her, and she even now looked
      painfully forth at each inn where they changed horses, lest the sad, stern
      features of the soothsayer should appear, and break that spell of happy
      quiet which now lay over the spirit of Godolphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was towards the evening that their carriage slowly wound up a steep and
      long ascent. The sun yet wanted an hour to its setting; and at their
      right, its slant and mellowed beams fell over rich fields, green with the
      prodigal luxuriance of June, and intersected by hedges from which, proud
      and frequent, the oak and elm threw forth their lengthened shadows. On
      their left the grass less fertile, and the spaces less inclosed, were
      whitened with flocks of sheep; and far and soft came the bleating of the
      lambs upon their ear. They saw not the shepherd nor any living form; but
      from between the thicker groups of trees the chimneys of peaceful cottages
      peered forth, and gave to the pastoral serenity of the scene that still
      and tranquil aspect of life which alone suited it. The busy wheel in the
      heart of Constance was at rest, and Godolphin's soul, steeped in the
      luxury of the present hour, felt that delicious happiness which would be
      heaven could it outlive the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Constance," whispered he, "why, since we return at last to these
      scenes, why should we ever leave them? Amidst them let us recall our
      youth!" Constance sighed, but with pleasure, and pressed Godolphin's hand
      to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now they had gained the hill, a sudden colour flushed over Godolphin's
      cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely," said he, "I remember this view. Yonder valley! This is not the
      road to Wendover Castle; this&mdash;my father's home!&mdash;the same, and
      not the same!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! Below, basking in the western light, lay the cottage in which
      Godolphin's childhood had been passed. There was the stream rippling
      merrily; there the broken and fern-clad turf, with "its old hereditary
      trees;" but the ruins!&mdash;the shattered arch, the mouldering tower,
      were left indeed&mdash;but new arches, new turrets had arisen, and so
      dexterously blended with the whole that Godolphin might have fancied the
      hall of his forefathers restored&mdash;not indeed in the same vast
      proportions and cumbrous grandeur as of old, but still alike in shape and
      outline, and such even in size as would have contented the proud heart of
      its last owner. Godolphin's eyes turned inquiringly to Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It should have been more consistent with its ancient dimensions," said
      she; "but then it would have taken half our lives to have built it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this must have been the work of years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your work, Constance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it was for this that you hesitated when I asked you to consent to
      raising the money for the purchase of Lord &mdash;&mdash;'s collection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes;&mdash;am I forgiven?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest Constance," said Godolphin, flinging his arms around her, "how
      have I wronged you! During those very years, then, of our estrangement&mdash;during
      those very years in which I thought you indifferent, you were silently
      preparing this noble revenge on the injury I did you. Why, why did I not
      know this before? Why did you not save us both from so long a
      misunderstanding of each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest Percy, I was to blame; but I always looked to this hour as to a
      pleasure of which I could not bear to rob myself. I always fancied that
      when this task was finished, and you could witness it, you would feel how
      uppermost you always were in my thoughts, and forgive me many faults from
      that consideration. I knew that I was executing your father's great wish;
      I knew that you always, although unconsciously, perhaps, sympathised in
      that wish. I only grieve that, as yet, it has been executed so
      imperfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how," continued Godolphin, gazing on the new pile as they now neared
      the entrance, "how was it this never reached my ears through other
      quarters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it did, Percy; don't you remember our country neighbour, Dartmour,
      complimenting you on your intended improvements, and you fancied it was
      irony, and turned your back on the discomfited squire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They now drove under the gates surmounted with Godolphin's arms; and in a
      few minutes more, they were within the renovated halls of the Priory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was impossible for Constance to have more sensibly touched and
      flattered Godolphin than by this surprise; it affected him far more than
      the political concession which to her had been so profound a sacrifice;
      for his early poverty had produced in him somewhat of that ancestral pride
      which the poor only can gracefully wear; and although the tie between his
      father and himself had not possessed much endearment, yet he had often,
      with the generosity that belonged to him, regretted that his parent had
      not survived to share in his present wealth, and to devote some portion of
      it to the realisation of those wishes which he had never been permitted to
      consummate. Godolphin, too, was precisely of a nature to appreciate the
      delicacy of Constance's conduct, and to be deeply penetrated by the
      thought that, while he was following a career so separate from hers, she,
      in the midst of all her ambitious projects, could pause to labour,
      unthanked and in concealment, for the delight of this hour's gratification
      to him: the delicacy and the forethought affected him the more, because
      they made not a part of the ordinary character of the high and absorbed
      ambition of Constance. He did not thank her much by words, but his looks
      betrayed all he felt, and Constance was overpaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the new portion of the building was necessarily not extensive,
      yet each chamber was of those grand proportions which suited the
      magnificent taste of Godolphin, and harmonised with the ancient ruins.
      Constance had shown her tact by leaving the ruins themselves (which it was
      profane to touch) unrestored; but so artfully were those connected with
      the modern addition, and thence with the apartments in the cottage, which
      she had not scrupled to remodel, that an effect was produced from the
      whole far more splendid than many Gothic buildings of greater extent and
      higher pretensions can afford. Godolphin wandered delightedly over the
      whole, charmed with the taste and judgment which presided over even the
      nicest arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, where," said he, struck with the accurate antiquity of some of the
      details, "where learned you all these minutiae? You are as wise as Hope
      himself upon cornices and tables."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was forced to leave these things to others," answered Constance; "but I
      took care that they possessed the necessary science."
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was exceedingly beautiful, and they walked forth under the
      summer moon among those grounds in which Constance had first seen
      Godolphin. They stood by the very rivulet&mdash;they paused at the very
      spot! On the murmuring bosom of the wave floated many a water-flower; and
      now and then a sudden splash, a sudden circle in the shallow stream,
      denoted the leap of the river-tyrant on his prey. There was a universal
      odor in the soft air; that delicate, that ineffable fragrance belonging to
      those midsummer nights which the rich English poetry might well people
      with Oberon and his fairies; the bat wheeled in many a ring along the air;
      but the gentle light bathed all things, and robbed his wanderings of the
      gloomier associations that belong to them; and ever, and ever, the busy
      moth darted to and fro among the flowers, or misled upwards by the stars
      whose beam allured it, wandered, like Desire after Happiness, in search of
      that light it might never reach. And those stars still, with their soft,
      unspeakable eyes of love, looked down upon Godolphin as of old, when, by
      the Italian lake, he roved with her for whom he had become the world
      itself. No, not now, nor ever, could he gaze upon those wan, mysterious
      orbs, and not feel the pang that reminded him of Lucilla! Between them and
      her was an affinity which his imagination could not sever. All whom we
      have loved have something in nature especially devoted to their memory; a
      peculiar flower, a breath of air, a leaf, a tone. What love is without
      some such association.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Striking the electric chain wherewith we're bound"?
</pre>
    <p>
      But the dim, and shadowy, and solemn stars were indeed meet remembrancers
      of Volktman's wild daughter; and so intimately was their light connected
      in Godolphin's breast with that one image, that their very softness had,
      to his eyes, something fearful and menacing&mdash;although as in sadness,
      not in anger.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE FULL RENEWAL OF LOVE.&mdash;HAPPINESS PRODUCES FEAR, "AND IN TO-DAY
      ALREADY WALKS TOMORROW."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, First Love! well sang the gay minstrel of France, that we return again
      and again to thee. As the earth returns to its spring, and is green once
      more, we go back to the life of life and forget the seasons that have
      rolled between! Whether it was&mdash;perhaps so&mdash;that in the minds of
      both was a feeling that their present state was not fated to endure;
      whether they felt, in the deep calm they enjoyed, that the storm was
      already at hand; whether this was the truth I know not; but certain it is,
      that during the short time they remained at Godolphin Priory, previous to
      their earthly separation, Constance and Godolphin were rather like lovers
      for the first time united, than like those who have dragged on the chain
      for years. Their perfect solitude, the absence of all intrusion, so unlike
      the life they had long passed, renewed all that charm, that rapture in
      each other's society, which belong to the first youth of love. True, that
      this could not have endured long; but Fate suffered it to endure to the
      last of that tether which remained to their union. Constance was not again
      doomed to the severe and grating shock which the sense of estrangement
      brings to a woman's heart; she was sensible that Godolphin was never so
      entirely, so passionately her own, as towards the close of their mortal
      connection. Every thing around them breathed of their first love. This was
      that home of Godolphin's to which, from the splendid halls of Wendover,
      the young soul of the proud orphan had so often and so mournfully flown
      with a yearning and wistful interest: this was that spot in which he,
      awaking from the fever of the world, had fed his first dreams of her. The
      scene, the solitude, was as a bath to their love: it braced, it freshened,
      it revived its tone. They wandered, they read, they thought together; the
      air of the spot was an intoxication. The world around and without was
      agitated; they felt it not: the breakers of the great deep died in murmurs
      on their ear. Ambition lulled its voice to Constance; Godolphin had
      realised his visions of the ideal. Time had dimmed their young beauty, but
      their eyes saw it not; they were young, they were all beautiful, to each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Constance hung on the steps of her lover&mdash;still let that name be
      his! She could not bear to lose him for a moment: a vague indistinctness
      of fear seized her if she saw him not. Again and again, in the slumbers of
      the night, she stretched forth her arms to feel that he was near; all her
      pride, her coldness seemed gone, as by a spell; she loved as the softest,
      the fondest, love. Are we, 0 Ruler of the future! imbued with the
      half-felt spirit of prophecy as the hour of evil approaches&mdash;the
      great, the fierce, the irremediable evil of a life? In this depth and
      intensity of their renewed passion, was there not something preternatural?
      Did they not tremble as they loved? They were on a spot to which the dark
      waters were slowly gathering; they clung to the Hour, for eternity was
      lowering round.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one evening that a foreboding emotion of this kind weighed heavily
      on Constance. She pressed Godolphin's hand in hers, and when he returned
      the pressure, she threw herself on his neck, and burst into tears.
      Godolphin was alarmed; he covered her cheek with kisses, he sought the
      cause of her emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no cause," answered Constance, recovering herself, but speaking
      in a faltering voice, "only I feel the impossibility that this happiness
      can last; its excess makes me shudder."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, the wind rose and swept mourningly over the large leaves of
      the chestnut-tree beneath which they stood: the serene stillness of the
      evening seemed gone; an unquiet and melancholy spirit was loosened abroad,
      and the chill of the sudden change which is so frequent to our climate,
      came piercingly upon them. Godolphin was silent for some moments, for the
      thought found a sympathy in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is it truly so?" he said at last; "is there really to be no permanent
      happiness for us below? Is pain always to tread the heels of pleasure? Are
      we never to say the harbour is reached, and we are safe? No, my
      Constance," he added, warming into the sanguine vein that traversed even
      his most desponding moods, "no! let us not cherish this dark belief; there
      is no experience for the future; one hour lies to the next; if what has
      been seem thus chequered, it is no type of what may be. We have discovered
      in each other that world that was long lost to our eyes; we cannot lose it
      again; death only can separate us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, death!" said Constance, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not recoil at that word, my Constance, for we are yet in the noon of
      life; why bring, like the Egyptian, the spectre to the feast? And, after
      all, if death come while we thus love, it is better than change and time&mdash;better
      than custom which palls&mdash;better than age which chills. Oh!" continued
      Godolphin, passionately, "oh! if this narrow shoal and sand of time be but
      a breathing-spot in the great heritage of immortality, why cheat ourselves
      with words so vague as life and death? What is the difference? At most,
      the entrance in and the departure from one scene in our wide career. How
      many scenes are left to us! We do but hasten our journey, not close it.
      Let us believe this, Constance, and cast from us all fear of our
      disunion."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Constance's eyes were fixed upon his face, and the deep calm
      that reigned there sank into her soul, and silenced its murmurs. The
      thought of futurity is that which Godolphin (because it is so with all
      idealists) must have revolved with the most frequent fervour; but it was a
      thought which he so rarely touched upon, that it was the first and only
      time Constance ever heard it breathed from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned into the house; and the mark is still in that page of the
      volume which they read, where the melodious accents of Godolphin died upon
      the heart of Constance. Can she ever turn to it again?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LXVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE LAST CONVERSATION BETWEEN GODOLPHIN AND CONSTANCE.&mdash;HIS THOUGHTS
      AND SOLITARY WALK AMIDST THE SCENES OF HIS YOUTH.&mdash;THE LETTER.&mdash;THE
      DEPARTURE.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had denied themselves to all the visitors who had attacked the
      Priory; but on their first arrival, they had deemed it necessary to
      conciliate their neighbours by concentrating into one formal act of
      hospitality all those social courtesies which they could not persuade
      themselves to relinquish their solitude in order singly to perform.
      Accordingly, a day had been fixed for one grand fete at the Priory; it was
      to follow close on the election, and be considered as in honour of that
      event. The evening for this gala succeeded that which I have recorded in
      the last chapter. It was with great reluctance that they prepared
      themselves to greet this sole interruption of their seclusion; and they
      laughed, although they did not laugh cordially, at the serious annoyance
      which the giving a ball was for the first time to occasion to persons who
      had been giving balls for a succession of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was remarkably still and close; the sun had not once pierced
      through the dull atmosphere, which was charged with the yet silent but
      gathering thunder; and as the evening came on, the sullen tokens of an
      approaching storm became more and more loweringly pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall not, I fear, have propitious weather for our festival to-night,"
      said Godolphin; "but after a general election, people's nerves are
      tolerably hardened: what are the petty fret and tumult of nature, lasting
      but an hour, to the angry and everlasting passions of men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A profound deduction from a wet night, dear Percy," said Constance,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like our friend C&mdash;&mdash;," rejoined Godolphin, in the same vein;
      "I can philosophise on the putting on one's gloves, you know:" and
      therewith their conversation flowed into a vein singularly contrasted with
      the character of the coming events. Time fled on as they were thus engaged
      until Constance started up, surprised at the lateness of the hour, to
      attend the duties of the toilette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wear this, dearest," said Godolphin, taking a rose from a flower-stand by
      the window, "in memory of that ball at Wendover Castle, which although
      itself passed bitterly enough for me, has yet left so many happy
      recollections." Constance put the rose into her bosom; its leaves were
      then all fresh and brilliant&mdash;so were her prospects for the future.
      He kissed her forehead as they parted;&mdash;they parted for the last
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, left alone, turned to the window, which, opening to the ground,
      invited him forth among the flowers that studded the grass-plots which
      sloped away to the dark and unwavering trees that girded the lawn. That
      pause of nature which precedes a storm ever had a peculiar attraction to
      his mind; and instinctively he sauntered from the house, wrapped in the
      dreaming, half-developed thought which belonged to his temperament.
      Mechanically he strayed on until he found himself beside the still lake
      which the hollows of the dismantled park embedded. There he paused, gazing
      unconsciously on the gloomy shadows which fell from the arches of the
      Priory and the tall trees around. Not a ripple stirred the broad expanse
      of waters; the birds had gone to rest; no sound, save the voice of the
      distant brook that fed the lake beside which, on the first night of his
      return to his ancestral home, he had wandered with Constance, broke the
      universal silence. That voice was never mute. All else might be dumb; but
      that living stream, rushing through its rocky bed, stilled not its
      repining music. Like the soul of the landscape is the gush of a fresh
      stream; it knows no sleep, no pause; it works for ever&mdash;the life, the
      cause of life to all around. The great frame of nature may repose, but the
      spirit of the waters rests not for a moment. As the soul of the landscape
      is the soul of man, in our deepest slumbers its course glides on, and
      works unsilent, unslumbering, through its destined channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      With slow step and folded arms Godolphin moved along. The well-remembered
      scenes of his childhood were all before him; the wild verdure of the fern,
      the broken ground, with its thousand mimic mounts and valleys, the deep
      dell overgrown with matted shrubs and dark as a wizard's cave; the remains
      of many a stately vista, where the tender green of the lime showed forth,
      even in that dusky light, beneath the richer leaves of the chestnut; all
      was familiar and home-breathing to his mind. Fragments of boyish verse,
      forgotten for years, rose hauntingly to his remembrance, telling of wild
      thoughts, unsatisfied dreams, disappointed hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am happy at last," said he aloud; "yes, happy. I have passed that
      bridge of life which divides us from the follies of youth; and better
      prospects, and nobler desires, extend before me. What a world of wisdom in
      that one saying of Radclyffe's, 'Benevolence is the sole cure to
      idealism;' to live for others draws us from demanding miracles for
      ourselves. What duty as yet have I fulfilled? I renounced ambition as
      unwise, and with it I renounced wisdom itself. I lived for pleasure&mdash;I
      lived the life of disappointment. Without one vicious disposition, I have
      fallen into a hundred vices; I have never been actively selfish, yet
      always selfish. I nursed high thoughts&mdash;for what end? A poet in
      heart, a voluptuary in life. If mine own interest came into clear
      collision with that of another, mine I would have sacrificed, but I never
      asked if the whole course of my existence was not that of a war with the
      universal interest. Too thoughtful to be without a leading principle in
      life, the one principle I adopted has been one error. I have tasted all
      that imagination can give to earthly possession: youth, health, liberty,
      knowledge, love, luxury, pomp. Woman was my first passion,&mdash;what
      woman have I wooed in vain? I imagined that my career hung upon
      Constance's breath&mdash;Constance loved and refused me. I attributed my
      errors to that refusal; Constance became mine&mdash;how have I retrieved
      them? A vague, a dim, an unconfessed remorse has pursued me in the memory
      of Lucilla; yet, why not have redeemed that fault to her by good to
      others? What is penitence not put into action, but the great fallacy in
      morals? A sin to one, if irremediable, can only be compensated by a virtue
      to some one else. Yet was I to blame in my conduct to Lucilla? Why should
      conscience so haunt me at that name? Did I not fly her? Was it not herself
      who compelled our union? Did I not cherish, respect, honour, forbear with
      her, more than I have since with my wedded Constance? Did I not resolve to
      renounce Constance herself, when most loved, for Lucilla's sake alone? Who
      prevented that sacrifice&mdash;who deserted me&mdash;who carved out her
      own separate life?&mdash;Lucilla herself. No, so far, my sin is light. But
      ought I not to have left all things to follow her, to discover her, to
      force upon her an independence from want, or possibly from crime? Ah,
      there was my sin, and the sin of my nature; the sin, too, of the children
      of the world&mdash;passive sin. I could sacrifice my happiness, but not my
      indolence; I was not ungenerous, I was inert. But is it too late? Can I
      not yet search, discover her, and remove from my mind the anxious burthen
      which her remembrance imposes on it? For, oh, one thought of remorse
      linked with the being who has loved us, is more intolerable to the
      conscience than the gravest crime!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Muttering such thoughts, Godolphin strayed on until the deepening night
      suddenly recalled his attention to the lateness of the hour. He turned to
      the house and entered his own apartment. Several of the guests had already
      come. Godolphin was yet dressing, when a servant knocked at the door and
      presented him with a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lay it on the table," said he to the valet; "it is probably some excuse
      about the ball."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said the servant, "a lad has just brought it from S&mdash;&mdash;,"
      naming a village about four miles distant; "and says he is to wait for an
      answer. He was ordered to ride as fast as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      With some impatience Godolphin took up the note; but the moment his eye
      rested on the writing, it fell from his hands; his cheek, his lips, grew
      as white as death; his heart seemed to refuse its functions; it was
      literally as if life stood still for a moment, as by the force of a sudden
      poison. With a strong effort he recovered himself, tore open the note, and
      read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Percy Godolphin, the hour has arrived-once more we shall meet. I summon
      you, fair love, to that meeting&mdash;the bed of death. Come! Lucilla
      Volktman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't alarm the countess," said Godolphin to his servant, in a very low,
      calm voice; "bring my horse to the postern, and send the bearer of this
      note to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger appeared&mdash;a rough country lad, of about eighteen or
      twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You brought this note?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, your honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, a sort of a strange lady as is lying at the 'Chequers,' and not
      expected to live. She be mortal bad, sir, and do run on awesome."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin pressed his hands convulsively together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how long has she been there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She only came about two hours since, sir; she came in a chaise, sir, and
      was taken so ill, that we sent for the doctor directly. He says she can't
      get over the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin walked to and fro, without trusting himself to speak, for some
      minutes. The boy stood by the door, pulling about his hat, and wondering,
      and staring, and thoroughly stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did she come alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, your honour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was no one with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes! a little nigger girl: she it was sent me with the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The horse is ready, sir," said the servant; "but had you not better have
      the carriage brought out? It looks very black; it must rain shortly, sir;
      and the ford between this and S&mdash;&mdash; is dangerous to cross in so
      dark a night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace!" cried Godolphin, with flashing eyes, and a low convulsive laugh.
      "Shall I ride to that death-bed at my ease and leisure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode rapidly down the stairs, and reached the small postern door: it
      was a part of the old building: one of the grooms held his impatient horse&mdash;the
      swiftest in his splendid stud; and the dim but flaring light, held by
      another of the servitors, streamed against the dull heavens and the
      imperfectly seen and frowning ruins of the ancient pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godolphin, unconscious of all around, and muttering to himself, leaped on
      his steed: the fire glinted from the coursers hoofs; and thus the last
      lord of that knightly race bade farewell to his father's halls. Those
      words which he had muttered, and which his favourite servant caught and
      superstitiously remembered, were the words in Lucilla's note&mdash;"The
      hour has arrived!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THE LAST.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A DREAD MEETING.&mdash;THE STORM.&mdash;THE CATASTROPHE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the humble pallet of the village inn lay the broken form of the
      astrologer's expiring daughter. The surgeon of the place sat by the
      bedside, dismayed and terrified, despite his hardened vocation, by the
      wild words and ghastly shrieks that ever and anon burst from the lips of
      the dying woman. The words were, indeed, uttered in a foreign tongue
      unfamiliar to the leech, a language not ordinarily suited to inspire
      terror; the language of love, and poetry, and music, the language of the
      sweet South. But, uttered in that voice where the passions of the soul
      still wrestled against the gathering weakness of the frame, the soft
      syllables sounded harsh and fearful; and the dishevelled locks of the
      sufferer&mdash;the wandering fire of the sunken eyes&mdash;the distorted
      gestures of the thin, transparent arms, gave fierce effect to the unknown
      words, and betrayed the dark strength of the delirium which raged upon
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One wretched light on the rude table opposite the bed broke the gloom of
      the mean chamber; and across the window flashed the first lightnings of
      the storm about to break. By the other side of the bed sat, mute,
      watchful, tearless, the Moorish girl, who was Lucilla's sole attendant&mdash;her
      eyes fixed on the sufferer with faithful, unwearying love; her ears
      listening, with all the quick sense of her race, to catch, amidst the
      growing noises of the storm, and the tread of hurrying steps below, the
      expected sound of the hoofs that should herald Godolphin's approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as if exhausted by the paroxysm of her disease, Lucilla's voice
      sank into silence; and she lay so still, so motionless, that, but for the
      faint and wavering pulse of the hand, which the surgeon was now suffered
      to hold, they might have believed the tortured spirit was already
      released. This torpor lasted for some minutes, when, raising herself up,
      as a bright gleam of intelligence stole over the hollow cheeks, Lucilla
      put her finger to her lips, smiled, and said, in a low, clear voice,
      "Hark! he comes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moor crept across the chamber, and opening the door, stood there in a
      listening attitude. She, as yet, heard not the tread of the speeding
      charger;&mdash;a moment, and it smote her ear; a moment more it halted by
      the inn door: the snort of the panting horse&mdash;the rush of steps&mdash;Percy
      Godolphin was in the room&mdash;was by the bedside&mdash;the poor sufferer
      was in his arms; and softened, thrilled, overpowered, Lucilla resigned
      herself to that dear caress; she drank in the sobs of his choked voice;
      she felt still, as in happier days, burning into her heart, the magic of
      his kisses. One instant of youth, of love, of hope, broke into that
      desolate and fearful hour, and silent and scarcely conscious tears gushed
      from her aching eyes, and laved, as it were, the burthen and the agony
      from her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moor traversed the room, and, laying one hand on the surgeon's
      shoulder, pointed to the door. Lucilla and Godolphin were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said he, at last finding voice, "is it thus&mdash;thus we meet? But
      say not that you are dying, Lucilla! have mercy, mercy upon your betrayer,
      your&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he could utter no more; he sank beside her, covering his face with
      his hands, and sobbing bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The momentary lucid interval for Lucilla had passed away; the maniac
      rapture returned, although in a wild and solemn shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blame not yourself," said she, earnestly; "the remorseless stars are the
      sole betrayers: yet, bright and lovely as they once seemed when they
      assured me of a bond between thee and me, I could not dream that their
      still and shining lore could forebode such gloomy truths. Oh, Percy! since
      we parted, the earth has not been as the earth to me: the Natural has left
      my life; a weird and roving spirit has entered my breast, and filled my
      brain, and possessed my thoughts, and moved every spring of my existence:
      the sun and the air, the green herb, the freshness and glory of the world,
      have been covered with a mist in which only dim shapes of dread were
      shadowed forth. But thou, my love, on whose breast I have dreamed such
      blessed dreams, wert not to blame. No! the power that crushes we cannot
      accuse: the heavens are above the reach of our reproach; they smile upon
      our agony; they bid the seasons roll on, unmoved and unsympathising, above
      our broken hearts. And what has been my course since your last kiss on
      these dying lips? Godolphin,"&mdash;and here Lucilla drew herself apart
      from him, and writhed, as with some bitter memory,&mdash;"these lips have
      felt other kisses, and these ears have drunk unhallowed sounds, and wild
      revelry and wilder passion have made me laugh over the sepulchre of my
      soul. But I am a poor creature; pour, poor&mdash;mad, Percy&mdash;mad&mdash;they
      tell me so!" Then, in the sudden changes incident to her disease, Lucilla
      continued&mdash;"I saw your bride, Percy, when your bore her from Rome,
      and the wheels of your bridal carriage swept over me, for I flung myself
      in their way; but they scratched me not; the bright demons above ordained
      otherwise, and I wandered over the world; but you shall know not," added
      Lucilla, with a laugh of dreadful levity, "whither or with whom, for we
      must have concealments, my love, as you will confess; and I strove to
      forget you, and my brain sank in the effort. I felt my frame withering,
      and they told me my doom was fixed, and I resolved to come to England, and
      look on my first love once more; so I came, and I saw you, Godolphin; and
      I knew, by the wrinkles in your brow, and the musing thought in your eye,
      that your proud lot had not brought you content. And then there came to me
      a stately shape, and I knew it for her for whom you had deserted me: she
      told me, as you tell me, to live, to forget the past. Mockery, mockery!
      But my heart is proud as hers, Percy, and I would not stoop to the
      kindness of a triumphant rival; and I fled, what matters it whither? But
      listen, Percy, listen; my woes have made me wise in that science which is
      not of heart, and I knew that you and I must meet once more, and that that
      meeting would be in this hour; and I counted, minute by minute, with a
      savage gladness, the days that were to bring on this interview and my
      death!" Then raising her voice into a wild shriek&mdash;"Beware, beware,
      Percy!-the rush of waters is on my ear-the splash, the gurgle!&mdash;Beware!&mdash;your
      last hour, also; is at hand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment in which she uttered these words, Lucilla relapsed into
      her former frantic paroxysms. Shriek followed shriek; she appeared to know
      none around her, not even Godolphin. With throes and agony the soul seemed
      to wrench itself from the frame. The hours swept on&mdash;midnight came&mdash;clear
      and distinct the voice of the clock below reached that chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" cried Lucilla, starting. "Hush!" and just at that moment, through
      the window opposite, the huge clouds, breaking in one spot, discovered
      high and far above them a solitary star.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thine, thine, Godolphin!" she shrieked forth, pointing to the lonely orb;
      "it summons thee;&mdash;farewell, but not for long!"
    </p>
    <hr />
    <hr />
    <hr />
    <p>
      The Moor rushed forward with a loud cry; she placed her hand on Lucilla's
      bosom; the heart was still, the breath was gone, the fire had vanished
      from the ashes: that strange unearthly spirit was perhaps with the stars
      for whose mysteries it had so vainly yearned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down fell the black rain in torrents; and far from the mountains you might
      hear the rushing of the swollen streams, as they poured into the bosom of
      the valleys. The sullen, continued mass of cloud was broken, and the
      vapours hurried fast and louring over the heavens, leaving now and then a
      star to glitter forth ere again "the jaws of darkness did devour it up."
      At the lower verge of the horizon, the lightning flashed fierce, but at
      lingering intervals; the trees rocked and groaned beneath the rain and
      storm; and, immediately above the bowed head of a solitary horseman, broke
      the thunder that, amidst the whirl of his own emotions, he scarcely heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside a stream, which the rains had already swelled, was a gipsy
      encampment; and as some of the dusky itinerants, waiting perhaps the
      return of a part of their band from a predatory excursion, cowered over
      the flickering fires in their tent, they perceived the horseman rapidly
      approaching the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See to yon gentry cove," cried one of the band; "'tis the same we saw in
      the forenight crossing the ford above. He has taken a short cut, the
      buzzard! and will have to go round again to the ford; a precious time to
      be gallivanting about!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pish!" said an old hag; "I love to see the proud ones tasting the bitter
      wind and rain as we bear alway; 'tis but a mile longer round to the ford.
      I wish it was twenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" cried the first speaker; "the fool takes to the water. He'll be
      drowned; the banks are too high and rough to land man or horse yonder.
      Hallo!" and with that painful sympathy which the hardest feel at the
      imminent peril of another when immediately subjected to their eyes, the
      gipsy ran forth into the pelting storm, shouting to the traveller to halt.
      For one moment Godolphin's steed still shrunk back from the rushing tide:
      deep darkness was over the water; and the horseman saw not the height of
      the opposite banks. The shout of the gipsy sounded to his ear like the cry
      of the dead whom he had left: he dashed his heels into the sides of the
      reluctant horse, and was in the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Light&mdash;light the torches!" cried the gipsy; and in a few moments the
      banks were illumined with many a brand from the fire, which the rain
      however almost instantly extinguished; yet, by that momentary light, they
      saw the noble animal breasting the waters, and perceived that Godolphin,
      discovering by the depth his mistake, had already turned the horse's head
      in the direction of the ford: they could see no more, but they shouted to
      Godolphin to turn back to the place from which he had plunged; and, in a
      few minutes afterwards, they heard, several yards above, the horse
      clambering up the rugged banks, which there were steep and high, and
      crushing the boughs that clothed the ascent. They thought, at the same
      time, that they distinguished also the splash of a heavy substance in the
      waves; but they fancied it some detached fragment of earth or stone, and
      turned to their tent, in the belief that the daring rider had escaped the
      peril he had so madly incurred. That night the riderless steed of
      Godolphin arrived at the porch of the Priory, where Constance, alarmed,
      pale, breathless, stood exposed to the storm, awaiting the return of
      Godolphin, or the messengers she had despatched in search of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak his corpse was found by the shallows of the ford; and the mark
      of violence across the temples, as of some blow, led them to guess that in
      scaling the banks his head had struck against one of the tossing boughs
      that overhung them, and the blow had precipitated him into the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTER FROM CONSTANCE, COUNTESS OF ERPINGHAM, TO * * *.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                           August, 1832.
</pre>
    <p>
      "I have read the work you have so kindly compiled from the papers
      transmitted to your care, and from your own intimate knowledge of those to
      whom they relate;&mdash;you have in much fulfilled my wishes with singular
      success. On the one hand, I have been anxious that a History should be
      given to the world, from which lessons so deep and, I firmly believe,
      salutary, may be generally derived: on the other hand, I have been anxious
      that it should be clothed in such disguises, that the names of the real
      actors in the drama should be for ever a secret. Both these objects you
      have attained. It is impossible I think, for any one to read the book
      about to be published, without being impressed with the truth of the moral
      it is intended to convey, and without seeing, by a thousand infallible
      signs, that its spring and its general course have flowed from reality and
      not fiction. Yet have you, by a few light alterations and addition,
      managed to effect that concealment of names and persons, which is due no
      less to the living than to the memory of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far I thank you from my heart: but in one point you have utterly
      failed. You have done no justice to the noble character you meant to
      delineate under the name of Godolphin; you have drawn his likeness with a
      harsh and cruel pencil; you have enlarged on the few weaknesses he might
      have possessed, until you have made them the foreground of the portrait;
      and his vivid generosity, his high honour, his brilliant intellect, the
      extraordinary stores of his mind, you have left in shadow. Oh, God! that
      for such a being such a destiny was reserved! and in the prime of life,
      just when his mind had awakened to a sense of its own powers and their
      legitimate objects! What a fatal system of things, that could for
      thirty-seven years have led away, by the pursuits and dissipations of a
      life suited but to the beings be despised, a genius of such an order, a
      heart of such tender emotions!(1) But on this subject I cannot, cannot
      write. I must lay down the pen: to-morrow I will try and force myself to
      resume it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I say, you have not done justice to him. I beseech you to
      remodel that character, and atone to the memory of one, whom none ever saw
      but to admire, or knew but to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of me,&mdash;of me, the vain, the scheming, the proud, the unfeminine
      cherishes of bitter thoughts, of stern designs,&mdash;of me, on the other
      hand, how flattering is the picture you have drawn! In that flattery is my
      sure disguise; therefore, I will not ask you to shade it into the poor and
      unlovely truth. But while, with agony and shame, I feel that you have
      rightly described that seeming neglectfulness of one no more, which sprang
      from the pride that believed itself neglected, you have not said enough&mdash;no,
      not one millionth part enough&mdash;of the real love that I constantly
      bore to him: the only soft and redeeming portion of my nature. But who can
      know, who can describe what another feels? Even I knew not what I felt,
      until death taught it me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I have read the whole book, one thought constantly haunts me&mdash;the
      strangeness that I should survive his loss; that the stubborn strings of
      my heart have not been broken long since; that I live, and live, too,
      amidst the world! Ay, but not one of the world; with that consciousness I
      sustain myself in the petty and sterile career of life. Shut out
      henceforth and for ever, from all the tenderer feelings that belong to my
      sex; without mother, husband, child, or friend; unloved and unloving, I
      support myself by the belief that I have done the little suffered to my
      sex in expediting the great change which is advancing on the world; and I
      cheer myself by the firm assurance that, sooner or later, a time must
      come, when those vast disparities in life which have been fatal, not to
      myself alone, but to all I have admired and loved; which render the great
      heartless, and the lowly servile; which make genius either an enemy to
      mankind or the victim to itself; which debase the energetic purpose; which
      fritter away the ennobling sentiment; which cool the heart and fetter the
      capacities, and are favorable only to the general development of the
      Mediocre and the Lukewarm, shall, if never utterly removed, at least be
      smoothed away into more genial and unobstructed elements of society. Alas!
      it is with an aching eye that we look abroad for the only solace, the only
      occupation of life,&mdash;Solitude at home, and Memory at our hearth."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE END.
    </p>
    <p>
      (1) The reader will acquit me of the charge of injustice to Godolphin's
      character when he arrives at this sentence; it conveys exactly the
      impression that my delineation, faithful to truth, is intended to convey&mdash;the
      influences of our actual world on the ideal and imaginative order of mind,
      when that mind is without the stimulus of pursuits at once practical and
      ennobling.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
