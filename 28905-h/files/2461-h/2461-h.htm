    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      An indistinct recollection of the very pretty little tale, called &ldquo;The
      Bellows-Mender,&rdquo; suggested the plot of this Drama. The incidents are,
      however, greatly altered from those in the tale, and the characters
      entirely re-cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having long had a wish to illustrate certain periods of the French
      history, so, in the selection of the date in which the scenes of this play
      are laid, I saw that the era of the Republic was that in which the
      incidents were rendered most probable, in which the probationary career of
      the hero could well be made sufficiently rapid for dramatic effect, and in
      which the character of the time itself was depicted by the agencies
      necessary to the conduct of the narrative. For during the early years of
      the first and most brilliant successes of the French Republic, in the
      general ferment of society, and the brief equalization of ranks, Claude&rsquo;s
      high-placed love; his ardent feelings, his unsettled principles (the
      struggle between which makes the passion of this drama), his ambition, and
      his career, were phenomena that characterized the age, and in which the
      spirit of the nation went along with the extravagance of the individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play itself was composed with a twofold object. In the first place,
      sympathizing with the enterprise of Mr. Macready, as Manager of Covent
      Garden, and believing that many of the higher interests of the Drama were
      involved in the success or failure of an enterprise equally hazardous and
      disinterested, I felt, if I may so presume to express myself, something of
      the Brotherhood of Art; and it was only for Mr. Macready to think it
      possible that I might serve him in order to induce me to make the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, in that attempt I was mainly anxious to see whether or not,
      after the comparative failure on the stage of &ldquo;The Duchess de la
      Valliere,&rdquo; certain critics had truly declared that it was not in my power
      to attain the art of dramatic construction and theatrical effect. I felt,
      indeed, that it was in this that a writer, accustomed to the narrative
      class of composition, would have the most both to learn and unlearn.
      Accordingly, it was to the development of the plot and the arrangement of
      the incidents that I directed my chief attention;&mdash;and I sought to
      throw whatever belongs to poetry less into the diction and the &ldquo;felicity
      of words&rdquo; than into the construction of the story, the creation of the
      characters, and the spirit of the pervading sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The authorship of the play was neither avowed nor suspected until the play
      had established itself in public favor. The announcement of my name was
      the signal for attacks, chiefly political, to which it is now needless to
      refer. When a work has outlived for some time the earlier hostilities of
      criticism, there comes a new race of critics to which a writer may, for
      the most part, calmly trust for a fair consideration, whether of the
      faults or the merits of his performance.

    <p>
      A room in the house of M. DESCHAPPELLES, at Lyons. PAULINE reclining on a
      sofa; MARIAN, her maid, fanning her&mdash;Flowers and notes on a table
      beside the sofa&mdash;MADAME DESCHAPPELLES seated&mdash;The gardens are
      seen from the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Marian, put that rose a little more to the left.&mdash;[MARIAN
      alters the position of a rose in PAULINE&rsquo;s hair.]&mdash;Ah, so!&mdash;that
      improves the hair,&mdash;the tournure, the j&rsquo;e ne sais quoi!&mdash;You are
      certainly very handsome, child!&mdash;quite my style;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wonder
      that you make such a sensation!&mdash;Old, young, rich, and poor, do
      homage to the Beauty of Lyons!&mdash;Ah, we live again in our children,&mdash;especially
      when they have our eyes and complexion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline [languidly]. Dear mother, you spoil your Pauline!&mdash;[Aside.] I
      wish I knew who sent me these flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. No, child!&mdash;If I praise you, it is only to inspire you
      with a proper ambition.&mdash;You are born to make a great marriage.&mdash;Beauty
      is valuable or worthless according as you invest the property to the best
      advantage. Marian, go and order the carriage! [Exit MARIAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Who can it be that sends me, every day, these beautiful flowers?&mdash;how
      sweet they are!
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter Servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Servant. Monsieur Beauseant, Madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Let him enter. Pauline, this is another offer!&mdash;I know
      it is!&mdash;Your father should engage an additional clerk to keep the
      account-book of your conquests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter BEAUSEANT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Ah, ladies how fortunate I am to find you at home!&mdash;[Aside.]
      How lovely she looks!&mdash;It is a great sacrifice I make in marrying
      into a family in trade!&mdash;they will be eternally grateful!&mdash;[Aloud.]
      Madam, you will permit me a word with your charming daughter.&mdash;[Approaches
      PAULINE, who rises disdainfully.]&mdash;Mademoiselle, I have ventured to
      wait upon you, in a hope that you must long since have divined. Last
      night, when you outshone all the beauty of Lyons, you completed your
      conquest over me! You know that my fortune is not exceeded by any estate
      in the province,&mdash;you know that, but for the Revolution, which has
      defrauded me of my titles, I should be noble. May I, then, trust that you
      will not reject my alliance? I offer you my hand and heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline [aside.] He has the air of a man who confers a favor!&mdash;[Aloud.]
      Sir, you are very condescending&mdash;I thank you humbly; but, being duly
      sensible of my own demerits, you must allow me to decline the honor you
      propose. [Curtsies, and turns away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Decline! Impossible!&mdash;you are not serious!&mdash;Madam, suffer
      me to appeal to you. I am a suitor for your daughter&rsquo;s hand&mdash;the
      settlements shall be worthy of her beauty and my station. May I wait on M.
      Deschappelles?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. M. Deschappelles never interferes in the domestic
      arrangements,&mdash;you are very obliging. If you were still a marquis, or
      if my daughter were intended to marry a commoner,&mdash;why, perhaps, we
      might give you the preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. A commoner!&mdash;we are all commoners in France now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. In France, yes; but there is a nobility still left in the
      other countries in Europe. We are quite aware of your good qualities, and
      don&rsquo;t doubt that you will find some lady more suitable to your
      pretensions. We shall be always happy to see you as an acquaintance, M.
      Beauseant!&mdash;My dear child, the carriage will be here presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Say no more, madam!&mdash;say no more!&mdash;[Aside.] Refused! and
      by a merchant&rsquo;s daughter!&mdash;refused! It will be all over Lyons before
      sunset!&mdash;I will go and bury myself in my chateau, study philosophy,
      and turn woman-hater. Refused! they ought to be sent to a madhouse!&mdash;
      Ladies, I have the honor to wish you a very good morning. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. How forward these men are!&mdash;I think, child, we kept up
      our dignity. Any girl, however inexperienced, knows how to accept an
      offer, but it requires a vast deal of address to refuse one with proper
      condescension and disdain. I used to practise it at school with the
      dancing-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter DAMAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Good morning, cousin Deschappelles.&mdash;Well, Pauline, are you
      recovered from last night&rsquo;s ball?&mdash;So many triumphs must be very
      fatiguing. Even M. Glavis sighed most piteously when you departed; but
      that might be the effect of the supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. M. Glavis, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. M. Glavis?&mdash;as if my daughter would think of M. Glavis!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Hey-day!&mdash;why not?&mdash;His father left him a very pretty
      fortune, and his birth is higher than yours, cousin Deschappelles. But
      perhaps you are looking to M. Beauseant,&mdash;his father was a marquis
      before the Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. M. Beauseant!&mdash;Cousin, you delight in tormenting me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Don&rsquo;t mind him, Pauline!&mdash;Cousin Damas, you have no
      susceptibility of feeling,&mdash;there is a certain indelicacy in all your
      ideas.&mdash;M. Beauseant knows already that he is no match for my
      daughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Pooh! pooh! one would think you intended your daughter to marry a
      prince!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Well, and if I did?&mdash;what then?&mdash;Many a foreign
      prince&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas [interrupting her]. Foreign prince!&mdash;foreign fiddlestick!&mdash;you
      ought to be ashamed of such nonsense at your time of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. My time of life!&mdash;That is an expression never applied
      to any lady till she is sixty-nine and three-quarters;&mdash;and only then
      by the clergyman of the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter Servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Servant. Madame, the carriage is at the door. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Come, child, put on your bonnet&mdash;you really have a very
      thorough-bred air&mdash;not at all like your poor father.&mdash;[Fondly].
      Ah, you little coquette! when a young lady is always making mischief, it
      is a sure sign that she takes after her mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Good day, cousin Damas&mdash;and a better humor to you.&mdash;[Going
      back to the table and taking the flowers]. Who could have sent me these
      flowers? [Exeunt PAULINE and MADAME DESCHAPPELLES.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. That would be an excellent girl if her head had not been turned. I
      fear she is now become incorrigible! Zounds, what a lucky fellow I am to
      be still a bachelor! They may talk of the devotion of the sex&mdash;but
      the most faithful attachment in life is that of a woman in love&mdash;with
      herself. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCENE II.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exterior of a small Village Inn&mdash;sign, the Golden Lion&mdash;A
      few leagues from Lyons, which is seen at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [behind the scenes.] Yes, you may bait the horses; we shall rest
      here an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Really, my dear Beauseant, consider that I have promised to spend a
      day or two with you at your chateau, that I am quite at your mercy for my
      entertainment,&mdash;and yet you are as silent and as gloomy as a mute at
      a funeral, or an Englishman at a party of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Bear with me!&mdash;the fact is that I am miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. You&mdash;the richest and gayest bachelor in Lyons?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. It is because I am a bachelor that I am miserable.&mdash;Thou
      knowest Pauline&mdash;the only daughter of the rich merchant, Mons.
      Deschappelles?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Know her?&mdash;who does not?&mdash;as pretty as Venus, and as proud
      as Juno.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Her taste is worse than her pride.&mdash;[Drawing himself up.] Know,
      Glavis, she has actually refused me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. [aside]. So she has me!&mdash;very consoling! In all cases of
      heart-ache, the application of another man&rsquo;s disappointment draws out the
      pain and allays the irritation.&mdash;[Aloud.] Refused you! and wherefore?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. I know not, unless it be because the Revolution swept away my
      father&rsquo;s title of Marquis,&mdash;and she will not marry a commoner. Now,
      as we have no noblemen left in France,&mdash;as we are all citizens and
      equals, she can only hope that, in spite of the war, some English Milord
      or German Count will risk his life, by coming to Lyons, that this fille du
      Roturier may condescend to accept him. Refused me, and with scorn!&mdash;By
      Heaven, I&rsquo;ll not submit to it tamely:&mdash;I&rsquo;m in a perfect fever of
      mortification and rage.&mdash;Refuse me, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Be comforted, my dear fellow,&mdash;I will tell you a secret. For the
      same reason she refused ME!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. You!&mdash;that&rsquo;s a very different matter! But give me your hand,
      Glavis,&mdash;we&rsquo;ll think of some plan to humble her. Mille diables! I
      should like to see her married to a strolling player!
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter Landlord and his Daughter from the Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Your servant, citizen Beauseant,&mdash;servant, Sir. Perhaps you
      will take dinner before you proceed to your chateau; our larder is most
      plentifully supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. I have no appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Nor I. Still it is bad travelling on an empty stomach. What have you
      got? [Takes and looks over the bill of fare.]
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shout without.] &ldquo;Long live the Prince!&mdash;Long live the Prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beau. The Prince!&mdash;what Prince is that? I thought we had no princes
      left in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Ha, ha! the lads always call him Prince. He has just won the prize
      in the shooting-match, and they are taking him home in triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Him! and who&rsquo;s Mr. Him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Who should he be but the pride of the village, Claude Melnotte?&mdash;Of
      course you have heard of Claude Melnotte?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. [giving back the bill of fare.] Never had that honor. Soup&mdash;ragout
      of hare&mdash;roast chicken, and, in short, all you have!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. The son of old Alelnotte, the gardener?
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Exactly so&mdash;a wonderful young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. How, wonderful?&mdash;Are his cabbages better than other people&rsquo;s
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Nay, he don&rsquo;t garden any more; his father left him well off. He&rsquo;s
      only a genus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. A what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. A genus!&mdash;a man who can do everything in life except anything
      that&rsquo;s useful&mdash;that&rsquo;s a genus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. You raise my curiosity;&mdash;proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Well, then, about four years ago, old Melnotte died, and left his
      son well to do in the world. We then all observed that a great change came
      over young Claude: he took to reading and Latin, and hired a professor
      from Lyons, who had so much in his head that he was forced to wear a great
      full-bottom wig to cover it. Then he took a fencing-master, and a
      dancing-master, and a music-master; and then he learned to paint; and at
      last it was said that young Claude was to go to Paris, and set up for a
      painter. The lads laughed at him at first; but he is a stout fellow, is
      Claude, and as brave as a lion, and soon taught them to laugh the wrong
      side of their mouths; and now all the boys swear by him, and all the girls
      pray for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. A promising youth, certainly! And why do they call him Prince?
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Partly because he is at the head of them all, and partly because he
      has such a proud way with him, and wears such fine clothes&mdash;and, in
      short, looks like a prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. And what could have turned the foolish fellow&rsquo;s brain? The
      Revolution, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Yes&mdash;the revolution that turns us all topsy-turvy&mdash;the
      revolution of Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Romantic young Corydon! And with whom is he in love?
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Why&mdash;but it is a secret, gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Oh! certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Why, then, I hear from his mother, good soul! that it is no less a
      person than the Beauty of Lyons, Pauline Deschappelles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. and Glavis. Ha, ha!&mdash;Capital!
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. You may laugh, but it is as true as I stand here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. And what does the Beauty of Lyons say to his suit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Lord, sir, she never even condescended to look at him, though when
      he was a boy he worked in her father&rsquo;s garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Are you sure of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. His mother says that Mademoiselle does not know him by sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [taking Glavis aside]. I have hit it,&mdash;I have it; here is our
      revenge! Here is a prince for our haughty damsel. Do you take me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Deuce take me if I do!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Blockhead!&mdash;it&rsquo;s as clear as a map. What if we could make this
      elegant clown pass himself off as a foreign prince?&mdash;lend him money,
      clothes, equipage for the purpose?&mdash;make him propose to Pauline?&mdash;marry
      Pauline? Would it not be delicious?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Ha, ha!&mdash;Excellent! But how shall we support the necessary
      expenses of his highness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Pshaw! Revenge is worth a much larger sacrifice than a few hundred
      louis;&mdash;as for details, my valet is the trustiest fellow, in the
      world, and shall have the appointment of his highness&rsquo;s establishment.
      Let&rsquo;s go to him at once, and see if he be really this Admirable Crichton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. With all my heart;&mdash;but the dinner?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Always thinking of dinner! Hark ye, landlord; how far is it to young
      Melnotte&rsquo;s cottage? I should like to see such a prodigy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Turn down the lane,&mdash;then strike across the common,&mdash;and
      you will see his mother&rsquo;s cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. True, he lives with his mother.&mdash;[Aside.] We will not trust to
      an old woman&rsquo;s discretion; better send for him hither. I&rsquo;ll just step in
      and write a note. Come, Glavis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Yes,&mdash;Beauseant, Glavis, and Co., manufacturers of princes,
      wholesale and retail,&mdash;an uncommonly genteel line of business. But
      why so grave?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. You think only of the sport,&mdash;I of the revenge. [Exeunt within
      the Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCENE III.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of MELNOTTE&rsquo;S cottage; flowers placed here and there; a
      guitar on an oaken table, with a portfolio, etc.; a picture on an easel,
      covered by a curtain; fencing foils crossed over the mantelpiece; an
      attempt at refinement in site of the homeliness of the furniture, etc.; a
      staircase to the right conducts to the upper story.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shout without]. &ldquo;Long live Claude Melnotte!&rdquo; &ldquo;Long live the Prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Widow Mel. Hark!&mdash;there&rsquo;s my dear son;&mdash;carried off the
      prize, I&rsquo;m sure; and now he&rsquo;ll want to treat them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claude Mel. [opening the door]. What! you will not come in, my friends!
      Well, well, there&rsquo;s a trifle to make merry elsewhere. Good day to you all,&mdash;good
      day!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Shout]. &ldquo;Hurrah! Long live Prince Claude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enter CLAUDE MELNOTTE, with a rifle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Give me joy, dear mother!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve won the prize!&mdash;never
      missed one shot! Is it not handsome, this gun?
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Humph!&mdash;Well, what is it worth, Claude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Worth! What is a riband worth to a soldier? Worth! everything! Glory
      is priceless!
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Leave glory to great folks. Ah! Claude, Claude, castles in the air
      cost a vast deal to keep up! How is all this to end? What good does it do
      thee to learn Latin, and sing songs, and play on the guitar, and fence,
      and dance, and paint pictures? All very fine; but what does it bring in?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Wealth! wealth, my mother! Wealth to the mind&mdash;wealth to the
      heart&mdash;high thoughts&mdash;bright dreams&mdash;the hope of fame&mdash;the
      ambition to be worthier to love Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. My poor son!&mdash;The young lady will never think of thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Do the stars think of us? Yet if the prisoner see them shine into his
      dungeon, wouldst thou bid him turn away from their lustre? Even so from
      this low cell, poverty, I lift my eyes to Pauline and forget my chains.&mdash;[Goes
      to the picture and draws aside the curtain.]
    </p>
    <p>
      See, this is her image&mdash;painted from memory. Oh, how the canvas
      wrongs her!&mdash;[Takes up the brush and throws it aside.] I shall never
      be a painter! I can paint no likeness but one, and that is above all art.
      I would turn soldier&mdash;France needs soldiers! But to leave the air
      that Pauline breathes! What is the hour?&mdash;so late? I will tell thee a
      secret, mother. Thou knowest that for the last six weeks I have sent every
      day the rarest flowers to Pauline?&mdash;she wears them. I have seen them
      on her breast. Ah, and then the whole universe seemed filled with odors! I
      have now grown more bold&mdash;I have poured my worship into poetry&mdash;I
      have sent the verses to Pauline&mdash;I have signed them with my own name.
      My messenger ought to&mdash;be back by this time. I bade him wait for the
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. And what answer do you expect, Claude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. That which the Queen of Navarre sent to the poor troubadour:&mdash;&ldquo;Let
      me see the Oracle that can tell nations I am beautiful!&rdquo; She will admit
      me. I shall hear her speak&mdash;I shall meet her eyes&mdash;I shall read
      upon her cheek the sweet thoughts that translate themselves into blushes.
      Then&mdash;then, oh, then&mdash;she may forget that I am the peasant&rsquo;s
      son!.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Nay, if she will but hear thee talk, Claude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. I foresee it all. She will tell me that desert is the true rank. She
      will give me a badge&mdash;a flower&mdash;a glove! Oh rapture! I shall
      join the armies of the republic&mdash;I shall rise&mdash;I shall win a
      name that beauty will not blush to hear. I shall return with the right to
      say to her&mdash;&ldquo;See, how love does not level the proud, but raise the&mdash;humble!&rdquo;
       Oh, how my heart swells within me!&mdash;Oh, what glorious prophets of the
      future are youth and hope!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Knock at the door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter GASPAR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Welcome, Gaspar, welcome. Where is the letter? Why do you turn away,
      man? where is the letter? [GASPAR gives him one.] This! This is mine, the
      one I intrusted to thee. Didst thou not leave it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. Yes, I left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. My own verses returned to me. Nothing else!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. Thou wilt be proud to hear how thy messenger was honored. For thy
      sake, Melnotte, I have borne that which no Frenchman can bear without
      disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Disgrace, Gaspar! Disgrace?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. I gave thy letter to the porter, who passed it from lackey to
      lackey till it reached the lady it was meant for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. It reached her, then; you are sure of that! It reached her,&mdash;well,
      well!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. It reached her, and was returned to me with blows. Dost hear,
      Melnotte? with blows! Death! are we slaves still, that we are to be thus
      dealt with, we peasants?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. With blows? No, Gaspar, no; not blows!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. I could show thee the marks if it were not so deep a shame to bear
      them. The lackey who tossed thy letter into the mire swore that his lady
      and her mother never were so insulted. What could thy letter contain,
      Claude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [looking over the letter]. Not a line that a serf might not have
      written to an empress. No, not one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. They promise thee the same greeting they gave me, if thou wilt
      pass that way. Shall we endure this, Claude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [wringing GASPAR&rsquo;s hand]. Forgive me, the fault was mine, I have
      brought this on thee; I will not forget it; thou shalt be avenged! The
      heartless insolence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. Thou art moved, Melnotte; think not of me; I would go through fire
      and water to serve thee; but,&mdash;a blow! It is not the bruise that
      galls,&mdash;it is the blush, Melnotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Say, what message?&mdash;How insulted!&mdash;Wherefore?&mdash;What
      the offence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. Did you not write to Pauline Deschappelles, the daughter of the
      rich merchant?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaspar. And are you not a peasant&mdash;a gardener&rsquo;s son?&mdash;that was
      the offence. Sleep on it, Melnotte. Blows to a French citizen, blows!
      [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Now you are cured, Claude!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. tearing the letter. So do I scatter her image to the winds&mdash;I
      will stop her in the open streets&mdash;I will insult her&mdash;I will
      beat her menial ruffians&mdash;I will&mdash;[Turns suddenly to Widow.]
      Mother, am I humpbacked&mdash;deformed&mdash;hideous? Widow. You!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. A coward&mdash;a thief&mdash;a liar?
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. You!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Or a dull fool&mdash;a vain, drivelling, brainless idiot? Widow. No,
      no. Mel. What am I then&mdash;worse than all these? Why, I am a peasant!
      What has a peasant to do with love? Vain revolutions, why lavish your
      cruelty on the great? Oh that we&mdash;we, the hewers of wood and drawers
      of water&mdash;had been swept away, so that the proud might learn what the
      world would be without us! [Knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter Servant from the Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Servant. A letter for Citizen Melnotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. A letter! from her perhaps&mdash;who sent thee?
    </p>
    <p>
      Servant. Why, Monsieur&mdash;I mean Citizen&mdash;Beauseant, who stops to
      dine at the Golden Lion, on his way to his chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Beauseant!&mdash;[Reads].
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man, I know thy secret&mdash;thou lovest above thy station: if thou
      hast wit, courage, and discretion, I can secure to thee the realization of
      thy most sanguine hopes; and the sole condition I ask in return is, that
      thou shalt be steadfast to thine own ends. I shall demand from thee a
      solemn oath to marry her whom thou lovest; to bear her to thine home on
      thy wedding night. I am serious&mdash;if thou wouldst learn more, lose not
      a moment, but follow the bearer of this letter to thy friend and patron,&mdash;CHARLES
      BEAUSEANT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Can I believe my eyes? Are our own passions the sorcerers that raise
      up for us spirits of good or evil? I will go instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. What is this, Claude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. &ldquo;Marry her whom thou lovest,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;bear her to thine own home.&rdquo;&mdash;
      Oh, revenge and love; which of you is the stronger?&mdash;[Gazing on the
      picture.] Sweet face, thou smilest on me from the canvas: weak fool that I
      am, do I then love her still? No, it is the vision of my own romance that
      I have worshipped: it is the reality to which I bring scorn for scorn.
      Adieu, mother: I will return anon. My brain reels&mdash;the earth swims
      before me.&mdash;[Looks again at the letter.] No, it is not a mockery; I
      do not dream! [Exit.

    <h2>
      ACT II.&mdash;SCENE I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Gardens of M. DESCHAPPELLEs&rsquo; house at Lyons&mdash;the house seen at
      the back of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Well, what think you of my plot? Has it not succeeded to a miracle?
      The instant that I introduced his Highness the Prince of Como to the
      pompous mother and the scornful daughter, it was all over with them: he
      came&mdash;he saw&mdash;he conquered: and, though it is not many days
      since he arrived, they have already promised him the hand of Pauline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. It is lucky, though, that you told them his highness travelled
      incognito, for fear the Directory (who are not very fond of princes)
      should lay him by the heels; for he has a wonderful wish to keep up his
      rank, and scatters our gold about with as much coolness as if he were
      watering his own flower-pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. True, he is damnably extravagant; I think the sly dog does it out of
      malice. How ever, it must be owned that he reflects credit on his loyal
      subjects, and makes a very pretty figure in his fine clothes, with my
      diamond snuff-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. And my diamond ring! But do you think he will be firm to the last? I
      fancy I see symptoms of relenting: he will never keep up his rank, if he
      once let out his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. His oath binds him! he cannot retract without being foresworn, and
      those low fellows are always superstitious! But, as it is, I tremble lest
      he be discovered: that bluff Colonel Damas (Madame Deschappelles&rsquo; cousin)
      evidently suspects him: we must make haste and conclude the farce: I have
      thought of a plan to end it this very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. This very day! Poor Pauline: her dream will be soon over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Yes, this day they shall be married; this evening, according to his
      oath, he shall carry his bride to the Golden Lion, and then pomp,
      equipage, retinue, and title, all shall vanish at once; and her Highness
      the Princess shall find that she has refused the son of a Marquis, to
      marry the son of a gardener.&mdash;Oh, Pauline! once loved, now hated, yet
      still not relinquished, thou shalt drain the cup to the dregs,&mdash;thou
      shalt know what it is to be humbled!

      Enter from the house, MELNOTTE, as the Prince of Como, leading in PAULINE;
      MADAME

    <p>
      DESCHAPPELLES, fanning herself; and COLONEL DAMAS.

      [BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS bow respectfully, fully. PAULINE and MELNOTTE walk
      apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Good morning, gentlemen; really I am so fatigued with
      laughter; the dear Prince is so entertaining. What wit he has! Any one may
      see that he has spent his whole life in courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. And what the deuce do you know about courts, cousin Deschappelles?
      You women regard men just as you buy books&mdash;you never care about what
      is in them, but how they are bound and lettered. &lsquo;Sdeath, I don&rsquo;t think
      you would even look at your Bible if it had not a title to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. How coarse you are, cousin Damas!&mdash;quite the manners of
      a barrack&mdash;you don&rsquo;t deserve to be one of our family; really we must
      drop your acquaintance when Pauline marries. I cannot patronize any
      relations that would discredit my future son-in-law, the Prince of Como.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [advancing]. These are beautiful gardens, madame, [BEAUSEANT and
      GLAVIS retire]&mdash;who planned them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. A gardener named Melnotte, your highness&mdash;an honest man
      who knew his station. I can&rsquo;t say as much for his son&mdash;a presuming
      fellow, who,&mdash;ha! ha! actually wrote verses&mdash;such doggerel!&mdash;to
      my daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Yes, how you would have laughed at them, Prince! you, who write
      such beautiful verses!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. This Melnotte must be a monstrous impudent person!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Is he good-looking?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. I never notice such canaille&mdash;an ugly, mean-looking
      clown, if I remember right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Yet I heard your porter say he was wonderfully like his highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [taking snuff]. You are complimentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. For shame, cousin Damas!&mdash;like the Prince, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Like you! Ah, mother, like our beautiful prince! I&rsquo;ll never speak
      to you again, cousin Damas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [aside]. Humph!&mdash;rank is a great beautifier! I never passed for
      an Apollo while I was a peasant; if I am so handsome as a prince, what
      should I be as an emperor! [Aloud.] Monsieur Beauseant, will you honor me?
      [Offers snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. No, your highness; I have no small vices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Nay, if it were a vice, you&rsquo;d be sure to have it, Monsieur Beauseant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Ha! ha!&mdash;how very severe!&mdash;what wit!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [in a rage and aside]. Curse his impertinence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. What a superb snuff-box! Pauline. And what a beautiful ring!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. You like the box&mdash;a trifle&mdash;interesting perhaps from
      associations&mdash; a present from Louis XIV. to my great-great
      grandmother. Honor me by&mdash;accepting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. plucking him by the sleeve. How!&mdash;what the devil! My box&mdash;are
      you mad? It is worth five hundred louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [unheeding him, and turning to PAULINE]. And you like this ring? Ah,
      it has, indeed a lustre since your eyes have shone on it placing it on her
      finger. Henceforth hold me, sweet enchantress, the Slave of the Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. [pulling him]. Stay, stay&mdash;what are you about? My maiden aunt&rsquo;s
      legacy&mdash;a diamond of the first water. You shall be hanged for
      swindling, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [pretending not to hear]. It is curious, this ring; it is the one
      with which my grandfather, the Doge of Venice, married the Adriatic!
    </p>
    <p>
      (Madame and PAULINE examine the ring.) Mel. [to BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS].
      Fie, gentlemen! princes must be generous?&mdash;[Turns to DAMAS, who
      watches them closely.] These kind friends have my interest so much at
      heart, that they are as careful of my property as if it were their own!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau and Gla. [confusedly]. Ha! ha!&mdash;very good joke that!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Appears to remonstrate with MELNOTTE in dumb show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. What&rsquo;s all that whispering? I am sure there is some juggle here:
      hang me, if I think he is an Italian after all. Gad, I&rsquo;ll try him.
      Servitore umillissimo, Eccellenza.* (* Your Excellency&rsquo;s most humble
      servant.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Hum&mdash;what does he mean, I wonder?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Godo di vedervi in buona salute.* (* I am glad to see you in good
      health.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Hem&mdash;hem!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Fa bel tempo&mdash;the si dice di nuovo? * (* Fine weather. What
      news is there?)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Well, sir, what&rsquo;s all that gibberish?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Oh, oh!&mdash;only Italian, your highness!&mdash;The Prince of Como
      does not understand his own language!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Not as you pronounce it; who the deuce could?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Ha! ha! cousin Damas, never pretend to what you don&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Ha! ha! cousin Damas; you speak Italian, indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      [Makes a mocking gesture at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [to GLAVIS]. Clever dog!&mdash;how ready!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Ready, yes; with my diamond ring!&mdash;Damn his readiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Laugh at me!&mdash;laugh at a Colonel in the French army!&mdash;the
      fellow&rsquo;s an impostor; I know he is. I&rsquo;ll see if he understands fighting as
      well as he does Italian.&mdash;[Goes up to him, and aside.] Sir, you are a
      jackanapes.&mdash;Can you construe that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. No, sir; I never construe affronts in the presence of ladies;
      by-and-by I shall be happy to take a lesson&mdash;or give one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. I&rsquo;ll find the occasion, never fear!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Where are you going, cousin?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. To correct my Italian. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [to GLAVIS]. Let us after, and pacify him; he evidently suspects
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Yes!&mdash;but my diamond ring!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. And my box!&mdash;We are over-taxed fellow-subjects!&mdash;we must
      stop the supplies, and dethrone the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Prince!&mdash;he ought to be heir-apparent to King Stork.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exeunt BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Dare I ask your highness to forgive my cousin&rsquo;s insufferable
      vulgarity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Oh yes!&mdash;you will forgive his manner for the sake of his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. And the sake of his cousin.&mdash;Ah, madam, there is one comfort in
      rank,&mdash;we are so sure of our position that we are not easily
      affronted. Besides, M. Damas has bought the right of indulgence from his
      friends, by never showing it to his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Ah! he is, indeed, as brave in action as he is rude in speech. He
      rose from the ranks to his present grade, and in two years!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. In two years!&mdash;two years, did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. [aside]. I don&rsquo;t like leaving girls alone with their lovers;
      but, with a prince, it would be so ill-bred to be prudish. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. You can be proud of your connection with one who owes his position to
      merit&mdash;not birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Why, yes; but still
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Still what, Pauline!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. There is something glorious in the heritage of command. A man who
      has ancestors is like a representative of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. True; but, like other representatives, nine times out of ten he is a
      silent member. Ah, Pauline! not to the past, but to the future, looks true
      nobility, and finds its blazon in posterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. You say this to please me, who have no ancestors; but you,
      prince, must be proud of so illustrious a race!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. No, no! I would not, were I fifty times a prince, be a pensioner on
      the dead! I honor birth and ancestry when they are regarded as the
      incentives to exertion, not the titledeeds to sloth! I honor the laurels
      that overshadow the graves of our fathers; it is our fathers I emulate,
      when I desire that beneath the evergreen I myself have planted, my own
      ashes may repose! Dearest! couldst thou but see with my eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. I cannot forego pride when I look on thee, and think that thou
      lovest me. Sweet Prince, tell me again of thy palace by the Lake of Como;
      it is so pleasant to hear of thy splendors since thou didst swear to me
      that they would be desolate without Pauline; and when thou describest
      them, it is with a mocking lip and a noble scorn, as if custom had made
      thee disdain greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Nay, dearest, nay, if thou wouldst have me paint The home to which,
      could love fulfil its prayers, This hand would lead thee, listen!*&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (* The reader will observe that Melnotte evades the request
     of Pauline. He proceeds to describe a home, which he does
     not say he possesses, but to which he would lead her, &ldquo;could
     Love fulfil its prayers.&rdquo; This caution is intended as a
     reply to a sagacious critic who censures the description,
     because it is not an exact and prosaic inventory of the
     characteristics of the Lake of Como!&mdash;When Melnotte, for
     instance, talks of birds &ldquo;that syllable the name of Pauline&rdquo;
      (by the way, a literal translation from an Italian poet), he
     is not thinking of ornithology, but probably of the Arabian
     Nights.  He is venting the extravagant, but natural,
     enthusiasm of the poet and the lover.)

     A deep vale
     Shut out by Alphine hills from the rude world;
     Near a clear lake, margin&rsquo;d by fruits of gold
     And whispering myrtles; glassing softest skies,
     As cloudless, save with rare and roseate shadows,
     As I would have thy fate!

     Pauline. My own dear love!

     Mel. A palace lifting to eternal summer
     Its marble walls, from out a glossy bower
     Of coolest foliage musical with birds,
     Whose songs should syllable thy name! At noon
     We&rsquo;d sit beneath the arching vines, and wonder
     Why Earth could be unhappy, while the Heavens
     Still left us youth and love! We&rsquo;d have no friends
     That were not lovers; no ambition, save
     To excel them all in love; we&rsquo;d read no books
     That were not tales of love&mdash;that we might smile
     To think how poorly eloquence of words
     Translates the poetry of hearts like ours!
     And when night came, amidst the breathless Heavens
     We&rsquo;d guess what star should be our home when love
     Becomes immortal; while the perfumed light
     Stole through the mists of alabaster lamps,
     And every air was heavy with the sighs
     Of orange-groves and music from sweet lutes,
     And murmurs of low fountains that gush forth
     I&rsquo; the midst of roses!&mdash;Dost thou like the picture?

     Pauline. Oh, as the bee upon the flower, I hang
     Upon the honey of thy eloquent tongue!
     Am I not blest? And if I love too wildly,
     Who would not love thee like Pauline?

     Mel. [bitterly.] Oh, false one!
     It is the prince thou lovest, not the man
     If in the stead of luxury, pomp, and power,
     I had painted poverty, and toil, and care,
     Thou hadst found no honey on my tongue;&mdash;Pauline,
     That is not love!

     Pauline. Thou wrong&rsquo;st me, cruel Prince!
     At first, in truth, I might not have been won,
     Save through the weakness of a flatter&rsquo;d pride;
     But now,&mdash;oh! trust me,&mdash;couldst thou fall from power
     And sink&mdash;

     Mel. As low as that poor gardener&rsquo;s son
     Who dared to lift his eyes to thee?&mdash;

     Pauline. Even then,
     Methinks thou wouldst be only made more dear
     By the sweet thought that I could prove how deep
     Is woman&rsquo;s love! We are like the insects, caught
     By the poor glittering of a garish flame;
     But, oh, the wings once scorch&rsquo;d, the brightest star
     Lures us no more; and by the fatal light
     We cling till death!

     Mel. Angel! [Aside.] O conscience! conscience!
     It must not be; her love hath grown a torture
     Worse than her hate. I will at once to Beauseant,
     And&mdash;ha! he comes. Sweet love, one moment leave me.
     I have business with these gentlemen&mdash;I&mdash;I
     Will forwith join you.
</pre>
    <p>
      Pauline. Do not tarry long! [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Release me from my oath,&mdash;I will not marry her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau Then thou art perjured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. No, I was not in my senses when I swore to thee to marry her! I was
      blind to all but her scorn!&mdash;deaf to all but my passion and my rage!
      Give me back my poverty and my honor!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. It is too late,&mdash;you must marry her! and this day. I have a
      story already coined, and sure to pass current. This Damas suspects thee,&mdash;he
      will set the police to work!&mdash;thou wilt be detected&mdash;Pauline
      will despise and execrate thee. Thou wilt be sent to the common gaol as a
      swindler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Fiend!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. And in the heat of the girl&rsquo;s resentment (you know of what
      resentment is capable) and the parents&rsquo; shame, she will be induced to
      marry the first that offers&mdash;even perhaps your humble servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. You! No; that were worse&mdash;for thou hast no mercy! I will marry
      her.&mdash;I will keep my oath. Quick, then, with the damnable invention
      thou art hatching;&mdash;quick, if thou wouldst not have me strangle thee
      or myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. What a tiger! Too fierce for a prince; he ought to have been the
      Grand Turk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Enough&mdash;I will dispatch; be prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Exeunt BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter DAMAS with two swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Now, then, sir, the ladies are no longer your excuse. I have
      brought you a couple of dictionaries; let us see if your highness can find
      out the Latin for bilbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Away, sir! I am in no humor for jesting. Damas. I see you understand
      something of the grammar; you decline the non-substantive &ldquo;small-swords&rdquo;
       with great ease; but that won&rsquo;t do&mdash;you must take a lesson in
      parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Fool! Damas. Sir, as sons take after their mother, so the man who
      calls me a fool insults the lady who bore me; there&rsquo;s no escape for you&mdash;fight
      you shall, or&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Oh, enough! enough!&mdash;take your ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fight; DAMAS is disarmed. MELNOTTE takes up the sword and returns it
      to DAMAS respectfully. A just punishment to the brave soldier who robs the
      state of its best property&mdash;the sole right to his valor and his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Sir, you fence exceedingly well; you must be a man of honor&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t care a jot whether you are a prince; but a man who has carte and
      tierce at his fingers&rsquo; ends must be a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [aside.] Gentleman! Ay, I was a gentleman before I turned
      conspirator; for honest men are the gentlemen of Nature! Colonel, they
      tell me you rose from the ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. And in two years!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. It is true; that&rsquo;s no wonder in our army at present. Why the oldest
      general in the service is scarcely thirty, and we have some of
      two-and-twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Two-and-twenty!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Yes; in the French army, now a days, promotion is not a matter of
      purchase. We are all heroes, because we may be all generals. We have no
      fear of the cypress, because we may all hope for the laurel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. A general at two-and-twenty! [turning away]&mdash;Sir, I may ask you
      a favor one of these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Sir, I shall be proud to grant it. It is astonishing how much I
      like a man after I&rsquo;ve fought with him. [Hides the swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter MADAME DESCHAPPELLES and BEAUSEANT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Oh, prince,&mdash;prince!&mdash;What do I hear? You must fly&mdash;you
      must quit us!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. I!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Yes, prince: read this letter, just received from my friend at
      Paris, one of the Directory; they suspect you of designs against the
      Republic: they are very suspicious of princes, and your family take part
      with the Austrians. Knowing that I introduced your highness at Lyons, my
      friend writes to me to say that you must quit the town immediately, or you
      will be arrested,&mdash;thrown into prison, perhaps guillotined! Fly!&mdash;I
      will order horses to your carriage instantly. Fly to Marsailles; there you
      can take ship to Leghorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. And what&rsquo;s to become of Pauline? Am I not to be mother to a
      princess, after all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter PAULINE and MONSIEUR DESCHAPPELLES.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline [throwing herself into MELNOTTE&rsquo;s arms.] You must leave us!&mdash;Leave
      Pauline!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Not a moment is to be wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. I will go to the magistrates and inquire&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Then he is lost; the magistrates, hearing he is suspected, will
      order his arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. And I shall not be a princess-dowager!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Why not? There is only one thing to be done:&mdash;send for the
      priest&mdash;let the marriage take place at once, and the prince carry
      home a bride?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Impossible!&mdash;[Aside.] Villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. What, lose my child?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. And gain a princess!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme Deschap. Oh, Monsieur Beauseant, you are so very kind, it must be so,&mdash;we
      ought not to be selfish, my daughter&rsquo;s happiness at stake. She will go
      away, too, in a carriage and six!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Thou art here still,&mdash;I cannot part from my heart will
      break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. But thou wilt not consent to this hasty union?&mdash;thou wilt not
      wed an outcast&mdash;a fugitive?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Ah! if thou art in danger, who should share it but Pauline?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [aside]. Distraction!&mdash;If the earth could swallow me!
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Gently! gently! The settlements&mdash;the contracts&mdash;my
      daughter&rsquo;s dowry!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. The dowry!&mdash;I am not base enough for that; no, not one farthing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [to MADAM]. Noble fellow!&mdash;Really your good husband is too
      mercantile in these matters. Monsieur Deschappelles, you hear his
      highness: we can arrange the settlements by proxy; &lsquo;tis the way with
      people of quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. But&mdash;

    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Hold your tongue!&mdash;Don&rsquo;t expose yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. I will bring the priest in a trice. Go in all of you and prepare;
      the carriage shall be at the door before the ceremony is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Be sure there are six horses, Beauseant! You are very good
      to have forgiven us for refusing you; but you see&mdash;a prince!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. And such a prince! Madam, I cannot blush at the success of so
      illustrious a rival.&mdash;[Aside.] Now will I follow them to the village,
      enjoy my triumph, and to-morrow, in the hour of thy shame and grief, I
      think, proud girl, thou wilt prefer even these arms to those of the
      gardener&rsquo;s son. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Come, Monsieur Deschappelles, give your arm to her highness
      that is to be.

    <p>
      M. Deschap. I don&rsquo;t like doing business in such a hurry; &lsquo;tis not the way
      with the house of Deschappelles &amp; Co.

      Mme. Deschap. There, now, you fancy you are in the counting-house, don&rsquo;t
      you?

      Speak&mdash;it is not yet too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. When I loved thee, thy fate became mine. Triumph or danger&mdash;
      joy or sorrow&mdash;I am by thy side.

    <p>
      Damas. Well, well, prince, thou art a lucky man to be so loved. She is a
      good little girl in spite of her foibles make her as happy as if she were
      not to be a princess [slapping him on the shoulder]. Come, sir, I wish you
      joy&mdash;young tender&mdash;lovely;&mdash;zounds, I envy you!

    <p>
      Enter Landlord and his Daughter from the Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha! Well, I never shall get over it. Our Claude is
      a prince with a vengeance now. His carriage breaks down at my inn&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      Janet. And what airs the young lady gives herself! &ldquo;Is this the best room
      you have, young woman?&rdquo; with such a toss of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land. Well, get in, Janet: get in and see to the supper: the servants must
      sup before they go back. [Exeunt.

      Enter BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. You see our princess is lodged at last&mdash;one stage more, and
      she&rsquo;ll be at her journey&rsquo;s end&mdash;the beautiful palace at the foot of
      the Alps!&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. Faith, I pity the poor Pauline&mdash;especially if she&rsquo;s going to sup
      at the Golden Lion [makes a wry face]. I shall never forget that cursed
      ragout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter MELNOTTE from the Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Your servant, my prince; you reigned most worthily, I condole with
      you on your abdication. I am afraid that your highness&rsquo;s retinue are not
      very faithful servants. I think they will quit you in the moment of your
      fall &lsquo;tis the fate of greatness. But you are welcome to your fine clothes&mdash;also
      the diamond snuff-box, which Louis XIV. gave to your
      great-great-grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. And the ring, with which your grandfather the Dodge of Venice married
      the Adriatic.

    <p>
      Mel. I have kept my oath, gentlemen&mdash;say, have I kept my oath?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Most religiously.

    <p>
      Mel. Then you have done with me and mine&mdash;away with you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. How, knave?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Look you, our bond is over. Proud conquerors that we are, we have won
      the victory over a simple girl compromised her honor&mdash;embittered her
      life&mdash;blasted, in their very blossoms, all the flowers of her youth.
      This is your triumph,&mdash;it is my shame! [Turns to BEAUSEANT.] Enjoy
      thy triumph, but not in my sight. I was her betrayer&mdash;I am her
      protector! Cross but her path&mdash;one word of scorn, one look of insult&mdash;nay,
      but one quiver of that mocking lip, and I will teach thee that bitter word
      thou hast graven eternally in this heart&mdash;Repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. His highness is most grandiloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Highness me no more! Beware! Remorse has made me a new being. Away
      with you! There is danger in me. Away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gla. [aside]. He&rsquo;s an awkward fellow to deal with: come away, Beauseant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. I know the respect clue to rank. Adieu, my prince. Any commands at
      Lyons? Yet hold&mdash;I promised you 200 Louis on your wedding-day; here
      they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [dashing the purse to the ground]. I gave you revenge, I did not sell
      it. Take up your silver, Judas; take it. Ay, it is fit you should learn to
      stoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. You will beg my pardon for this some clay. [Aside to GLAVIS.] Come
      to my chateau&mdash;I shall return hither to morrow, to learn how Pauline
      likes her new dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Are you not gone yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Your highness&rsquo;s most obedient, most faithful

    <p>
      Gla. And most humble servants. Ha! ha! [Exeunt BEAUSEANT and GLAVIS.

      Mel. Thank heaven I had no weapon, or I should have slain them. Wretch!
      what can I say? Where turn? On all sides mockery&mdash;the very boors
      within&mdash;[Laughter from the Inn].&mdash;&lsquo;Sdeath, if even in this short
      absence the exposure should have chanced. I will call her. We will go
      hence. I have already sent one I can trust to my mother&rsquo;s house. There, at
      least, none can insult her agony&mdash;gloat upon her shame! There alone
      must she learn what a villain she has sworn to love. [As he turns to the
      door enter PAULINE from the Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Ah! my lord, what a place! I never saw such rude people. They
      stare and wink so. I think the very sight of a prince, though he travels
      incognito, turns their honest heads. What a pity the carriage should break
      down in such a spot! You are not well&mdash;the drops stand on your brow&mdash;your
      hand is feverish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Nay, it is but a passing spasm;&mdash;the air
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Is not the soft air of your native south&mdash;How pale he is!&mdash;indeed
      thou art not well. Where are our people? I will call them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Hold! I&mdash;I am well.

     And so they might, but thou art by my side,
     And I forget all else.

    <p>
      Enter Landlord, the Servants peeping and laughing over his shoulder.

    <p>
      Land. My lord&mdash;your highness&mdash;Will your most noble excellency
      choose&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Mel. Begone, sir! [Exit Landlord laughing.

     Pauline. How could they have learn&rsquo;d thy rank?
     One&rsquo;s servants are so vain!&mdash;nay, let it not
     Chafe thee, sweet prince!&mdash;a few short days and we
     Shall see thy palace by its lake of silver,
     And&mdash;nay, nay, spendthrift, is thy wealth of smiles,
     Already drain&rsquo;d, or dost thou play the miser?

     Mel. Thine eyes would call up smiles in deserts, fair one.
     Let us escape these rustics: close at hand
     There is a cot, where I have bid prepare
     Our evening lodgment&mdash;a rude, homely roof,
     But honest, where our welcome will not be
     Made torture by the vulgar eyes and tongues
     That are as death to Love! A heavenly night!
     The wooing air and the soft moon invite us.
     Wilt walk? I pray thee, now,&mdash;I know the path,
     Ay, every inch of it!

     Pauline. What, thou! Methought
     Thou wert a stranger in these parts? Ah, truant,
     Some village beauty lured thee;&mdash;thou art now
     Grown constant?
</pre>
    <p>
      Mel. Trust me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Princes are so changeful!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Come, dearest, come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Shall I not call our people To light us?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Heaven will lend its stars for torches! It is not far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. The night breeze chills me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Nay, Let me thus mantle thee;&mdash;it is not cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Never beneath thy smile!

    <p>
      Mel. [aside.] O Heaven! forgive me! [Exeunt

      SCENE II.

    <p>
      MELNOTTE&rsquo;S cottage&mdash;Widow bustling about&mdash;a table spread for
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. So, I think that looks very neat. He sent me a line, so blotted
      that I can scarcely read it, to say he would be here almost immediately.
      She must have loved him well indeed to have forgotten his birth; for
      though he was introduced to her in disguise, he is too honorable not to
      have revealed to her the artifice, which her love only could forgive.
      Well, I do not wonder at it; for though my son is not a prince, he ought
      to be one, and that&rsquo;s almost as good, [Knock at the door.] Ah! here they
      are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter MELNOTTE and PAULINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Oh, my boy&mdash;the pride of my heart!&mdash;welcome, welcome! I
      beg pardon, ma&rsquo;am, but I do love him so!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Good woman, I really&mdash;why prince, what is this?&mdash;does
      the old lady know you? Oh, I guess, you have done her some service.
      Another proof of your kind heart? is it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Of my kind heart, ay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. So you know the prince?
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Know him, madam?&mdash;Ah, I begin to fear it is you who know him
      not!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Do you think she is mad? Can we stay here, my lord? I think
      there&rsquo;s something very wild about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Madam, I&mdash;no, I cannot tell her; my knees knock together: what a
      coward is a man who has lost his honor! Speak to her&mdash;speak to her
      [to his mother]&mdash;tell her that&mdash;O Heaven, that I were dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. How confused he looks!&mdash;this strange place?&mdash;this woman&mdash;what
      can it mean?&mdash;I half suspect&mdash;Who are you, madam!&mdash;who are
      you! can&rsquo;t you speak? are you struck dumb?
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Claude, you have not deceived her?&mdash;Ah, shame upon you! I
      thought that, before you went to the altar, she was to have known all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. All! what!&mdash;My blood freezes in my veins!
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Poor lady!&mdash;dare I tell her, Claude? [MELNOTTE makes a sign of
      assent.] Know you not then, madam, that this young man is of poor though
      honest parents? Know you not that you are wedded to my son, Claude
      Melnotte?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Your son! hold&mdash;hold! do not speak to me.&mdash;[Approaches
      MELNOTTE, and lays her hand on his arm.]&mdash;Is this a jest? is it? I
      know it is, only speak&mdash;one word&mdash;one look one smile. I cannot
      believe&mdash;I who loved thee so&mdash;I cannot believe that thou art
      such a&mdash;No, I will not wrong thee by a harsh word&mdash;Speak!
    </p>

      Mel. Leave us&mdash;have pity on her, on me: leave us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Oh, Claude, that I should live to see thee bowed by shame! thee of
      whom I was so proud! [Exit by the staircase.

    <p>
      Pauline. Her son&mdash;her son!

      Mel. Now, lady, hear me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Hear thee! Ay, speak&mdash;her son! have fiends a parent? speak,
      That thou mayst silence curses&mdash;speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. No, curse me: Thy curse would blast me less than thy forgiveness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Pauline [laughing wildly].
     &ldquo;This is thy palace, where the perfumed light
     Steals through the mist of alabaster lamps,
     And every air is heavy with the sighs
     Of orange-groves, and music from the sweet lutes,
     And murmurs of low fountains, that gush forth
     I&rsquo; the midst of roses!&rdquo; Dost thou like the picture?
     This is my bridal home, and thou my bridegroom.
     O fool&mdash;O dupe&mdash;O wretch!&mdash;I see it all
     Thy by-word and the jeer of every tongue
     In Lyons. Hast thou in thy heart one touch
     Of human kindness? if thou hast, why, kill me,
     And save thy wife from madness. No, it cannot
     It cannot be: this is some horrid dream:
     I shall wake soon.&mdash;[Touching him.] Art flesh art man? or but
     The shadows seen in sleep? It is too real.
     What have I done to thee? how sinn&rsquo;d against thee,
     That thou shouldst crush me thus?

     Mel. Pauline, by pride
     Angels have fallen ere thy time: by pride
     That sole alloy of thy most lovely mould
     The evil spirit of a bitter love,
     And a revengeful heart, had power upon thee.
     From my first years my soul was fill&rsquo;d with thee:
     I saw thee midst the flow&rsquo;rs the lowly boy
     Tended, unmark&rsquo;d by thee&mdash;a spirit of bloom,
     And joy, and freshness, as if Spring itself
     Were made a living thing, and wore thy shape!
     I saw thee, and the passionate heart of man
     Enter&rsquo;d the breast of the wild-dreaming boy.
     And from that hour I grew&mdash;what to the last
     I shall be&mdash;thine adorer! Well, this love
     Vain, frantic, guilty, if thou wilt, became
     A fountain of ambition and bright hope;
     I thought of tales that by the winter hearth
     Old gossips tell&mdash;how maidens sprung from kings
     Have stoop&rsquo;d from their high sphere; how love, like death
     Levels all ranks, and lays the shepherd&rsquo;s crook
     Beside the sceptre. Thus I made my home
     In the soft palace of a fairy Future!
     My father died; and I, the peasant-born,
     Was my own lord. Then did I seek to rise
     Out of the prison of my mean estate;
     And, with such jewels as the exploring mind
     Brings from the caves of knowledge, buy my ransom
     From those twin gaolers of the daring heart
     Low birth and iron fortune. Thy bright image
     Glass&rsquo;d in my soul, took all the hues of glory,
     And lured me on to those inspiring toils
     By which man masters men! For thee I grew
     A midnight student o&rsquo;er the dreams of sages.
     For thee I sought to borrow from each grace,
     And every muse, such attributes as lend
     Ideal charms to love. I thought of thee,
     And passion taught me poesy&mdash;of thee,
     And on the painter&rsquo;s canvas grew the life
     Of beauty! Art became the shadow
     Of the dear starlight of thy haunting eyes
     Men call&rsquo;d me vain&mdash;some mad&mdash;I heeded not;
     But still toil&rsquo;d on&mdash;hoped on&mdash;for it was sweet,
     If not to win, to feel more worthy thee?

     Pauline. Has he a magic to exorcise hate!

     Mel. At last, in one mad hour, I dared to pour
     The thoughts that burst their channels into song,
     And sent them to thee&mdash;such a tribute, lady,
     As beauty rarely scorns, even from the meanest.
     The name&mdash;appended by the burning heart
     That long&rsquo;d to show its idol what bright things
     It had created&mdash;yea, the enthusiast&rsquo;s name,
     That should have been thy triumph, was thy scorn!
     That very hour&mdash;when passion, turn&rsquo;d to wrath,
     Resembled hatred most&mdash;when thy disdain
     Made my whole soul a chaos&mdash;in that hour
     The tempters found me a revengeful tool
     For their revenge! Thou hadst trampled on the worm
     It turn&rsquo;d and stung thee!

     Pauline. Love, sir, hath no sting.
     What was the slight of a poor powerless girl
     To the deep wrong of this most vile revenge?
     Oh, how I loved this man!&mdash;a serf!&mdash;a slave!

     Mel. Hold, lady! No, not slave! Despair is free!
     I will not tell thee of the throes&mdash;the struggles
     The anguish&mdash;the remorse: No, let it pass!
     And let me come to such most poor atonement
     Yet in my power. Pauline!

     [Approaching her with great emotion, and about to take her hand.

     Pauline. No, touch me not!
     I know my fate. You are, by law, my tyrant;
     And I&mdash;O Heaven!&mdash;a peasant&rsquo;s wife! I&rsquo;ll work
     Toil&mdash;drudge&mdash;do what thou wilt&mdash;but touch me not;
     Let my wrongs make me sacred!

     Mel. Do not fear me.
     Thou dost not know me, madam: at the altar
     My vengeance ceased&mdash;my guilty oath expired!
     Henceforth, no image of some marble saint,
     Niched in cathedral aisles, is hallow&rsquo;d more
     From the rude hand of sacrilegious wrong.
     I am thy husband&mdash;nay, thou need&rsquo;st not shudder;
     Here, at thy feet, I lay a husband&rsquo;s rights.
     A marriage thus unholy&mdash;unfulfill&rsquo;d&mdash;
     A bond of fraud&mdash;is, by the laws of France,
     Made void and null. To-night sleep&mdash;sleep in peace.
     To-morrow, pure and virgin as this morn
     I bore thee, bathed in blushes, from the shrine,
     Thy father&rsquo;s arms shall take thee to thy home.
     The law shall do thee justice, and restore
     Thy right to bless another with thy love.
     And when thou art happy, and hast half forgot
     Him who so loved&mdash;so wrong&rsquo;d thee, think at least
     Heaven left some remnant of the angel still
     In that poor peasant&rsquo;s nature!

     Ho! my mother! [Enter Widow.

     Conduct this lady&mdash;(she is not my wife;
     She is our guest,&mdash;our honor&rsquo;d guest, my mother)&mdash;
     To the poor chamber, where the sleep of virtue,
     Never, beneath my father&rsquo;s honest roof,
     Ev&rsquo;n villains dared to mar! Now, lady, now,

    <p>
      The cottage as before&mdash;MELNOTTE seated before a table&mdash;writing
      implements, etc.&mdash;(Day breaking.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Hush, hush!&mdash;she sleeps at last!&mdash;thank Heaven, for a while
      she forgets even that I live! Her sobs, which have gone to my heart the
      whole, long, desolate night, have ceased!&mdash;all calm&mdash;all still!
      I will go now; I will send this letter to Pauline&rsquo;s father: when he
      arrives, I will place in his hands my own consent to the divorce, and
      then, O France! my country! accept among thy protectors, thy defenders&mdash;the
      peasant&rsquo;s Son! Our country is less proud than custom, and does not refuse
      the blood, the heart, the right hand of the poor man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter Widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. My son, thou hast acted ill; but sin brings its own punishment. In
      the hour of thy remorse, it is not for a mother to reproach thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. What is past is past. There is a future left to all men, who have the
      virtue to repent, and the energy to atone. Thou shalt be proud of thy son
      yet. Meanwhile, remember this poor lady has been grievously injured. For
      the sake of thy son&rsquo;s conscience, respect, honor, bear with her. If she
      weep, console&mdash;if she chide, be silent. &lsquo;Tis but a little while more&mdash;I
      shall send an express fast as horse can speed to her father. Farewell! I
      shall return shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. It is the only course left to thee&mdash;thou wert led astray, but
      thou art not hardened. Thy heart is right still, as ever it was when, in
      thy most ambitious hopes thou wert never ashamed of thy poor mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Ashamed of thee; No, if I yet endure, yet live, yet hope,&mdash;it is
      only because I would not die till I have redeemed the noble heritage I
      have lost&mdash;the heritage I took unstained from thee and my dead father&mdash;a
      proud conscience and an honest name. I shall win them back yet&mdash;heaven
      bless you! [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. My dear Claude! How my heart bleeds for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      [PAULINE looks down from above, and after a pause descends
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Not here!&mdash;he spares me that pain at least: so far he is
      considerate&mdash;yet the place seems still more desolate without him. Oh,
      that I could hate him&mdash;the gardener&rsquo;s son!&mdash;and yet how nobly he&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no
      I will not be so mean a thing as to forgive him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Good morning, madam; I would have waited on you if I had known you
      were stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. It is no matter, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;your son&rsquo;s wife ought to wait on
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. My son&rsquo;s wife&mdash;let not that thought vex you, madam&mdash;he
      tells me that you will have your divorce. And I hope I shall live to see
      him smile again. There are maidens in this village, young and fair, madam,
      who may yet console him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. I dare say&mdash;they are very welcome&mdash;and when the divorce
      is got&mdash;he will marry again. I am sure I hope so. [Weeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. He could have married the richest girl in the province, if he had
      pleased it; but his head was turned, poor child! he could think of nothing
      but you. [Weeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Don&rsquo;t weep, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Ah, he has behaved very ill, I know, but love is so headstrong in
      the young. Don&rsquo;t weep, madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. So, as you were saying&mdash;go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Oh, I cannot excuse him, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;he was not in his right
      senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. But he always&mdash;always [sobbing] loved&mdash;loved me then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. He thought of nothing else. See here&mdash;he learnt to paint that
      he might take your likeness [uncovers the picture]. But that&rsquo;s all over
      now&mdash;I trust you have cured him of his folly;&mdash;but, dear heart,
      you have had no breakfast!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. I can&rsquo;t take anything&mdash;don&rsquo;t trouble yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Nay, madam, be persuaded; a little coffee will refresh you. Our
      milk and eggs are excellent. I will get out Claude&rsquo;s coffee-cup&mdash;It
      is of real Sevres; he saved up all his money to buy it three years ago,
      because the name of Pauline was inscribed on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Three years ago! Poor Claude!&mdash;Thank you; I think I will
      have some coffee. Oh! if he were but a poor gentleman, even a merchant:
      but a gardener&rsquo;s son&mdash;and what a home!&mdash;Oh no,&mdash;it is too
      dreadful!
    </p>
    <p>
      They seat themselves at the table, BEAUSEANT opens the lattice and looks
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. So&mdash;so&mdash;the coast is clear! I saw Claude in the lane&mdash;I
      shall have an excellent opportunity. [Shuts the lattice and knocks at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. [starting]. Can it be my father?&mdash;he has not sent for&mdash;him
      yet? No, he cannot be in such a hurry to get rid of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. It is not time for your father to arrive yet; it must be some
      neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Don&rsquo;t admit any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Widow opens the door, BEAUSEANT pushes her aside and enters. Ha! Heavens!
      that hateful Beauseant! This is indeed bitter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Good morning, madam! O widow, your son begs you will have the
      goodness to go to him in the village he wants to speak to you on
      particular business; you&rsquo;ll find him at the inn, or the grocer&rsquo;s shop, or
      the baker&rsquo;s, or at some other friend&rsquo;s of your family&mdash;make haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Don&rsquo;t leave me, mother!&mdash;don&rsquo;t leave me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [with great respect]. Be not alarmed, madam. Believe me your friend&mdash;your
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Sir, I have no fear of you, even in this house! Go, madam, if
      your son wishes it; I will not contradict his commands whilst, at least he
      has still the right to be obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. I don&rsquo;t understand this; however, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be long gone. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Sir, I divine the object of your visit&mdash;you wish to exult in
      the humiliation of one who humbled you. Be it so; I am prepared to endure
      all&mdash;even your presence!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. You mistake me, madam&mdash;Pauline, you mistake me! I come to lay
      my fortune at your feet. You must already be disenchanted with this
      impostor; these walls are not worthy to be hallowed by your beauty! Shall
      that form be clasped in the arms of a base-born peasant? Beloved,
      beautiful Pauline! fly with me&mdash;my carriage waits without&mdash;I
      will bear you to a home more meet for your reception. Wealth, luxury,
      station&mdash;all shall yet be yours. I forget your past disdain&mdash;I
      remember only your beauty and my unconquerable love!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Sir! leave this house&mdash;it is humble: but a husband&rsquo;s roof,
      however lowly, is, in the eyes of God and man, the temple of a wife&rsquo;s
      honor! Know that I would rather starve&mdash;yes&mdash;with him who has
      betrayed me, than accept your lawful hand, even were you the prince whose
      name he bore.&mdash;Go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. What! is not your pride humbled yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Sir, what was pride in prosperity in affliction becomes virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Look round: these rugged floors&mdash;these homely walls&mdash;this
      wretched struggle of poverty for comfort&mdash;think of this! and contrast
      with such a picture the refinement, the luxury, the pomp, that the
      wealthiest gentleman of Lyons offers to the loveliest lady. Ah, hear me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Oh! my father!&mdash;why did I leave you?&mdash;why am I thus
      friendless? Sir, you see before you a betrayed, injured, miserable woman!&mdash;respect
      her anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      [MELNOTTE opens the door silently, and pauses at the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. No! let me rather thus console it; let me snatch from those lips one
      breath of that fragrance which never should be wasted on the low churl thy
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Help! Claude!&mdash;Claude!&mdash;Have I no protector?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Be silent! [showing a pistol.] See, I do not come unprepared even
      for violence. I will brave all things&mdash;thy husband and all his race&mdash;
      for thy sake. Thus, then, I clasp thee!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. [dashing him to the other end of the stage]. Pauline&mdash;look up,
      Pauline! thou art safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [levelling his pistol]. Dare you thus insult a man of my birth,
      ruffian?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Oh, spare him&mdash;spare my husband!&mdash;Beauseant&mdash;Claude&mdash;no&mdash;no
      [faints].
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Miserable trickster! shame upon you! brave devices to terrify a
      woman! Coward!&mdash;you tremble&mdash;you have outraged the laws&mdash;you
      know that your weapon is harmless&mdash;you have the courage of the
      mountebank, not the bravo!&mdash;Pauline, there is no danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. I wish thou wert a gentleman&mdash;as it is, thou art beneath me.&mdash;
      Good day, and a happy honeymoon.&mdash;[Aside.] I will not die till I am
      avenged. [Exit.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Mel. I hold her in these arms&mdash;the last embrace
     Never, ah never more, shall this dear head
     Be pillow&rsquo;d on the heart that should have shelter&rsquo;d
     And has betray&rsquo;d!&mdash;Soft&mdash;soft! one kiss&mdash;poor wretch!
     No scorn on that pale lip forbids me now!
     One kiss&mdash;so ends all record of my crime!
     It is the seal upon the tomb of hope,
     By which, like some lost, sorrowing angel, sits
     Sad memory evermore; she breathes&mdash;she moves
     She wakes to scorn, to hate, but not to shudder
     Beneath the touch of my abhorred love.
     Places her on a seat. There&mdash;we are strangers now!

     Pauline. All gone&mdash;all calm
     Is every thing a dream? thou art safe, unhurt
     I do not love thee;&mdash;but&mdash;but I am woman,
     And&mdash;and&mdash;no blood is spilt?
</pre>
    <p>
      Mel. No, lady, no; My guilt hath not deserved so rich a blessing As even
      danger in thy cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter WIDOW.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. My son, I have been everywhere in search of you; why did you send
      for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. I did not send for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. No! but I must tell you your express has returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. So soon! impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Widow. Yes, he met the lady&rsquo;s father and mother on the road; they were
      going into the country on a visit. Your messenger says that Monsieur
      Deschappelles turned almost white with anger when he read your letter.
      They will be here almost immediately. Oh, Claude, Claude! what will they
      do to you? How I tremble! Ah, madam! do not let them injure him&mdash;if
      you knew how he doated on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Injure him! no, ma&rsquo;am, be not afraid;&mdash;my father! how shall
      I meet him? how go back to Lyons? the scoff of the whole city! Cruel,
      cruel, Claude [in great agitation]. Sir, you have acted most
      treacherously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. I know it, madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline [aside.] If he would but ask me to forgive him!&mdash;I never can
      forgive you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. I never dared to hope it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. But you are my husband now, and I have sworn to&mdash;to love
      you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. That was under a false belief, madam; Heaven and the laws will
      release you from your vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. He will drive me mad! if he were but less proud&mdash;if he would
      but ask me to remain&mdash;hark, hark&mdash;I hear the wheels of the
      carriage&mdash;Sir&mdash;Claude, they are coming; have you no word to say
      ere it is loo late? Quick speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. I can only congratulate you on your release. Behold your parents
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter MONSIEUR and MADAME DESCHAPPELLES and COLONEL DAMAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. My child! my child!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Oh, my poor Pauline!&mdash;what a villanous hovel this is!
      Old woman, get me a chair&mdash;I shall faint I certainly shall. What will
      the world say? Child, you have been a fool. A mother&rsquo;s heart is easily
      broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Ha, ha! most noble Prince&mdash;I am sorry to see a man of your
      quality in such a condition; I am afraid your highness will go to the
      House of Correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Taunt on, sir; I spared you when you were unarmed&mdash;I am unarmed
      now. A man who has no excuse for crime is indeed defenceless!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. There&rsquo;s something fine in the rascal, after all!
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Where is the impostor?&mdash;Are you thus shameless, traitor?
      Can you brave the presence of that girl&rsquo;s father?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. Strike me, if it please you&mdash;you are her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Sir&mdash;sir, for my sake; whatever his guilt, he has acted
      nobly in atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Nobly! Are you mad, girl? I have no patience with you&mdash;
      to disgrace all your family thus! Nobly! Oh you abominable, hardened,
      pitiful, mean, ugly villain!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Ugly! Why he was beautiful yesterday!
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. Madame, this is his roof, and he is my husband. Respect your
      daughter, or let blame fall alone on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. You&mdash;you&mdash;Oh, I&rsquo;m choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Sir, it were idle to waste reproach upon a conscience like
      yours&mdash;you renounce all pretensions to the person of this lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. I do. [Gives a paper.] Here is my consent to a divorce&mdash;my full
      confession of the fraud which annuls the marriage. Your daughter has been
      foully wronged&mdash;I grant it, sir; but her own lips will tell you that,
      from the hour in which she crossed this threshold, I returned to my own
      station, and respected hers. Pure and inviolate, as when yestermorn you
      laid your hand upon her head, and blessed her, I yield her back to you.
      For myself&mdash;I deliver you for ever from my presence. An outcast and a
      criminal, I seek some distant land, where I may mourn my sin, and pray for
      your daughter&rsquo;s peace. Farewell&mdash;farewell to you all, for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      Willow. Claude, Claude, you will not leave your poor old mother? She does
      not disown you in your sorrow no, not even in your guilt. No divorce can
      separate a mother from her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. This poor widow teaches me my duty. No, mother,&mdash;no, for you
      are now my mother also!&mdash;nor should any law, human or divine,
      separate the wife from her husband&rsquo;s sorrows. Claude&mdash;Claude&mdash;all
      is forgotten forgiven&mdash;I am thine for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. What do I hear?&mdash;Come away, or never see my face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Pauline, we never betrayed you!&mdash;do you forsake us for
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. [going back to her father]. Oh no&mdash;but you will forgive him
      too; we will live together&mdash;he shall be your son.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Never! Cling to him and forsake your parents! His home shall
      be yours&mdash;his fortune yours&mdash;his fate yours: the wealth I have
      acquired by honest industry shall never enrich the dishonest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline. And you would have a wife enjoy luxury while a husband toils!
      Claude, take me; thou canst not give me wealth, titles, station&mdash;but
      thou canst give me a true heart I will work for thee, tend thee, bear with
      thee, and never, never shall these lips reproach thee for the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I am not going to blubber!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. This is the heaviest blow of all!&mdash;What a heart I have wronged!&mdash;
      Do not fear me, sir; I am not all hardened&mdash;I will not rob her of a
      holier love than mine. Pauline!&mdash;angel of love and mercy!&mdash;your
      memory shall lead me back to virtue!&mdash;The husband of a being so
      beautiful in her noble and sublime tenderness may be poor&mdash;may be low
      born;&mdash;(there is no guilt in the decrees of providence!)&mdash;but he
      should be one who can look thee in the face without a blush,&mdash;to whom
      thy love does not bring remorse,&mdash;who can fold thee to his heart, and
      say,&mdash;&ldquo;Here there is no deceit!&rdquo; I am not that man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. [aside to MELNOTTE]. Thou art a noble fellow, notwithstanding; and
      wouldst make an excellent soldier. Serve in my regiment. I have had a
      letter from the Directory&mdash;our young general takes the command of the
      army in Italy,&mdash;I am to join him at Marseilles, I will depart this
      day, if thou wilt go with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. It is the favor I would have asked thee, if I dared. Place me
      wherever a foe is most dreaded,&mdash;wherever France most needs a life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. There shall not be a forlorn hope without thee!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mel. There is my hand!&mdash;mother, your blessing. I shall see you again,&mdash;a
      better man than a prince,&mdash;a man who has bought the right to high
      thoughts by brave deeds. And thou!&mdash;thou! so wildly worshipped, so
      guiltily betrayed, all is not yet lost!&mdash;for thy memory, at least,
      must be mine till death! If I live, the name of him thou hast once loved
      shall not rest dishonored;&mdash;if I fall, amidst the carnage and the
      roar of battle, my soul will fly back to thee, and love shall share with
      death my last sigh!&mdash;More&mdash;more would I speak to thee!&mdash;to
      pray!&mdash;to bless! But no; When I am less unworthy I will utter it to
      Heaven!&mdash;I cannot trust myself to [turning to DESCHAPPELLES] Your
      pardon, sir; they are my last words Farewell! [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. I will go after him.&mdash;France will thank me for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pauline [starting from her father&rsquo;s arms]. Claude!&mdash;Claude!&mdash;my
      husband!

    <p>
      Enter First, Second, and Third Officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      First Officer. Well, here we are at Lyons, with gallant old Damas: it is
      his native place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Officer. Yes; he has gained a step in the army since he was here

      Third Officer. Promotion is quick in the French army. This mysterious
      Morier,&mdash;the hero of Lodi, and the favorite of the
      commander-in-chief,&mdash;has risen to a colonel&rsquo;s rank to two years and a
      half. Enter DAMAS, as a General.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Good morrow, gentlemen; I hope you will amuse yourselves during our
      short stay at Lyons. It is a fine city: improved since I left it. Ah! it
      is a pleasure to grow old, when the years that bring decay to ourselves do
      but ripen the prosperity of our country. You have not met with Morier?
    </p>
    <p>
      First Officer. No: we were just speaking of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Officer. Pray, general, can you tell us who this Morier really is?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Is!&mdash;why a colonel in the French army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third Officer. True. But what was he at first?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. At first? Why a baby in long clothes, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      First Officer. Ha, ha! Ever facetious, general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Officer. [to Third]. The general is sore upon this point; you will
      only chafe him.&mdash;Any commands, general?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. None. Good day to you. [Exeunt Second and Third Officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Our comrades are very inquisitive. Poor Morier is the subject of a
      vast deal of curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      First Officer. Say interest, rather, general. His constant melancholy, the
      loneliness of his habits,&mdash;his daring valor, his brilliant rise in
      the profession,&mdash;your friendship, and the favors of the
      commander-in-chief,&mdash;all tend to make him as much the matter of
      gossip as of admiration. But where is he, general? I have missed him all
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Why, captain, I&rsquo;ll let you into a secret. My young friend has come
      with me to Lyons in hopes of finding a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      First Officer. A miracle!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Yes, a miracle! in other words,&mdash;a constant woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      First Officer. Oh! an affair of love!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Exactly so. No sooner did he enter Lyons than he waved his hand to
      me, threw himself from his horse, and is now, I warrant, asking every one
      who can know anything about the matter, whether a certain lady is still
      true to a certain gentleman!
    </p>
    <p>
      First Officer. Success to him! and of that success there can be no doubt.
      The gallant Colonel Morier, the hero of Lodi, might make his choice out of
      the proudest families in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Oh, if pride be a recommendation, the lady and her mother are most
      handsomely endowed. By the way, captain, if you should chance to meet with
      Morier, tell him he will find me at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      First Officer. I will, general. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Now will I go to the Deschappelles, and make a report to my young
      Colonel. Ha! by Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, Virorum,&mdash;here comes Monsieur
      Beauseant!
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter BEAUSEANT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good morrow, Monsieur Beauseant! How fares it with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [aside.] Damas! that is unfortunate;&mdash;if the Italian campaign
      should have filled his pockets, he may seek to baffle me in the moment of
      my victory. [Aloud]. Your servant, general,&mdash;for such, I think, is
      your new distinction! Just arrived in Lyons?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Not an hour ago. Well, how go on the Deschappelles? Have they
      forgiven you in that affair of young Melnotte? You had some hand in that
      notable device,&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Why, less than you think for! The fellow imposed upon me. I have set
      it all right now. What has become of him? He could not have joined the
      army, after all. There is no such name in the books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. I know nothing about Melnotte. As you say, I never heard the name
      in the Grand Army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Hem!&mdash;You are not married, general?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Do I look like a married man, sir?&mdash;No, thank Heaven! My
      profession is to make widows, not wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. You must have gained much booty in Italy! Pauline will be your
      heiress&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Booty! Not I! Heiress to what? Two trunks and a portmanteau,&mdash;
      four horses,&mdash;three swords, two suits of regimentals, and six pair of
      white leather inexpressibles! A pretty fortune for a young lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. [aside.] Then all is safe! [Aloud]. Ha! ha! Is that really all your
      capital, General Damas? Why, I thought Italy had been a second Mexico to
      you soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. All a toss-up, sir. I was not one of the lucky ones! My friend
      Morier, indeed, saved something handsome. But our commander-in-chief took
      care of him, and Morier is a thrifty, economical dog,&mdash;not like the
      rest of us soldiers, who spend our money as carelessly as if it were our
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. Well, it is no matter! I do not want fortune with Pauline. And you
      must know, General Damas, that your fair cousin has at length consented to
      reward my long and ardent attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. You!&mdash;the devil! Why, she is already married! There is no
      divorce!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. True; but this very day she is formally to authorize the necessary
      proceedings, this very day she is to sign the contract that is to make her
      mine within one week from the day on which her present illegal marriage is
      annulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. You tell me wonders!&mdash;Wonders! No; I believe anything of
      women!
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau. I must wish you good morning. [As he is going, enter DESCHAPPELLES.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Oh, Beauseant! well met. Let us come to the notary at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas [to Deschap.]. Why, cousin!
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Damas, welcome to Lyons. Pray call on us; my wife will be
      delighted to see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Your wife be-blessed for her condescension! But [taking him aside]
      what do I hear? Is it possible that your daughter has consented to a
      divorce?&mdash;that she will marry Monsieur Beauseant?
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Certainly. What have you to say against it? A gentleman of
      birth, fortune, character. We are not so proud as we were; even my wife
      has had enough of nobility and princes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. But Pauline loved that young man so tenderly!
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. [taking snuff]. That was two years and a half ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. Very true. Poor Melnotte!
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. But do not talk of that impostor; I hope he is dead or has
      left the country. Nay, even were he in Lyons at this moment, he ought to
      rejoice that, in an honorable and suitable alliance, my daughter may
      forget her sufferings and his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas.&mdash;Nay, if it be all settled, I have no more to say. Monsieur
      Beauseant informs me that the contract is to be signed this very day.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap, It is; at one o&rsquo;clock precisely. Will you be one of the
      witnesses?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damas. I?&mdash;No; that is to say&mdash;yes, certainly!&mdash;at one
      o&rsquo;clock I will wait on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Deschap. Till then, adieu&mdash;come Beauseant.

     Damas. The man who sets his heart upon a woman

     Changes with every wind,&mdash;grows lean or fat,
     Rosy with hope, or green with jealousy,

     Sate in my heart&mdash;was the sweet life of life.
     The Past was hers; I dreamt not of a Future

     Mel. Hush!&mdash;No word against her!
     Why should she keep, through years and silent absence,
     The holy tablets of her virgin faith
     True to a traitor&rsquo;s name! Oh, blame her not;

    <p>
      A room in the house of MONSIEUR DESCHAPPELLES; PAULINE seated in great
      dejection.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Pauline. It is so, then. I must be false to Love,
     Or sacrifice a father! Oh, my Claude,
     My lover, and my husband! Have I lived
     To pray that thou mayest find some fairer boon
     Than the deep faith of this devoted heart&mdash;
     Nourish&rsquo;d till now&mdash;now broken?

    <p>
      Enter MONSIEUR DESCHAPPELLES.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     M. Deschap. My dear child,
     How shall I thank&mdash;how bless thee? Thou hast saved,
     I will not say my fortune&mdash;I could bear
     Reverse, and shrink not&mdash;but that prouder wealth
     Which merchants value most&mdash;my name, my credit&mdash;
     The hard&mdash;won honors of a toilsome life:&mdash;
     These thou hast saved, my child!

     Pauline. Is there no hope?
     No hope but this?

     M. Deschap. None. If, without the sum
     Which Beauseant offers for thy hand, this day
     Sinks to the west&mdash;to-morrow brings our ruin!
     And hundreds, mingled in that ruin, curse
     The bankrupt merchant! and the insolvent herd

     Talk not of love. Love has no thought of self!

     The loathsome prostitution of a hand
     Without a heart? Love sacrifices all things
     To bless the thing it loves! He knows not love.

     My tears, my anguish, my remorse for falsehood&mdash;

     Thy youth will not be guardianless.

     Pauline. I have set
     My foot upon the ploughshare&mdash;I will pass

    </p>
    <p>
      Mme. Deschap. Why, Pauline, you are quite in deshabille&mdash;you ought to
      be more alive to the importance of this joyful occasion. We had once
      looked higher, it is true; but you see, after all, Monsieur Beauseant&rsquo;s
      father was a Marquis, and that&rsquo;s a great comfort. Pedigree and jointure!&mdash;you
      have them both in Monsieur Beauseant. A young lady decorously brought up
      should only have two considerations in her choice of a husband; first, is
      his birth honorable? secondly, will his death be advantageous? All other
      trifling details should be left to parental anxiety.

    <p>

      you are reconciled to an event which confers such rapture upon me.

      great revenge! Save the father, and spare the child.

    <p>
      Beau. [aside.] joy&mdash;joy alike to my hatred and my passion! The
      haughty Pauline is at last my suppliant. [Aloud.] You ask from me what I
      have not the sublime virtue to grant&mdash;a virtue reserved only for the
      gardener&rsquo;s son! I cannot forego my hopes in the moment of their
      fulfilment! I adhere to the contract&mdash;your father&rsquo;s ruin or your
      hand.

      blush? You are going to be divorced from poor Melnotte, and marry this
      rich gentleman. You ought to be excessively happy!

    <p>
      Pauline. The last plank to which I clung is shivered.

    <p>
      Damas. Hold&mdash;you see my friend Morier: Melnotte is his most intimate
      friend&mdash;fought in the same fields&mdash;slept in the same tent. Have
      you any message to send to Melnotte? any word to soften this blow?

      Pauline. He knows Melnotte&mdash;he will see him&mdash;he will bear to him
      my last farewell&mdash;[approaches MELNOTTE] He has a stern air&mdash;he
      turns away from me&mdash;he despises me!&mdash;Sir one word I beseech you.

     Mel. Lady, yes!&mdash;
     Myself And misery know the man!

     Pauline. And you will see him,
     And you will bear to him&mdash;ay&mdash;word for word,
     All that this heart, which breaks in parting from him,
     Would send, ere still for ever?

     Mel. He hath told me
     You have the right to choose from out the world
     A worthier bridegroom;&mdash;he forgoes all claim,
     Even to murmur at his doom. Speak on!

     Pauline. Tell him, for years I never nursed a thought
     That was not his;&mdash;that on his wandering way,
     Daily and nightly, pour&rsquo;d a mourner&rsquo;s prayers.
     Tell him ev&rsquo;n now that I would rather share
     His lowliest lot,&mdash;walk by his side, an outcast&mdash;
     Work for him, beg with him,&mdash;live upon the light
     Of one kind smile from him,&mdash;than wear the crown

     Mel. [aside.] Am I already mad?
     And does delirium utter such sweet words
     Into a dreamer&rsquo;s ear? [Aloud]. You love him thus,
     And yet desert him?

     Pauline. Say, that, if his eye&mdash;
     Could read this heart,&mdash;its struggles, its temptations,&mdash;
     His love itself would pardon that desertion!
     Look on that poor old man,&mdash;he is my father;
     He stands upon the verge of an abyss!&mdash;
     He calls his child to save him! Shall I shrink
     From him who gave me birth?&mdash;withhold my hand,
     And see a parent perish? Tell him this,
     And say&mdash;that we shall meet again in Heaven!

     Mel. Lady&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;what is this riddle?&mdash;what
     The nature of this sacrifice?

     Pauline [pointing to DAMAS]. Go, ask him!

     Beau. [from the table]. The papers are prepared&mdash;we only need
     Your hand and seal.

     Mel. Stay, lady&mdash;one word more.
     Were but your duty with your faith united,
     Would you still share the low-born peasant&rsquo;s lot?

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
