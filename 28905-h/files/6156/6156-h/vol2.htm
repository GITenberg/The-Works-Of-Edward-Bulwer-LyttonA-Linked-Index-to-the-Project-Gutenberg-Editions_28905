<p>
The Character and Popularity of Miltiades.&mdash;Naval Expedition.&mdash;Siege
of Paros.&mdash;Conduct of Miltiades.&mdash;He is Accused and Sentenced.&mdash;His
Death.
</p>
<p>
I.  History is rarely more than the biography of great men.  Through a
succession of individuals we trace the character and destiny of
nations.  THE PEOPLE glide away from us, a sublime but intangible
abstraction, and the voice of the mighty Agora reaches us only through
the medium of its representatives to posterity.  The more democratic
the state, the more prevalent this delegation of its history to the
few; since it is the prerogative of democracies to give the widest
competition and the keenest excitement to individual genius: and the
true spirit of democracy is dormant or defunct, when we find no one
elevated to an intellectual throne above the rest.  In regarding the
characters of men thus concentrating upon themselves our survey of a
nation, it is our duty sedulously to discriminate between their
qualities and their deeds: for it seldom happens that their renown in
life was unattended with reverses equally signal&mdash;that the popularity
of to-day was not followed by the persecution of to-morrow: and in
these vicissitudes, our justice is no less appealed to than our pity,
and we are called upon to decide, as judges, a grave and solemn cause
between the silence of a departed people, and the eloquence of
imperishable names.
</p>
<p>
We have already observed in the character of Miltiades that astute and
calculating temperament common to most men whose lot it has been to
struggle for precarious power in the midst of formidable foes.  We
have seen that his profound and scheming intellect was not accompanied
by any very rigid or high-wrought principle; and placed, as the chief
of the Chersonese had been from his youth upward, in situations of
great peril and embarrassment, aiming always at supreme power, and, in
his harassed and stormy domain, removed far from the public opinion of
the free states of Greece, it was natural that his political code
should have become tempered by a sinister ambition, and that the
citizen of Athens should be actuated by motives scarcely more
disinterested than those which animated the tyrant of the Chersonese.
The ruler of one district may be the hero, but can scarcely be the
patriot, of another.  The long influence of years and custom&mdash;the
unconscious deference to the opinion of those whom our youth has been
taught to venerate, can alone suffice to tame down an enterprising and
grasping mind to objects of public advantage, in preference to designs
for individual aggrandizement: influence of such a nature had never
operated upon the views and faculties of the hero of Marathon.
Habituated to the enjoyment of absolute command, he seemed incapable
of the duties of civil subordination; and the custom of a life urged
him onto the desire of power <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a>.  These features of his character
fairly considered, we shall see little to astonish us in the later
reverses of Miltiades, and find additional causes for the popular
suspicions he incurred.
</p>
<p>
II.  But after the victory of Marathon, the power of Miltiades was at
its height.  He had always possessed the affection of the Athenians,
which his manners as well as his talents contributed to obtain for
him.  Affable and courteous&mdash;none were so mean as to be excluded from
his presence; and the triumph he had just achieved so largely swelled
his popularity, that the most unhesitating confidence was placed in
all his suggestions.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the victory of Marathon, Miltiades, during his tyranny
in the Chersonese, had gratified the resentment and increased the
dominion of the Athenians.  A rude tribe, according to all authority,
of the vast and varied Pelasgic family, but essentially foreign to,
and never amalgamated with, the indigenous Pelasgians of the Athenian
soil, had in very remote times obtained a settlement in Attica.  They
had assisted the Athenians in the wall of their citadel, which
confirmed, by its characteristic masonry, the general tradition of
their Pelasgic race.  Settled afterward near Hymettus, they refused to
blend with the general population&mdash;quarrels between neighbours so near
naturally ensued&mdash;the settlers were expelled, and fixed themselves in
the Islands of Lemnos and Imbros&mdash;a piratical and savage horde.  They
kept alive their ancient grudge with the Athenians, and, in one of
their excursions, landed in Attica, and carried off some of the women
while celebrating a festival of Diana.  These captives they subjected
to their embraces, and ultimately massacred, together with the
offspring of the intercourse.  "The Lemnian Horrors" became a
proverbial phrase&mdash;the wrath of the gods manifested itself in the
curse of general sterility, and the criminal Pelasgi were commanded by
the oracle to repair the heinous injury they had inflicted on the
Athenians.  The latter were satisfied with no atonement less than that
of the surrender of the islands occupied by the offenders.  Tradition
thus reported the answer of the Pelasgi to so stern a demand&mdash;
"Whenever one of your vessels, in a single day and with a northern
wind, makes its passage to us, we will comply."
</p>
<p>
Time passed on, the injury was unatoned, the remembrance remained&mdash;
when Miltiades (then in the Chersonese) passed from Elnos in a single
day and with a north wind to the Pelasgian Islands, avenged the cause
of his countrymen, and annexed Lemnos and Imbros to the Athenian sway.
The remembrance of this exploit had from the first endeared Miltiades
to the Athenians, and, since the field of Marathon, he united in
himself the two strongest claims to popular confidence&mdash;he was the
deliverer from recent perils, and the avenger of hereditary wrongs.
</p>
<p>
The chief of the Chersonese was not slow to avail himself of the
advantage of his position.  He promised the Athenians a yet more
lucrative, if less glorious enterprise than that against the Persians,
and demanded a fleet of seventy ships, with a supply of men and money,
for an expedition from which he assured them he was certain to return
laden with spoil and treasure.  He did not specify the places against
which the expedition was to be directed; but so great was the belief
in his honesty and fortune, that the Athenians were contented to grant
his demand.  The requisite preparations made, Miltiades set sail.
Assuming the general right to punish those islands which had sided
with the Persian, he proceeded to Paros, which had contributed a
trireme to the armament of Datis.  But beneath the pretext of national
revenge, Miltiades is said to have sought the occasion to prosecute a
selfish resentment.  During his tyranny in the Chersonese, a Parian,
named Lysagoras, had sought to injure him with the Persian government,
and the chief now wreaked upon the island the retaliation due to an
individual.
</p>
<p>
Such is the account of Herodotus&mdash;an account not indeed inconsistent
with the vindictive passions still common to the inhabitants of the
western clime, but certainly scarce in keeping with the calculating
and politic character of Miltiades: for men go backward in the career
of ambition when revenging a past offence upon a foe that is no longer
formidable.
</p>
<p>
Miltiades landed on the island, laid vigorous siege to the principal
city, and demanded from the inhabitants the penalty of a hundred
talents.  The besieged refused the terms, and worked day and night at
the task of strengthening the city for defence.  Nevertheless,
Miltiades succeeded in cutting off all supplies, and the city was on
the point of yielding; when suddenly the chief set fire to the
fortifications he had erected, drew off his fleet, and returned to
Athens, not only without the treasure he had promised, but with an
ignominious diminution of the glory he had already acquired.  The most
probable reason for a conduct <a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2"><small>2</small></a> so extraordinary was, that by some
accident a grove on the continent was set on fire&mdash;the flame, visible
equally to the besiegers and the besieged, was interpreted alike by
both: each party imagined it a signal from the Persian fleet&mdash;the one
was dissuaded from yielding, and the other intimidated from
continuing the siege.  An additional reason for the retreat was a
severe wound in the leg which Miltiades had received, either in the
course of the attack, or by an accident he met with when attempting
with sacrilegious superstition to consult the infernal deities on
ground dedicated to Ceres.
</p>
<p>
III.  We may readily conceive the amazement and indignation with
which, after so many promises on the one side, and such unbounded
confidence on the other, the Athenians witnessed the return of this
fruitless expedition.  No doubt the wily and equivocal parts of the
character of Miltiades, long cast in shade by his brilliant qualities,
came now more obviously in view.  He was impeached capitally by
Xanthippus, an Athenian noble, the head of that great aristocratic
faction of the Alcmaeonids, which, inimical alike to the tyrant and
the demagogue, brooked neither a master of the state nor a hero with
the people.  Miltiades was charged with having accepted a bribe from
the Persians <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3"><small>3</small></a>, which had induced him to quit the siege of Paros at
the moment when success was assured.
</p>
<p>
The unfortunate chief was prevented by his wound from pleading his own
cause&mdash;he was borne into the court stretched upon his couch, while his
brother, Tisagoras, conducted his defence.  Through the medium of his
advocate, Miltiades seems neither vigorously to have refuted the
accusation of treason to the state, nor satisfactorily to have
explained his motives for raising the siege.  His glory was his
defence; and the chief answer to Xanthippus was "Marathon and Lemnos."
The crime alleged against him was of a capital nature; but, despite
the rank of the accuser, and the excitement of his audience, the
people refused to pronounce sentence of death upon so illustrious a
man.  They found him guilty, it is true&mdash;but they commuted the capital
infliction to a fine of fifty talents.  Before the fine was paid,
Miltiades expired of the mortification of his wound.  The fine was
afterward paid by his son, Cimon.  Thus ended a life full of adventure
and vicissitude.
</p>
<p>
The trial of Miltiades has often been quoted in proof of the
ingratitude and fickleness of the Athenian people.  No charge was ever
more inconsiderately made.  He was accused of a capital crime, not by
the people, but by a powerful noble.  The noble demanded his death&mdash;
appears to have proved the charge&mdash;to have had the law which imposed
death wholly on his side&mdash;and "the favour of the people it was," says
Herodotus, expressly, "which saved his life." <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4"><small>4</small></a>  When we consider
all the circumstances of the case&mdash;the wound to the popular vanity&mdash;
the disappointment of excited expectation&mdash;the unaccountable conduct
of Miltiades himself&mdash;and then see his punishment, after a conviction
which entailed death, only in the ordinary assessment of a pecuniary
fine <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5"><small>5</small></a>, we cannot but allow that the Athenian people (even while
vindicating the majesty of law, which in all civilized communities
must judge offences without respect to persons) were not in this
instance forgetful of the services nor harsh to the offences of their
great men.

<p>
The Athenian Tragedy.&mdash;Its Origin.&mdash;Thespis.&mdash;Phrynichus.&mdash;Aeschylus.
&mdash;Analysis of the Tragedies of Aeschylus.
</p>
<p>
I.  From the melancholy fate of Miltiades, we are now invited to a
subject no less connected with this important period in the history of
Athens.  The interval of repose which followed the battle of Marathon
allows us to pause, and notice the intellectual state to which the
Athenians had progressed since the tyranny of Pisistratus and his
sons.
</p>
<p>
We have remarked the more familiar acquaintance with the poems of
Homer which resulted from the labours and example of Pisistratus.
This event (for event it was), combined with other causes,&mdash;the
foundation of a public library, the erection of public buildings, and
the institution of public gardens&mdash;to create with apparent suddenness,
among a susceptible and lively population, a general cultivation of
taste.  The citizens were brought together in their hours of
relaxation <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6"><small>6</small></a>, by the urbane and social manner of life, under
porticoes and in gardens, which it was the policy of a graceful and
benignant tyrant to inculcate; and the native genius, hitherto
dormant, of the quick Ionian race, once awakened to literary and
intellectual objects, created an audience even before it found
expression in a poet.  The elegant effeminacy of Hipparchus
contributed to foster the taste of the people&mdash;for the example of the
great is nowhere more potent over the multitude than in the
cultivation of the arts.  Patronage may not produce poets, but it
multiplies critics.  Anacreon and Simonides, introduced among the
Athenians by Hipparchus, and enjoying his friendship, no doubt added
largely to the influence which poetry began to assume.  The peculiar
sweetness of those poets imbued with harmonious contagion the genius
of the first of the Athenian dramatists, whose works, alas! are lost
to us, though evidence of their character is preserved.  About the
same time the Athenians must necessarily have been made more
intimately acquainted with the various wealth of the lyric poets of
Ionia and the isles.  Thus it happened that their models in poetry
were of two kinds, the epic and the lyric; and, in the natural
connexion of art, it was but the next step to accomplish a species of
poetry which should attempt to unite the two.  Happily, at this time,
Athens possessed a man of true genius, whose attention early
circumstances had directed to a rude and primitive order of histrionic
recitation:&mdash;Phrynichus, the poet, was a disciple of Thespis, the
mime: to him belongs this honour, that out of the elements of the
broadest farce he conceived the first grand combinations of the tragic
drama.
</p>
<p>
II.  From time immemorial&mdash;as far back, perhaps, as the grove
possessed an altar, and the waters supplied a reed for the pastoral
pipe&mdash;Poetry and Music had been dedicated to the worship of the gods
of Greece.  At the appointed season of festival to each several deity,
his praises were sung, his traditionary achievements were recited.
One of the divinities last introduced into Greece&mdash;the mystic and
enigmatical Dionysos, or Bacchus, received the popular and
enthusiastic adoration naturally due to the God of the Vineyard, and
the "Unbinder of galling cares."  His festival, celebrated at the most
joyous of agricultural seasons <a href="#note-7" name="noteref-7"><small>7</small></a>, was associated also with the most
exhilarating associations.  Dithyrambs, or wild and exulting songs, at
first extemporaneous, celebrated the triumphs of the god.  By degrees,
the rude hymn swelled into prepared and artful measures, performed by
a chorus that danced circling round the altar; and the dithyramb
assumed a lofty and solemn strain, adapted to the sanctity of
sacrifice and the emblematic majesty of the god.  At the same time,
another band (connected with the Phallic procession, which, however
outwardly obscene, betokened only, at its origin, the symbol of
fertility, and betrays the philosophy of some alien and eastern creed
<a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8"><small>8</small></a>) implored in more lively and homely strains the blessing of the
prodigal and jovial deity.  These ceremonial songs received a wanton
and wild addition, as, in order, perhaps, more closely to represent
and personify the motley march of the Liber Pater, the chorus-singers
borrowed from the vine-browsing goat which they sacrificed the hides
and horns, which furnished forth the merry mimicry of the satyr and
the faun.  Under license of this disguise, the songs became more
obscene and grotesque, and the mummers vied with each other in
obtaining the applause of the rural audience by wild buffoonery and
unrestricted jest.  Whether as the prize of the winner or as the
object of sacrifice, the goat (tragos in the Greek) was a sufficiently
important personage to bestow upon the exhibition the homely name of
TRAGEDY, or GOATSONG, destined afterward to be exalted by association
with the proudest efforts of human genius.  And while the DITHYRAMB,
yet amid the Dorian tribes, retained the fire and dignity of its
hereditary character&mdash;while in Sicyon it rose in stately and mournful
measures to the memory of Adrastus, the Argive hero&mdash;while in Corinth,
under the polished rule of Periander, Arion imparted to the antique
hymn a new character and a more scientific music <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9"><small>9</small></a>,&mdash;gradually, in
Attica, it gave way before the familiar and fantastic humours of the
satyrs, sometimes abridged to afford greater scope to their
exhibitions&mdash;sometimes contracting the contagion of their burlesque.
Still, however, the reader will observe, that the tragedy, or
goatsong, consisted of two parts&mdash;first, the exhibition of the
mummers, and, secondly, the dithyrambic chorus, moving in a circle
round the altar of Bacchus.  It appears on the whole most probable,
though it is a question of fierce dispute and great uncertainty, that
not only this festive ceremonial, but also its ancient name of
tragedy, or goatsong, had long been familiar in Attica <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10"><small>10</small></a>, when,
about B. C. 535, during the third tyranny of Pisistratus, a skilful
and ingenious native of Icaria, an Attic village in which the
Eleutheria, or Bacchic rites, were celebrated with peculiar care,
surpassed all competitors in the exhibition of these rustic
entertainments.  He relieved the monotonous pleasantries of the
satyric chorus by introducing, usually in his own person, a histrionic
tale-teller, who, from an elevated platform, and with the lively
gesticulations common still to the popular narrators of romance on the
Mole of Naples, or in the bazars of the East, entertain the audience
with some mythological legend.  It was so clear that during this
recital the chorus remained unnecessarily idle and superfluous, that
the next improvement was as natural in itself, as it was important in
its consequences.  This was to make the chorus assist the narrator by
occasional question or remark.
</p>
<p>
The choruses themselves were improved in their professional art by
Thespis.  He invented dances, which for centuries, retained their
popularity on the stage, and is said to have given histrionic disguise
to his reciter&mdash;at first, by the application of pigments to the face;
and afterward, by the construction of a rude linen mask.
</p>
<p>
III.  These improvements, chiefly mechanical, form the boundary to the
achievements of Thespis.  He did much to create a stage&mdash;little to
create tragedy, in the proper acceptation of the word.  His
performances were still of a ludicrous and homely character, and much
more akin to the comic than the tragic.  Of that which makes the
essence of the solemn drama of Athens&mdash;its stately plot, its gigantic
images, its prodigal and sumptuous poetry, Thespis was not in any way
the inventor.  But PHRYNICHUS, the disciple of Thespis, was a poet; he
saw, though perhaps dimly and imperfectly, the new career opened to
the art, and he may be said to have breathed the immortal spirit into
the mere mechanical forms, when he introduced poetry into the bursts
of the chorus and the monologue of the actor.  Whatever else
Phrynichus effected is uncertain.  The developed plot&mdash;the
introduction of regular dialogue through the medium of a second actor
&mdash;the pomp and circumstance&mdash;the symmetry and climax of the drama&mdash;do
not appear to have appertained to his earlier efforts; and the great
artistical improvements which raised the simple incident to an
elaborate structure of depicted narrative and awful catastrophe, are
ascribed, not to Phrynichus, but Aeschylus.  If the later works of
Phrynichus betrayed these excellences, it is because Aeschylus had
then become his rival, and he caught the heavenly light from the new
star which was destined to eclipse him.  But every thing essential was
done for the Athenian tragedy when Phrynichus took it from the satyr
and placed it under the protection of the muse&mdash;when, forsaking the
humours of the rustic farce, he selected a solemn subject from the
serious legends of the most vivid of all mythologies&mdash;when he breathed
into the familiar measures of the chorus the grandeur and sweetness of
the lyric ode&mdash;when, in a word, taking nothing from Thespis but the
stage and the performers, he borrowed his tale from Homer and his
melody from Anacreon.  We must not, then, suppose, misled by the
vulgar accounts of the Athenian drama, that the contest for the goat,
and the buffooneries of Thespis, were its real origin; born of the
epic and the lyric song, Homer gave it character, and the lyrists
language.  Thespis and his predecessors only suggested the form to
which the new-born poetry should be applied.
</p>
<p>
IV.  Thus, under Phrynichus, the Thespian drama rose into poetry,
worthy to exercise its influence upon poetical emulation, when a young
man of noble family and sublime genius, rendered perhaps more
thoughtful and profound by the cultivation of a mystical philosophy
<a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11"><small>11</small></a>, which had lately emerged from the primitive schools of Ionian
wisdom, brought to the rising art the united dignity of rank,
philosophy, and genius.  Aeschylus, son of Euphorion, born at Eleusis
B. C. 525, early saturated a spirit naturally fiery and exalted with
the vivid poetry of Homer.  While yet a boy, and probably about the
time when Phrynichus first elevated the Thespian drama, he is said to
have been inspired by a dream with the ambition to excel in the
dramatic art.  But in Homer he found no visionary revelation to assure
him of those ends, august and undeveloped, which the actor and the
chorus might be made the instruments to effect.  For when the idea of
scenic representation was once familiar, the epics of Homer suggested
the true nature of the drama.  The great characteristic of that poet
is individuality.  Gods or men alike have their separate,
unmistakeable attributes and distinctions&mdash;they converse in dialogue&mdash;
they act towards an appointed end.  Bring Homer on the stage, and
introduce two actors instead of a narrator, and a drama is at once
effected.  If Phrynichus from the first borrowed his story from Homer,
Aeschylus, with more creative genius and more meditative intellect,
saw that there was even a richer mine in the vitality of the Homeric
spirit&mdash;the unity of the Homeric designs.  Nor was Homer, perhaps, his
sole though his guiding inspiration.  The noble birth of Aeschylus no
doubt gave him those advantages of general acquaintance with the
poetry of the rest of Greece, which an education formed under the
lettered dynasty of the Pisistratidae would naturally confer on the
well-born.  We have seen that the dithyramb, debased in Attica to the
Thespian chorus, was in the Dorian states already devoted to sublime
themes, and enriched by elaborate art; and Simonides, whose elegies,
peculiar for their sweetness, might have inspired the "ambrosial"
Phrynichus, perhaps gave to the stern soul of Aeschylus, as to his own
pupil Pindar, the model of a loftier music, in his dithyrambic odes.
</p>
<p>
V.  At the age of twenty-five, the son of Euphorion produced his first
tragedy.  This appears to have been exhibited in the year after the
appearance of Aristagoras at Athens,&mdash;in that very year so eventful
and important, when the Athenians lighted the flames of the Persian
war amid the blazing capital of Sardis.  He had two competitors in
Pratinas and Choerilus.  The last, indeed, preceded Phrynichus, but
merely in the burlesques of the rude Thespian stage; the example of
Phrynichus had now directed his attention to the new species of drama,
but without any remarkable talent for its cultivation.  Pratinas, the
contemporary of Aeschylus, did not long attempt to vie with his mighty
rival in his own line <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12"><small>12</small></a>.  Recurring to the old satyr-chorus, he
reduced its unmeasured buffooneries into a regular and systematic
form; he preserved the mythological tale, and converted it into an
artistical burlesque.  This invention, delighting the multitude, as it
adapted an ancient entertainment to the new and more critical taste,
became so popular that it was usually associated with the graver
tragedy; when the last becoming a solemn and gorgeous spectacle, the
poet exhibited a trilogy (or three tragedies) to his mighty audience,
while the satyric invention of Pratinas closed the whole, and answered
the purpose of our modern farce <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13"><small>13</small></a>.  Of this class of the Grecian
drama but one specimen remains, in the Cyclops of Euripides.  It is
probable that the birth, no less than the genius of Aeschylus, enabled
him with greater facility to make the imposing and costly additions to
the exhibition, which the nature of the poetry demanded&mdash;since, while
these improvements were rapidly proceeding, the poetical fame of
Aeschylus was still uncrowned.  Nor was it till the fifteenth year
after his first exhibition that the sublimest of the Greek poets
obtained the ivy chaplet, which had succeeded to the goat and the ox,
as the prize of the tragic contests.  In the course of a few years, a
regular stage, appropriate scenery and costume, mechanical inventions
and complicated stage machinery, gave fitting illusion to the
representation of gods and men.  To the monologue of Phrynichus,
Aeschylus added a second actor <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14"><small>14</small></a>; he curtailed the choruses,
connected them with the main story, and, more important than all else,
reduced to simple but systematic rules the progress and development of
a poem, which no longer had for its utmost object to please the ear or
divert the fancy, but swept on its mighty and irresistible march, to
besiege passion after passion, and spread its empire over the whole
soul.
</p>
<p>
An itinerant platform was succeeded by a regular theatre of wood&mdash;the
theatre of wood by a splendid edifice, which is said to have held no
less an audience than thirty thousand persons <a href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"><small>15</small></a>.  Theatrical
contests became a matter of national and universal interest.  These
contests occurred thrice a year, at three several festivals of Bacchus
<a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16"><small>16</small></a>.  But it was at the great Dionysia, held at the end of March and
commencement of April, that the principal tragic contests took place.
At that period, as the Athenian drama increased in celebrity, and
Athens herself in renown, the city was filled with visiters, not only
from all parts of Greece, but almost from every land in which the
Greek civilization was known.  The state took the theatre under its
protection, as a solemn and sacred institution.  So anxious were the
people to consecrate wholly to the Athenian name the glory of the
spectacle, that at the great Dionysia no foreigner, nor even any
metoecus (or alien settler), was permitted to dance in the choruses.
The chief archon presided, over the performances; to him was awarded
the selection of the candidates for the prize.  Those chosen were
allowed three actors <a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17"><small>17</small></a> by lot and a chorus, the expense of which
was undertaken by the state, and imposed upon one of the principal
persons of each tribe, called choragus.  Thus, on one occasion,
Themistocles was the choragus to a tragedy by Phrynichus.  The immense
theatre, crowded by thousands, tier above tier, bench upon bench, was
open to the heavens, and commanded, from the sloping hill on which it
was situated, both land and sea.  The actor apostrophized no mimic
pasteboard, but the wide expanse of Nature herself&mdash;the living sun,
the mountain air, the wide and visible Aegaean.  All was proportioned
to the gigantic scale of the theatre, and the mighty range of the
audience.  The form was artificially enlarged and heightened; masks of
exquisite art and beauty brought before the audience the ideal images
of their sculptured gods and heroes, while (most probably) mechanical
inventions carried the tones of the voice throughout the various tiers
of the theatre.  The exhibitions took place in the open day, and the
limited length of the plays permitted the performance of probably no
less than ten or twelve before the setting of the sun.  The sanctity
of their origin, and the mythological nature of their stories, added
something of religious solemnity to these spectacles, which were
opened by ceremonial sacrifice.  Dramatic exhibitions, at least for a
considerable period, were not, as with us, made hackneyed by constant
repetition.  They were as rare in their recurrence as they were
imposing in their effect; nor was a drama, whether tragic or comic,
that had gained the prize, permitted a second time to be exhibited.  A
special exemption was made in favour of Aeschylus, afterward extended
to Sophocles and Euripides.  The general rule was necessarily
stimulant of renewed and unceasing exertion, and was, perhaps, the
principal cause of the almost miraculous fertility of the Athenian
dramatists.
</p>
<p>
VI.  On the lower benches of the semicircle sat the archons and
magistrates, the senators and priests; while apart, but in seats
equally honoured, the gaze of the audience was attracted, from time to
time, to the illustrious strangers whom the fame of their poets and
their city had brought to the Dionysia of the Athenians.  The youths
and women <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"><small>18</small></a> had their separate divisions; the rest of the audience
were ranged according to their tribes, while the upper galleries were
filled by the miscellaneous and impatient populace.
</p>
<p>
In the orchestra (a space left by the semicircular benches, with wings
stretching to the right and left before the scene), a small square
platform served as the altar, to which moved the choral dances, still
retaining the attributes of their ancient sanctity.  The coryphaeus,
or leader of the chorus, took part in the dialogue as the
representative of the rest, and, occasionally, even several of the
number were excited into exclamations by the passion of the piece.
But the principal duty of the chorus was to diversify the dialogue by
hymns and dirges, to the music of flutes, while, in dances far more
artful than those now existent, they represented by their movements
the emotions that they sung <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19"><small>19</small></a>,&mdash;thus bringing, as it were, into
harmony of action the poetry of language.  Architectural
embellishments of stone, representing a palace, with three entrances,
the centre one appropriated to royalty, the others to subordinate
rank, usually served for the scene.  But at times, when the plot
demanded a different locality, scenes painted with the utmost art and
cost were easily substituted; nor were wanting the modern contrivances
of artificial lightning and thunder&mdash;the clouds for the gods&mdash;a
variety of inventions for the sudden apparition of demon agents,
whether from above or below&mdash;and all the adventitious and effective
aid which mechanism lends to genius.
</p>
<p>
VII.  Thus summoning before us the external character of the Athenian
drama, the vast audience, the unroofed and enormous theatre, the
actors themselves enlarged by art above the ordinary proportions of
men, the solemn and sacred subjects from which its form and spirit
were derived, we turn to Aeschylus, and behold at once the fitting
creator of its grand and ideal personifications.  I have said that
Homer was his original; but a more intellectual age than that of the
Grecian epic had arrived, and with Aeschylus, philosophy passed into
poetry.  The dark doctrine of fatality imparted its stern and awful
interest to the narration of events&mdash;men were delineated, not as mere
self-acting and self-willed mortals, but as the agents of a destiny
inevitable and unseen&mdash;the gods themselves are no longer the gods of
Homer, entering into the sphere of human action for petty motives and
for individual purposes&mdash;drawing their grandeur, not from the part
they perform, but from the descriptions of the poet;&mdash;they appear now
as the oracles or the agents of fate&mdash;they are visiters from another
world, terrible and ominous from the warnings which they convey.
Homer is the creator of the material poetry, Aeschylus of the
intellectual.  The corporeal and animal sufferings of the Titan in the
epic hell become exalted by tragedy into the portrait of moral
fortitude defying physical anguish.  The Prometheus of Aeschylus is
the spirit of a god disdainfully subjected to the misfortunes of a
man.  In reading this wonderful performance, which in pure and
sustained sublimity is perhaps unrivalled in the literature of the
world, we lose sight entirely of the cheerful Hellenic worship; and
yet it is in vain that the learned attempt to trace its vague and
mysterious metaphysics to any old symbolical religion of the East.
More probably, whatever theological system it shadows forth, was
rather the gigantic conception of the poet himself, than the imperfect
revival of any forgotten creed, or the poetical disguise of any
existent philosophy.  However this be, it would certainly seem, that,
in this majestic picture of the dauntless enemy of Jupiter, punished
only for his benefits to man, and attracting all our sympathies by his
courage and his benevolence, is conveyed something of disbelief or
defiance of the creed of the populace&mdash;a suspicion from which
Aeschylus was not free in the judgment of his contemporaries, and
which is by no means inconsonant with the doctrines of Pythagoras.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  The conduct of the fable is as follows: two vast demons,
Strength and Force, accompanied by Vulcan, appear in a remote plain of
earth&mdash;an unpeopled desert.  There, on a steril and lofty rock, hard
by the sea, Prometheus is chained by Vulcan&mdash;"a reward for his
disposition to be tender to mankind."  The date of this doom is cast
far back in the earliest dawn of time, and Jupiter has but just
commenced his reign.  While Vulcan binds him, Prometheus utters no
sound&mdash;it is Vulcan, the agent of his punishment, that alone
complains.  Nor is it till the dread task is done, and the ministers
of Jupiter have retired, that "the god, unawed by the wrath of gods,"
bursts forth with his grand apostrophe&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "Oh Air divine!  Oh ye swift-winged Winds&mdash;
     Ye sources of the Rivers, and ye Waves,
     That dimple o'er old Ocean like his smiles&mdash;
     Mother of all&mdash;oh Earth! and thou the orb,
     All-seeing, of the Sun, behold and witness
     What I, a god, from the stern gods endure.

          *     *     *     *     *     *

     When shall my doom be o'er?&mdash;Be o'er!&mdash;to me
     The Future hides no riddle&mdash;nor can wo
     Come unprepared!  It fits me then to brave
     That which must be: for what can turn aside
     The dark course of the grim Necessity?"
</pre>
<p>
While thus soliloquizing, the air becomes fragrant with odours, and
faintly stirs with the rustling of approaching wings.  The Daughters
of Ocean, aroused from their grots below, are come to console the
Titan.  They utter many complaints against the dynasty of Jove.
Prometheus comforts himself by the prediction that the Olympian shall
hereafter require his services, and that, until himself released from
his bondage, he will never reveal to his tyrant the danger that
menaces his realm; for the vanquished is here described as of a
mightier race than the victor, and to him are bared the mysteries of
the future, which to Jupiter are denied.  The triumph of Jupiter is
the conquest of brute force over knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Prometheus then narrates how, by means of his counsels, Jupiter had
gained his sceptre, and the ancient Saturn and his partisans been
whelmed beneath the abyss of Tartarus&mdash;how he alone had interfered
with Jupiter to prevent the extermination of the human race (whom
alone the celestial king disregarded and condemned)&mdash;how he had
imparted to them fire, the seed of all the arts, and exchanged in
their breasts the terrible knowledge of the future for the beguiling
flatteries of hope and hence his punishment.
</p>
<p>
At this time Ocean himself appears: he endeavours unavailingly to
persuade the Titan to submission to Jupiter.  The great spirit of
Prometheus, and his consideration for others, are beautifully
individualized in his answers to his consoler, whom he warns not to
incur the wrath of the tyrant by sympathy with the afflicted.  Alone
again with the Oceanides, the latter burst forth in fresh strains of
pity.
</p>
<pre>
    "The wide earth echoes wailingly,
         Stately and antique were thy fallen race,
       The wide earth waileth thee!
         Lo! from the holy Asian dwelling-place,
     Fall for a godhead's wrongs, the mortals' murmuring tears,
       They mourn within the Colchian land,
         The virgin and the warrior daughters,
       And far remote, the Scythian band,
         Around the broad Maeotian waters,
       And they who hold in Caucasus their tower,
           Arabia's martial flower
     Hoarse-clamouring 'midst sharp rows of barbed spears.

       One have I seen with equal tortures riven&mdash;
       An equal god; in adamantine chains
               Ever and evermore
       The Titan Atlas, crush'd, sustains
         The mighty mass of mighty Heaven,
       And the whirling cataracts roar,
       With a chime to the Titan's groans,
       And the depth that receives them moans;
       And from vaults that the earth are under,
       Black Hades is heard in thunder;
     While from the founts of white-waved rivers flow
     Melodious sorrows, wailing with his wo."
</pre>
<p>
Prometheus, in his answer, still farther details the benefits he had
conferred on men&mdash;he arrogates to himself their elevation to intellect
and reason <a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20"><small>20</small></a>.  He proceeds darkly to dwell on the power of
Necessity, guided by "the triform fates and the unforgetful Furies,"
whom he asserts to be sovereign over Jupiter himself.  He declares
that Jupiter cannot escape his doom: "His doom," ask the daughters of
Ocean, "is it not evermore to reign?"&mdash;"That thou mayst not learn,"
replies the prophet; "and in the preservation of this secret depends
my future freedom."
</p>
<p>
The rejoinder of the chorus is singularly beautiful, and it is with a
pathos not common to Aeschylus that they contrast their present
mournful strain with that which they poured
</p>
<pre>
    "What time the silence, erst was broken,
       Around the baths, and o'er the bed
     To which, won well by many a soft love-token,
     And hymn'd by all the music of delight,
       Our Ocean-sister, bright
         Hesione, was led!"
</pre>
<p>
At the end of this choral song appears Io, performing her mystic
pilgrimage <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"><small>21</small></a>.  The utter wo and despair of Io are finely contrasted
with the stern spirit of Prometheus.  Her introduction gives rise to
those ancestral and traditionary allusions to which the Greeks were so
attached.  In prophesying her fate, Prometheus enters into much
beautiful descriptive poetry, and commemorates the lineage of the
Argive kings.  After Io's departure, Prometheus renews his defiance to
Jupiter, and his stern prophecies, that the son of Saturn shall be
"hurled from his realm, a forgotten king."  In the midst of these
weird denunciations, Mercury arrives, charged by Jupiter to learn the
nature of that danger which Prometheus predicts to him.  The Titan
bitterly and haughtily defies the threats and warnings of the herald,
and exults, that whatever be his tortures, he is at least immortal,&mdash;
to be afflicted, but not to die.  Mercury at length departs&mdash;the
menace of Jupiter is fulfilled&mdash;the punishment is consummated&mdash;and,
amid storm and earthquake, both rock and prisoner are struck by the
lightnings of the god into the deep abyss.
</p>
<pre>
    "The earth is made to reel, and rumbling by,
     Bellowing it rolls, the thunder's gathering wrath!
     And the fierce fires glare livid; and along
     The rocks the eddies of the sands whirl high,
     Borne by the hurricane, and all the blasts
     Of all the winds leap forth, each hurtling each
     Met in the wildness of a ghastly war,
     The dark floods blended with the swooping heaven.
     It comes&mdash;it comes! on me it speeds&mdash;the storm,
     The rushing onslaught of the thunder-god;
     Oh, majesty of earth, my solemn mother!
     And thou that through the universal void,
     Circlest sweet light, all blessing; EARTH AND ETHER,
     YE I invoke, to know the wrongs I suffer."
</pre>
<p>
IX.  Such is the conclusion of this unequalled drama, epitomized
somewhat at undue length, in order to show the reader how much the
philosophy that had awakened in the age of Solon now actuated the
creations of poetry.  Not that Aeschylus, like Euripides, deals in
didactic sentences and oracular aphorisms.  He rightly held such
pedantries of the closet foreign to the tragic genius <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22"><small>22</small></a>.  His
philosophy is in the spirit, and not in the diction of his works&mdash;in
vast conceptions, not laconic maxims.  He does not preach, but he
inspires.  The "Prometheus" is perhaps the greatest moral poem in the
world&mdash;sternly and loftily intellectual&mdash;and, amid its darker and less
palpable allegories, presenting to us the superiority of an immortal
being to all mortal sufferings.  Regarded merely as poetry, the
conception of the Titan of Aeschylus has no parallel except in the
Fiend of Milton.  But perhaps the representation of a benevolent
spirit, afflicted, but not accursed&mdash;conquered, but not subdued by a
power, than which it is elder, and wiser, and loftier, is yet more
sublime than that of an evil demon writhing under the penance
deservedly incurred from an irresistible God.  The one is intensely
moral&mdash;at once the more moral and the more tragic, because the
sufferings are not deserved, and therefore the defiance commands our
sympathy as well as our awe; but the other is but the picture of a
righteous doom, borne by a despairing though stubborn will; it affords
no excitement to our courage, and forbids at once our admiration and
our pity.
</p>
<p>
X.  I do not propose to conduct the reader at length through the other
tragedies of Aeschylus; seven are left to us, to afford the most
striking examples which modern or ancient literature can produce of
what perhaps is the true theory of the SUBLIME, viz., the elevating
the imagination by means of the passions, for a moral end.
</p>
<p>
Nothing can be more grand and impressive than the opening of the
"Agamemnon," with the solitary watchman on the tower, who, for ten
long years, has watched nightly for the beacon-fires that are to
announce the fall of Ilion, and who now beholds them blaze at last.
The description which Clytemnestra gives of the progress of these
beacon-fires from Troy to Argos is, for its picturesque animation, one
of the most celebrated in Aeschylus.  The following lines will convey
to the general reader a very inadequate reflection, though not an
unfaithful paraphrase, of this splendid passage <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23"><small>23</small></a>.  Clytemnestra
has announced to the chorus the capture of Troy.  The chorus, half
incredulous, demand what messenger conveyed the intelligence.
Clytemnestra replies:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "A gleam&mdash;a gleam&mdash;from Ida's height,
       By the fire&mdash;god sent, it came;
     From watch to watch it leap'd that light,
       As a rider rode the flame!
         It shot through the startled sky;
           And the torch of that blazing glory
         Old Lemnos caught on high,
           On its holy promontory,
         And sent it on, the jocund sign,
         To Athos, mount of Jove divine.
       Wildly the while it rose from the isle,
     So that the might of the journeying light
       Skimm'd over the back of the gleaming brine!
         Farther and faster speeds it on,
       Till the watch that keep Macistus steep&mdash;
           See it burst like a blazing sun!
             Doth Macistus sleep
             On his tower&mdash;clad steep?
       No! rapid and red doth the wild-fire sweep
         It flashes afar, on the wayward stream
         Of the wild Euripus, the rushing beam!
       It rouses the light on Messapion's height,
       And they feed its breath with the withered heath.
             But it may not stay!
             And away&mdash;away
         It bounds in its freshening might.
             Silent and soon,
             Like a broadened moon,
           It passes in sheen, Asopus green, <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24"><small>24</small></a>
         And bursts on Cithaeron gray.
       The warder wakes to the signal rays,
       And it swoops from the hill with a broader blaze,
         On&mdash;on the fiery glory rode&mdash;
         Thy lonely lake, Gorgopis, glowed&mdash;
         To Megara's Mount it came;
           They feed it again,
           And it streams amain
         A giant beard of flame!
       The headland cliffs that darkly down
       O'er the Saronic waters frown,
       Are pass'd with the swift one's lurid stride,
       And the huge rock glares on the glaring tide,
       With mightier march and fiercer power
       It gain'd Arachne's neighbouring tower&mdash;
       Thence on our Argive roof its rest it won,
       Of Ida's fire the long-descended son
         Bright harbinger of glory and of joy!
       So first and last with equal honour crown'd,
       In solemn feasts the race-torch circles round.
       And these my heralds! this my SIGN OF PEACE!
       Lo! while we breathe, the victor lords of Greece,
         Stalk, in stern tumult, through the halls of Troy!" <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25"><small>25</small></a>
</pre>
<p>
In one of the earlier choruses, in which is introduced an episodical
allusion to the abduction of Helen, occurs one of those soft passages
so rare in Aeschylus, nor less exquisite than rare.  The chorus
suppose the minstrels of Menelaus thus to lament the loss of Helen:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "And wo the halls, and wo the chiefs,
       And wo the bridal bed!
     And we her steps&mdash;for once she loved
       The lord whose love she fled!
     Lo! where, dishonour yet unknown,
     He sits&mdash;nor deems his Helen flown,
     Tearless and voiceless on the spot;
     All desert, but he feels it not!
     Ah! soon alive, to miss and mourn
     The form beyond the ocean borne
         Shall start the lonely king!
     And thought shall fill the lost one's room,
     And darkly through the palace gloom
         Shall stalk a ghostly thing. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26"><small>26</small></a>
       Her statues meet, as round they rise,
       The leaden stare of lifeless eyes.
     Where is their ancient beauty gone?&mdash;
     Why loathe his looks the breathing stone?
     Alas! the foulness of disgrace
     Hath swept the Venus from her face!
     And visions in the mournful night
     Shall dupe the heart to false delight,
         A false and melancholy;
     For naught with sadder joy is fraught,
     Than things at night by dreaming brought,
         The wish'd for and the holy.
     Swift from the solitary side,
     The vision and the blessing glide,
     Scarce welcomed ere they sweep,
       Pale, bloodless, dreams, aloft
       On wings unseen and soft,
     Lost wanderers gliding through the paths of sleep."
</pre>
<p>
But the master-terror of this tragedy is in the introduction of
Cassandra, who accompanies Agamemnon, and who, in the very hour of his
return, amid the pomp and joy that welcome the "king of men," is
seized with the prophetic inspiration, and shrieks out those ominous
warnings, fated ever to be heard in vain.  It is she who recalls to
the chorus, to the shuddering audience, that it is the house of the
long-fated Atridae, to which their descendant has returned&mdash;"that
human shamble-house&mdash;that bloody floor&mdash;that dwelling, abhorred by
Heaven, privy to so many horrors against the most sacred ties;" the
doom yet hangs over the inexpiable threshold; the curse passes from
generation to generation; Agamemnon is the victim of his sires.
</p>
<p>
Recalling the inhuman banquet served by Atreus to Thyestes of his own
murdered children, she starts from the mangled spectres on the
threshold:
</p>
<pre>
    "See ye those infants crouching by the floor,
     Like phantom dreams, pale nurslings, that have perish'd
     By kindred hands."
</pre>
<p>
Gradually her ravings become clear and clearer, until at last she
scents the "blood-dripping slaughter within;" a vapour rises to her
nostrils as from a charnel house&mdash;her own fate, which she foresees at
hand, begins to overpower her&mdash;her mood softens, and she enters the
palace, about to become her tomb, with thoughts in which frantic
terror has yielded to solemn and pathetic resignation:
</p>
<pre>
    "Alas for mortals!&mdash;what their power and pride?
     A little shadow sweeps it from the earth!
     And if they suffer&mdash;why, the fatal hour
     Comes o'er the record like a moistened sponge,
     And blots it out; <i>methinks this latter lot
     Affects me deepest&mdash;Well! 'tis pitiful!"</i> <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27"><small>27</small></a>
</pre>
<p>
Scarcely has the prophetess withdrawn than we hear behind the scene
the groans of the murdered king, the palace behind is opened, and
Clytemnestra is standing, stern and lofty, by the dead body of her
lord.  The critics have dwelt too much on the character of
Clytemnestra&mdash;it is that of Cassandra which is the masterpiece of the
tragedy.
</p>
<p>
XI.  The story, which is spread throughout three plays (forming a
complete trilogy), continues in the opening of the Choephori, with
Orestes mourning over his father's tomb.  If Clytemnestra has
furnished would-be critics with a comparison with Lady Macbeth, for no
other reason than that one murdered her husband, and the other
persuaded her husband to murder somebody else, so Orestes may with
more justice be called the Hamlet of the Greeks; but though the
character itself of Orestes is not so complex and profound as that of
Hamlet, nor the play so full of philosophical beauties as the modern
tragedy, yet it has passages equally pathetic, and more sternly and
terribly sublime.  The vague horror which in the commencement of the
play prepares us for the catastrophe by the dream of Clytemnestra&mdash;how
a serpent lay in swaddling-clothes like an infant, and she placed it
in her breast, and it drew blood; the brief and solemn answer of
Orestes&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "Man's visions never come to him in vain;"
</pre>
<p>
the manner in which the avenging parricide interrupts the dream, so
that (as in Macbeth) the prediction inspires the deed that it
foretells; the dauntless resolution of Clytemnestra, when she hears, in
the dark sayings of her servant, that "the dead are slaying the
living" (i. e., that through the sword of Orestes Agamemnon is avenged
on Aegisthus), calls for a weapon, royal to the last, wishing only to
</p>
<pre>
    "Know which shall be the victor or the vanquished&mdash;
     Since that the crisis of the present horror;"
</pre>
<p>
the sudden change from fierce to tender as Orestes bursts in, and,
thinking only of her guilty lover, she shrieks forth,
</p>
<pre>
    "Ah! thou art then no more, beloved Aegisthus;"
</pre>
<p>
the advance of the threatening son, the soft apostrophe of the mother
as she bares her bosom&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "Hold! and revere this breast on which so oft
     Thy young cheek nestled&mdash;cradle of thy sleep,
     And fountain of thy being;"
</pre>
<p>
the recoil of Orestes&mdash;the remonstrance of Pylades&mdash;the renewed
passion of the avenger&mdash;the sudden recollection of her dream, which
the murderess scarcely utters than it seems to confirm Orestes to its
fulfilment, and he pursues and slays her by the side of the adulterer;
all these passages are full of so noble a poetry, that I do not think
the parallel situations in Hamlet equal their sustained and solemn
grandeur.  But the sublimest effort of the imagination is in the
conclusion.  While Orestes is yet justifying the deed that avenged a
father, strange and confused thoughts gradually creep over him.  No
eyes see them but his own&mdash;there they are, "the Gorgons, in vestments
of sable, their eyes dropping loathly blood!"  Slowly they multiply,
they approach, still invisible but to their prey&mdash;"the angry
hell-hounds of his mother."  He flies, the fresh blood yet dripping
from his hands.  This catastrophe&mdash;the sudden apparition of the Furies
ideally imaged forth to the parricide alone&mdash;seems to me greater in
conception than the supernatural agency in Hamlet.  The visible ghost
is less awful than the unseen Furies.
</p>
<p>
The plot is continued through the third piece of the trilogy (the
Eumenides), and out of Aeschylus himself, no existing tragedy presents
so striking an opening&mdash;one so terrible and so picturesque.  It is the
temple of Apollo at Delphi.  The priestess, after a short invocation,
enters the sacred edifice, but suddenly returns.  "A man," she says,
"is at the marble seat, a suppliant to the god&mdash;his bloody hands hold
a drawn sword and a long branch of olive.  But around the man sleep a
wondrous and ghastly troop, not of women, but of things woman-like,
yet fiendish; harpies they seem, but are not; black-robed and
wingless, and their breath is loud and baleful, and their eyes drop
venom&mdash;and their garb is neither meet for the shrines of God nor the
habitations of men.  Never have I seen (saith the Pythian) a nation
which nurtured such a race."  Cheered by Apollo, Orestes flies while
the dread sisters yet sleep; and now within the temple we behold the
Furies scattered around, and a pale and lofty shape, the ghost of
Clytemnestra, gliding on the stage, awakens the agents of her
vengeance.  They break forth as they rouse themselves, "Seize&mdash;seize&mdash;
seize."  They lament&mdash;they bemoan the departure of their victim, they
expostulate with Apollo, who expels them from his temple.  The scene
changes; Orestes is at Athens,&mdash;he pleads his cause before the temple
of Minerva.  The contest is now shared by gods; Apollo and the Furies
are the pleaders&mdash;Pallas is the umpire, the Areopagites are the
judges.  Pallas casts in her vote in favour of Orestes&mdash;the lots are
equal&mdash;he is absolved; the Furies, at first enraged, are soothed by
Minerva, and, invited to dwell in Athens, pour blessings on the land.
A sacred but joyous procession crowns the whole.  Thus the
consummation of the trilogy is cheerful, though each of the two former
pieces is tragic; and the poet artfully conduces the poem to the
honour of his native Athens and the venerable Areopagus.  Regarding
the three as one harmonious and united performance, altogether not so
long as one play of Shakspeare's, they are certainly not surpassed in
greatness of thought, in loftiness of conception, and in sustained
vigour of execution, by any poem in the compass of literature; nor,
observing their simple but compact symmetry as a whole, shall we do
right to subscribe to those who deny to Aeschylus the skill of the
artist, while they grant him the faculty of the poet.
</p>
<p>
The ingenious Schlegel attributes to these tragedies symbolical
interpretations, but to my judgment with signal ill-success.  These
four tragedies&mdash;the Prometheus, the Agamemnon, the Choephori, and the
Eumenides&mdash;are in grandeur immeasurably superior to the remaining
three.
</p>
<p>
XII.  Of these last, the Seven against Thebes is the best.  The
subject was one peculiarly interesting to Greece; the War of the Seven
was the earliest record of a league among the Grecian princes, and of
an enterprise carried on with a regular and systematic design.  The
catastrophe of two brothers falling by each other's hand is terrible
and tragic, and among the most national of the Grecian legends.  The
fierce and martial spirit of the warrior poet runs throughout the
play; his descriptions are animated as with the zeal and passion of
battle; the chorus of Theban virgins paint in the most glowing colours
the rush of the adverse hosts&mdash;the prancing of the chargers&mdash;the sound
of their hoofs, "rumbling as a torrent lashing the side of cliffs;" we
hear the creak of the heavy cars&mdash;the shrill whiz of the javelins,
"maddening the very air"&mdash;the showers of stones crashing over the
battlements&mdash;the battering at the mighty gates&mdash;the uproar of the
city&mdash;the yells of rapine&mdash;the shrieks of infants "strangled by the
bubbling blood."  Homer himself never accumulated more striking images
of horror.  The description of Tydeus is peculiarly Homeric&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "Three shadowy crests, the honours of his helm,
     Wave wild, and shrilly from his buckler broad
     The brazen bell rings terror.  On the shield
     He bears his haughty ensign&mdash;typed by stars
     Gleaming athwart the sky, and in the midst
     Glitters the royal Moon&mdash;the Eye of Night.
     Fierce in the glory of his arms, his voice
     Roars by the river banks; and drunk with war
     He pants, as some wild charger, when the trump
     Clangs ringing, as he rushes on the foe."
</pre>
<p>
The proud, dauntless, and warlike spirit of Eteocles which is designed
and drawn with inconceivable power, is beautifully characterized in
his reply to the above description:
</p>
<pre>
    "Man hath no armour, war hath no array,
     At which this heart can tremble; no device
     Nor blazonry of battle can inflict
     The wounds they menace; crests and clashing bells
     Without the spear are toothless, and the night,
     Wrought on yon buckler with the stars of heaven,
     Prophet, perchance, his doom; and if dark Death
     Close round his eyes, are but the ominous signs
     Of the black night that waits him."
</pre>
<p>
The description of each warrior stationed at each gate is all in the
genius of Homer, closing as it does with that of Polynices, the
brother of the besieged hero, whom, when he hears his name, Eteocles
himself resolves to confront.  At first, indeed, the latter breaks out
into exclamations which denote the awe and struggle of the abhorrent
nature; forebodings of his own doom flit before him, he feels the
curses of his sire are ripening to their fruit, and that the last
storm is yet to break upon the house of Oedipus.  Suddenly he checks
the impulse, sensible of the presence of the chorus.  He passes on to
reason with himself, through a process of thought which Shakspeare
could not have surpassed.  He conjures up the image of that brother,
hateful and unjust from infancy to boyhood, from boyhood up to youth&mdash;
he assures himself that justice would be forsworn if this foe should
triumph&mdash;and rushes on to his dread resolve.
</p>
<pre>
    "'Tis I will face this warrior; who can boast
     A right to equal mine?  Chief against chief&mdash;
     Foe against foe!&mdash;and brother against brother.
     What, ho! my greaves, my spear, my armour proof
     Against this storm of stones!  My stand is chosen."
</pre>
<p>
Eteocles and his brother both perish in the unnatural strife, and the
tragedy ends with the decree of the senators to bury Eteocles with due
honours, and the bold resolution of Antigone (the sister of the dead)
to defy the ordinance which forbids a burial to Polynices&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "For mighty is the memory of the womb
     From which alike we sprung&mdash;a wretched mother!"
</pre>
<p>
The same spirit which glows through the "Seven against Thebes" is also
visible in the "Persians," which, rather picturesque than dramatic, is
tragedy brought back to the dithyrambic ode.  It portrays the defeat
of Xerxes, and contains one of the most valuable of historical
descriptions, in the lines devoted to the battle of Salamis.  The
speech of Atossa (the mother of Xerxes), in which she enumerates the
offerings to the shade of Darius, is exquisitely beautiful.
</p>
<pre>
                "The charms that sooth the dead:
    White milk, and lucid honey, pure-distill'd
    By the wild bee&mdash;that craftsman of the flowers;
    The limpid droppings of the virgin fount,
    And this bright liquid from its mountain mother
    Born fresh&mdash;the joy of the time&mdash;hallowed vine;
    The pale-green olive's odorous fruit, whose leaves
    Live everlastingly&mdash;and these wreathed flowers,
    The smiling infants o' the prodigal earth."
</pre>
<p>
Nor is there less poetry in the invocation of the chorus to the shade
of Darius, which slowly rises as they conclude.  But the purpose for
which the monarch returns to earth is scarcely sufficient to justify
his appearance, and does not seem to be in accordance with the power
over our awe and terror which the poet usually commands.  Darius hears
the tale of his son's defeat&mdash;warns the Persians against interfering
with the Athenians&mdash;tells the mother to comfort and console her son&mdash;
bids the chorus (who disregard his advice) give themselves to mirth,
even though in affliction, "for to the dead riches are no advantage"&mdash;
and so returns to his repose, which seems very unnecessarily
disturbed.
</p>
<p>
"The Suppliants," which Schlegel plausibly conjectures to have been
the intermediate piece of a trilogy, is chiefly remarkable as a proof
of the versatility of the poet.  All horror has vanished from the
scene; the language is soft when compared with the usual diction of
Aeschylus; the action is peaceful, and the plot extremely simple,
being merely the protection which the daughters of Danaus obtain at
the court of Pelasgus from the pursuit of the sons of Aegyptus.  The
heroines of the play, the Danaides, make the chorus, and this serves
to render the whole, yet more than the Persians, a lyric rather than a
tragedy.  The moral of the play is homely and primitive, and seems
confined to the inculcation of hospitality to strangers, and the
inviolable sanctity of the shrine.  I do not know any passages in "The
Suppliants" that equal in poetry the more striking verses of "The
Persians," or "The Seven against Thebes."
</p>
<p>
XIII.  Attempts have been made to convey to modern readers a more
familiar notion of Aeschylus by comparisons with modern poets.  One
critic likens him to Dante, another to Milton&mdash;but he resembles
neither.  No modern language can convey a notion of the wonderful
strength of his diction&mdash;no modern poet, of the stern sublimity of his
conceptions.  The French tragedians may give some weak reflection of
Euripides or even of Sophocles, but none have ventured upon the sacred
territory of the father of the tragic drama.  He defies all imitation.
His genius is so near the verge of bombast, that to approach his
sublime is to rush into the ridiculous. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28"><small>28</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Aeschylus never once, in the plays that have come down to us,
delineates love, except by an expression or two as regards the passion
of Clytemnestra for Aegisthus <a href="#note-29" name="noteref-29"><small>29</small></a>.  It was emblematic of a new state
of society when Euripides created the Phaedra and the Medea.  His
plots are worked out by the simplest and the fewest positions.  But he
had evidently his own theory of art, and studied with care such stage
effects as appeared to him most striking and impressive.  Thus, in the
burlesque contest between Aeschylus and Euripides, in the comedy of
"The Frogs," the former is censured, not for too rude a neglect, but
for too elaborate a cultivation, of theatrical craft&mdash;such as
introducing his principal characters, his Niobe and Achilles <a href="#note-30" name="noteref-30"><small>30</small></a>,
with their faces hid, and preserving long and obstinate silence, in
order by that suspense to sharpen the expectation of the audience.
Aeschylus, in fact, contrary to the general criticism, was as earnest
and thoughtful an artist as Sophocles himself.  There was this
difference, it is true; one invented the art and the other perfected.
</p>
<p>
But the first requires as intense a study as the last; and they who
talk of the savage and untutored genius of Aeschylus, are no wiser
than the critics who applied the phrase of "native wood-notes wild" to
the consummate philosophy of "Hamlet," the anatomical correctness of
"Othello," the delicate symmetry of "The Tempest."  With respect to
the language of Aeschylus, ancient critics unite with the modern in
condemning the straining of his metaphors, and the exaggeration of his
images; yet they appear to me a necessary part of his genius, and of
the effect it produces.  But nothing can be more unsatisfactory and
inconclusive than the theory of Schlegel, that such metaphors and
images, such rugged boldness and irregular fire, are the
characteristics of a literature in its infancy.  On the contrary, as
we have already seen, Phrynichus, the predecessor of Aeschylus, was as
much characterized by sweetness and harmony, as Aeschylus by grandeur
and headlong animation.  In our own time, we have seen the cold
classic school succeeded by one full of the faults which the German,
eloquent but superficial, would ascribe to the infancy of literature.
The diction of Aeschylus was the distinction of himself, and not of
his age; if it require an apology, let us not seek it in false
pretences; if he had written after Euripides, his diction would have
been equally startling, and his metaphors equally lofty.  His genius
was one of those which, in any age, can form an era, and not that
which an era necessarily forms.  He might have enriched his music from
the strains of the Dorian lyres, but he required only one poet to have
lived before him.  The rest of the Greek dramatists required
Aeschylus&mdash;Aeschylus required only Homer.
</p>
<p>
The POET is, indeed, the creator, not of images solely, but of men&mdash;
not of one race of ideas and characters, but of a vast and
interminable posterity scattered over the earth.  The origin of what
wonderful works, in what distant regions, in what various time, may be
traced, step by step, from influence to influence, till we arrive at
Homer!  Such is the vitality of genius.  The true spiritual
transmigrator&mdash;it passes through all shapes&mdash;losing identity, but not
life&mdash;and kindred to the GREAT INTELLIGENCE, which is the soul of
matter&mdash;departing from one form only to animate another.

<p>
I.  While the progress of the drama and the genius of Aeschylus
contributed to the rising renown of Athens, there appeared on the
surface of her external affairs two rival and principal actors, of
talents and designs so opposite, that it soon became evident that the
triumph of one could be only in the defeat of the other.  Before the
battle of Marathon, Aristides had attained a very considerable
influence in Athens.  His birth was noble&mdash;his connexions wealthy&mdash;his
own fortune moderate.  He had been an early follower and admirer of
Clisthenes, the establisher of popular institutions in Athens after
the expulsion of the Pisistratidae, but he shared the predilection of
many popular chieftains, and while opposing the encroachments of a
tyranny, supported the power of an aristocracy.  The system of
Lycurgus was agreeable to his stern and inflexible temper.  His
integrity was republican&mdash;his loftiness of spirit was patrician.  He
had all the purity, the disinterestedness, and the fervour of a
patriot&mdash;he had none of the suppleness or the passion of a demagogue;
on the contrary, he seems to have felt much of that high-spirited
disdain of managing a people which is common to great minds conscious
that they are serving a people.  His manners were austere, and he
rather advised than persuaded men to his purposes.  He pursued no
tortuous policy, but marched direct to his object, fronting, and not
undermining, the obstacles in his path.  His reputation for truth and
uprightness was proverbial, and when some lines in Aeschylus were
recited on the stage, implying that "to be, and not to seem, his
wisdom was," the eyes of the spectators were fixed at once upon
Aristides.  His sternness was only for principles&mdash;he had no harshness
for men.  Priding himself on impartiality between friends and foes, he
pleaded for the very person whom the laws obliged him to prosecute;
and when once, in his capacity of arbiter between two private persons,
one of the parties said that his opponent had committed many injuries
against Aristides, he rebuked him nobly: "Tell me not," he said, "of
injuries against myself, but against thee.  It is thy cause I am
adjudging, and not my own."  It may be presumed, that with these
singular and exalted virtues, he did not seek to prevent the wounds
they inflicted upon the self-love of others, and that the qualities of
a superior mind were displayed with the bearing of a haughty spirit.
He became the champion of the aristocratic party, and before the
battle of Marathon he held the office of public treasurer.  In this
capacity Plutarch asserts that he was subjected to an accusation by
Themistocles, and even intimates that Themistocles himself had been
his predecessor in that honourable office <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31"><small>31</small></a>.  But the youth of
Themistocles contradicts this statement; and though his restless and
ambitious temper had led him already into active life, and he might
have combined with others more influential against Aristides, it can
scarcely be supposed that, possessing no advantages of birth, he rose
into much power or distinction, till he won sudden and popular
applause by his gallantry at Marathon.
</p>
<p>
II.  Themistocles was of illegitimate birth, according to the Athenian
prejudice, since his mother was a foreigner.  His father, though
connected with the priestly and high-born house of the Lycomedae, was
not himself a Eupatrid.  The young Themistocles had many of the
qualities which the equivocal condition of illegitimacy often educes
from active and stirring minds&mdash;insolence, ostentation, the desire to
shine, and the invincible ambition to rise.  He appears, by a popular
tale, to have early associated with his superiors, and to have evinced
betimes the art and address which afterward distinguished him.  At a
meeting of all the illegitimate youths assembled at the wrestling-ring
at Cynosarges, dedicated to Hercules, he persuaded some of the young
nobles to accompany him, so as to confound as it were the distinction
between the legitimate and the baseborn.  His early disposition was
bold, restless, and impetuous.  He paid little attention to the
subtleties of schoolmen, or the refinements of the arts; but even in
boyhood devoted himself to the study of politics and the arts of
government.  He would avoid the sports and occupations of his
schoolfellows, and compose declamations, of which the subject was the
impeachment or defence of some of his young friends.  His dispositions
prophesied of his future career, and his master was wont to say, "that
he was born to be a blessing or a curse to the commonwealth."  His
strange and precocious boyhood was followed by a wild and licentious
youth.  He lived in extremes, and alternated between the loosest
pleasures <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32"><small>32</small></a> and the most daring ambition.  Entering prematurely
into public life, either his restless disposition or his political
principles embroiled him with men of the highest rank.  Fearless and
sanguine, he cared not whom he attacked, or what he adventured; and,
whatever his conduct before the battle of Marathon, the popular
opinions he embraced could not but bring him, after that event, in
constant opposition to Aristides, the champion of the Areopagus.
</p>
<p>
That splendid victory which gave an opening to his career sharpened
his ambition.  The loud fame of Miltiades, yet unconscious of reverse,
inspired him with a lofty envy.  He seems from that period to have
forsaken his more youthful excesses.  He abstained from his wonted
pursuits and pleasures&mdash;he indulged much in solitary and abstracted
thought&mdash;he watched whole nights.  His friends wondered at the change,
and inquired the cause.  "The trophies of Miltiades," said he, "will
not suffer me to sleep."  From these meditations, which are common to
most men in the interval between an irregular youth and an aspiring
manhood, he soon seems to have awakened with fixed objects and
expanded views.  Once emerged from the obscurity of his birth, his
success was rapid, for he possessed all the qualities which the people
demanded in a leader&mdash;not only the talents and the courage, but the
affability and the address.  He was an agreeable and boon companion&mdash;
he committed to memory the names of the humblest citizens&mdash;his
versatility enabled him to be all things to all men.  Without the
lofty spirit and beautiful mind of Pericles, without the prodigal but
effeminate graces of Alcibiades&mdash;without, indeed, any of their
Athenian poetry in his intellectual composition, he yet possessed much
of their powers of persuasion, their ready talent for business, and
their genius of intrigue.  But his mind, if coarser than that of
either of his successors, was yet perhaps more masculine and
determined; nothing diverted him from his purpose&mdash;nothing arrested
his ambition.  His ends were great, and he associated the rise of his
country with his more selfish objects, but he was unscrupulous as to
his means.  Avid of glory, he was not keenly susceptible to honour.
He seems rather not to have comprehended, than comprehending, to have
disdained the limits which principle sets to action.  Remarkably
far-sighted, he possessed, more than any of his contemporaries, the
prophetic science of affairs: patient, vigilant, and profound, he was
always energetic, because always prepared.
</p>
<p>
Such was the rival of Aristides, and such the rising leader of the
popular party at Athens.
</p>
<p>
III.  History is silent as to the part taken by Aristides in the
impeachment of Miltiades, but there is no reason to believe that he
opposed the measure of the Alcmaeonid party with which he acted, and
which seems to have obtained the ascendency after the death of
Miltiades.  In the year following the battle of Marathon, we find
Aristides in the eminent dignity of archon.  In this office he became
generally known by the title of the Just.  His influence, his official
rank, the power of the party that supported him, soon rendered him the
principal authority of Athens.  The courts of the judges were
deserted, every litigant repaired to his arbitration&mdash;his
administration of power obtained him almost the monopoly of it.
Still, however, he was vigorously opposed by Themistocles and the
popular faction led by that aspiring rival.
</p>
<p>
By degrees; various reasons, the chief of which was his own high
position, concurred to diminish the authority of Aristides; even among
his own partisans he lost ground, partly by the jealousy of the
magistrates, whose authority he had superseded&mdash;and partly, doubtless,
from a maxim more dangerous to a leader than any he can adopt, viz.,
impartiality between friends and foes in the appointment to offices.
Aristides regarded, not the political opinions, but the abstract
character or talents, of the candidates.  With Themistocles, on the
contrary, it was a favourite saying, "The gods forbid that I should be
in power, and my friends no partakers of my success."  The tendency of
the first policy is to discontent friends, while it rarely, if ever,
conciliates foes; neither is it so elevated as it may appear to the
superficial; for if we contend for the superiority of one set of
principles over another, we weaken the public virtue when we give
equal rewards to the principles we condemn as to the principles we
approve.  We make it appear as if the contest had been but a war of
names, and we disregard the harmony which ought imperishably to exist
between the opinions which the state should approve and the honours
which the state can confer.  He who is impartial as to persons must
submit to seem lukewarm as to principles.  Thus the more towering and
eminent the seeming power of Aristides, the more really hollow and
insecure were its foundations.  To his own party it was unproductive&mdash;
to the multitude it appeared unconstitutional.  The extraordinary
honours he had acquired&mdash;his monopoly of the magistrature&mdash;his
anti-popular opinions, could not but be regarded with fear by a people
so jealous of their liberties.  He seemed to their apprehensions to be
approaching gradually to the sovereignty of the state&mdash;not, indeed, by
guards and military force, but the more dangerous encroachments of
civil authority.  The moment for the attack arrived.  Themistocles
could count at last upon the chances of a critical experiment, and
Aristides was subjected to the ordeal of the ostracism.
</p>
<p>
IV.  The method of the ostracism was this:&mdash;each citizen wrote upon a
shell, or a piece of broken earthenware, the name of the person he
desired to banish.  The magistrates counted the shells, and if they
amounted to six thousand (a very considerable proportion of the free
population, and less than which rendered the ostracism invalid), they
were sorted, and the man whose name was found on the greater number of
shells was exiled for ten years, with full permission to enjoy his
estates.  The sentence was one that honoured while it afflicted, nor
did it involve any other accusation than that of being too powerful or
too ambitious for the citizen of a free state.  It is a well-known
story, that, during the process of voting, an ignorant burgher came to
Aristides, whose person he did not know, and requested him to write
down the name of Aristides.
</p>
<p>
"Has he ever injured you?" asked the great man.
</p>
<p>
"No," answered the clown, "nor do I know him even by sight; but it
vexes me to hear him everywhere called the 'Just.'"
</p>
<p>
Aristides replied not&mdash;he wrote his own name on the shell, and
returned it to the enlightened voter.  Such is a tale to which more
importance than is its due has been attached.  Yet perhaps we can give
a new reading to the honest burgher's reply, and believe that it was
not so expressive of envy at the virtue, as of fear at the reputation.
Aristides received the sentence of exile (B. C. 483) with his
accustomed dignity.  His last words on leaving his native city were
characteristic of his generous and lofty nature.  "May the Athenian
people," he said, "never know the day which shall force them to
remember Aristides!"&mdash;A wish, fortunately alike for the exile and the
people, not realized.  That day, so patriotically deprecated, soon
came, glorious equally to Athens and Aristides, and the reparation of
wrong and the triumph of liberty found a common date.
</p>
<p>
The singular institution of the ostracism is often cited in proof of
the ingratitude of a republic, and the fickleness of a people; but it
owed its origin not to republican disorders, but to despotic
encroachment&mdash;not to a people, but to a tyrant.  If we look throughout
all the Grecian states, we find that a tyranny was usually established
by some able and artful citizen, who, attaching himself either to the
aristocratic, or more frequently to the popular party, was suddenly
elevated into supreme power, with the rise of the faction he had
espoused.  Establishing his fame by popular virtues, he was enabled
often to support his throne by a moral authority&mdash;more dangerous than
the odious defence of military hirelings: hence necessarily arose
among the free states a jealousy of individuals, whose eminence became
such as to justify an undue ambition; and hence, for a long period,
while liberty was yet tender and insecure, the (almost) necessity of
the ostracism.
</p>
<p>
Aristotle, who laments and condemns the practice, yet allows that in
certain states it was absolutely requisite; he thinks the evil it is
intended to prevent "might have been provided for in the earlier
epochs of a commonwealth, by guarding against the rise of one man to a
dangerous degree of power; but where the habits and laws of a nation
are so formed as to render it impossible to prevent the rise, you must
then guard against its consequences:" and in another part of his
Politics he observes, "that even in republics, where men are regarded,
not according to their wealth, but worth&mdash;where the citizens love
liberty and have arms and valour to defend it; yet, should the
pre-eminent virtues of one man, or of one family, totally eclipse the
merit of the community at large, you have but two choices&mdash;the
ostracism or the throne."
</p>
<p>
If we lament the precaution, we ought then to acknowledge the cause.
The ostracism was the creature of the excesses of the tyrannical, and
not of the popular principle.  The bland and specious hypocrisy of
Pisistratus continued to work injury long after his death&mdash;and the
ostracism of Aristides was the necessary consequence of the seizure of
the citadel.  Such evil hath arbitrary power, that it produces
injustice in the contrary principles as a counterpart to the injustice
of its own; thus the oppression of our Catholic countrymen for
centuries resulted from the cruelties and persecutions of a papal
ascendency.  We remembered the danger, and we resorted to the rigid
precaution.  To guard against a second tyranny of opinion, we
condemned, nor perhaps without adequate cause, not one individual, but
a whole sect, to a moral ostracism.  Ancient times are not then so
opposite to the present&mdash;and the safety of the state may excuse, in a
republic as in a monarchy, a thousand acts of abstract injustice.  But
the banishment of Aristides has peculiar excuses in the critical
circumstances of the time.  The remembrance of Pisistratus was still
fresh&mdash;his son had but just perished in an attempt on his country&mdash;the
family still lived, and still menaced: the republic was yet in its
infancy&mdash;a hostile aristocracy within its walls&mdash;a powerful enemy
still formidable without.  It is a remarkable fact, that as the
republic strengthened, and as the popular power increased, the custom
of ostracism was superseded.  The democratic party was never so strong
as at the time in which it was finally abolished.  It is the
insecurity of power, whether in a people or a king, that generates
suspicion.  Habituated to liberty, a people become less rigid and more
enlightened as to its precautions.
</p>
<p>
V.  It had been a saying of Aristides, "that if the Athenians desired
their affairs to prosper, they ought to fling Themistocles and himself
into the barathrum."  But fortune was satisfied at this time with a
single victim, and reserved the other for a later sacrifice.  Relieved
from the presence of a rival who had constantly crossed and obstructed
his career, Themistocles found ample scope for his genius.  He was not
one of those who are unequal to the situation it costs them so much to
obtain.  On his entrance into public life he is said by Theophrastus
to have possessed only three talents; but the account is inconsistent
with the extravagance of his earlier career, and still more with the
expenses to which a man who attempts to lead a party is, in all
popular states, unavoidably subjected.  More probably, therefore, it
is said of him by others, that he inherited a competent patrimony, and
he did not scruple to seize upon every occasion to increase it,
whether through the open emolument or the indirect perquisites of
public office.  But, desiring wealth as a means, not an end, he
grasped with one hand to lavish with the other.  His generosity
dazzled and his manners seduced the people, yet he exercised the power
he acquired with a considerate and patriotic foresight.  From the
first retreat of the Persian armament he saw that the danger was
suspended, and not removed.  But the Athenians, who shared a common
Grecian fault, and ever thought too much of immediate, too little of
distant peril, imagined that Marathon had terminated the great contest
between Asia and Europe.  They forgot the fleets of Persia, but they
still dreaded the galleys of Aegina.  The oligarchy of that rival
state was the political enemy of the Athenian demos; the ally of the
Persian was feared by the conqueror, and every interest, military and
commercial, contributed to feed the passionate and jealous hate that
existed against a neighbour, too near to forget, too warlike to
despise.  The thoughtful and profound policy of Themistocles resolved
to work this popular sentiment to ulterior objects; and urging upon a
willing audience the necessity of making suitable preparations against
Aegina, then the mistress of the seas, he proposed to construct a
navy, fitted equally to resist the Persian and to open a new dominion
to the Athenians.
</p>
<p>
To effect this purpose he called into aid one of the most valuable
sources of her power which nature had bestowed upon Athens.
</p>
<p>
VI.  Around the country by the ancient Thoricus, on the road from the
modern Kerratia to the Cape of Sunium, heaps of scoriae indicate to
the traveller that he is in the neighbourhood of the once celebrated
silver-mines of Laurion; he passes through pines and woodlands&mdash;he
notices the indented tracks of wheels which two thousand years have
not effaced from the soil&mdash;he discovers the ancient shafts of the
mines, and pauses before the foundations of a large circular tower and
the extensive remains of the castles which fortified the neighbouring
town <a href="#note-33" name="noteref-33"><small>33</small></a>.  A little farther, and still passing among mine-banks and
hillocks of scoriae, he beholds upon Cape Colonna the fourteen
existent columns of the temple of Minerva Sunias.  In this country, to
which the old name is still attached <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34"><small>34</small></a>, is to be found a principal
cause of the renown and the reverses of Athens&mdash;of the victory of
Salamis&mdash;of the expedition to Sicily.
</p>
<p>
It appears that the silver-mines of Laurion had been worked from a
very remote period&mdash;beyond even any traditional date.  But as it is
well and unanswerably remarked, "the scarcity of silver in the time of
Solon proves that no systematic or artificial process of mining could
at that time have been established." <a href="#note-35" name="noteref-35"><small>35</small></a>  It was, probably, during
the energetic and politic rule of the dynasty of Pisistratus that
efficient means were adopted to derive adequate advantage from so
fertile a source of national wealth.  And when, subsequently, Athens,
profiting from the lessons of her tyrants, allowed the genius of her
free people to administer the state, fresh necessity was created for
wealth against the hostility of Sparta&mdash;fresh impetus given to general
industry and public enterprise.  Accordingly, we find that shortly
after the battle of Marathon, the yearly profits of the mines were
immense.  We learn from the researches of one of those eminent Germans
<a href="#note-36" name="noteref-36"><small>36</small></a> who have applied so laborious a learning with so subtle an
acuteness to the elucidation of ancient history, that these mines were
always considered the property of the state; shares in them were sold
to individuals as tenants in fee farms, and these proprietors paid,
besides, an annual sum into the public treasury, amounting to the
twenty-fourth part of the produce.  The state, therefore, received a
regular revenue from the mines, derived from the purchase&mdash;moneys and
the reserved rents.  This revenue had been hitherto divided among all
the free citizens, and the sum allotted to each was by no means
inconsiderable, when Themistocles, at an early period of his career
(before even the ostracism of Aristides), had the courage to propose
that a fund thus lucrative to every individual should be appropriated
to the national purpose of enlarging the navy.  The feud still carried
on with the Aeginetans was his pretext and excuse.  But we cannot
refuse our admiration to the fervent and generous order of public
spirit existent at that time, when we find that it was a popular
leader who proposed to, and carried through, a popular assembly the
motion, that went to empoverish the men who supported his party and
adjudged his proposition.  Privileged and sectarian bodies never
willingly consent to a surrender of pecuniary benefits for a mere
public end.  But among the vices of a popular assembly, it possesses
the redeeming virtue to be generous.  Upon a grand and unconscious
principle of selfishness, a democracy rarely grudges a sacrifice
endured for the service of the state.
</p>
<p>
The money thus obtained was devoted to the augmentation of the
maritime force to two hundred triremes&mdash;an achievement that probably
exhausted the mine revenue for some years; and the custom once broken,
the produce of Laurion does not seem again to have been wasted upon
individuals.  To maintain and increase the new navy, a decree was
passed, either at that time <a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37"><small>37</small></a>, or somewhat later, which ordained
twenty triremes to be built yearly.
</p>
<p>
VII.  The construction of these vessels, the very sacrifice of the
citizens, the general interest that must have attached to an
undertaking that was at once novel in itself, and yet congenial not
more to the passions of a people, who daily saw from their own heights
the hostile rock of Aegina, "the eyesore of the Piraeus," than to the
habits of men placed in a steril land that on three sides tempted to
the sea&mdash;all combined to assist Themistocles in his master policy&mdash;a
policy which had for its design gradually to convert the Athenians
from an agricultural into a maritime people.  What was imputed to him
as a reproach became his proudest distinction, viz., that "he first
took his countrymen from the spear and shield, and sent them to the
bench and oar."

<h2>
    CHAPTER IV.
</h2>
<p>
The Preparations of Darius.&mdash;Revolt of Egypt.&mdash;Dispute for the
Succession to the Persian Throne.&mdash;Death of Darius.&mdash;Brief Review of
the leading Events and Characteristics of his Reign.
</p>
<p>
I.  While, under the presiding genius of Themistocles, Athens was
silently laying the foundation of her naval greatness, and gradually
increasing in influence and renown, the Persian monarch was not
forgetful of the burning of Sardis and the defeat of Marathon.  The
armies of a despotic power are often slow to collect, and unwieldy to
unite, and Darius wasted three years in despatching emissaries to
various cities, and providing transports, horses, and forage for a new
invasion.
</p>
<p>
The vastness of his preparations, though congenial to oriental
warfare, was probably proportioned to objects more great than those
which appear in the Greek historians.  There is no reason, indeed, to
suppose that he cherished the gigantic project afterward entertained
by his son&mdash;a project no less than that of adding Europe as a province
to the empire of the East.  But symptoms of that revolt in Egypt which
shortly occurred, may have rendered it advisable to collect an
imposing force upon other pretences; and without being carried away by
any frantic revenge against the remote and petty territory of Athens,
Darius could not but be sensible that the security of his Ionian,
Macedonian, and Thracian conquests, with the homage already rendered
to his sceptre by the isles of Greece, made it necessary to redeem the
disgrace of the Persian arms, and that the more insignificant the foe,
the more fatal, if unpunished, the example of resistance.  The Ionian
coasts&mdash;the entrance into Europe&mdash;were worth no inconsiderable effort,
and the more distant the provinces to be awed, the more stupendous,
according to all rules of Asiatic despotism, should appear the
resources of the sovereign.  He required an immense armament, not so
much for the sake of crushing the Athenian foe, as of exhibiting in
all its might the angry majesty of the Persian empire.
</p>
<p>
II.  But while Asia was yet astir with the martial preparations of the
great king, Egypt revolted from his sway, and, at the same time, the
peace of Darius was imbittered, and his mind engaged, by a contest
among his sons for the succession to the crown (B. C. 486).
Artabazanes, the eldest of his family, born to him by his first wife,
previous to his own elevation to the throne, founded his claim upon
the acknowledged rights of primogeniture; but Xerxes, the eldest of a
second family by Atossa, daughter of the great Cyrus, advanced, on the
other hand, a direct descent from the blood of the founder of the
Persian empire.  Atossa, who appears to have inherited something of
her father's genius, and who, at all events, exercised unbounded
influence over Darius, gave to the claim of her son a stronger support
than that which he could derive from argument or custom.  The intrigue
probably extended from the palace throughout the pure Persian race,
who could not but have looked with veneration upon a descendant of
Cyrus, nor could there have seemed a more popular method of
strengthening whatever was defective in the title of Darius to the
crown, than the transmission of his sceptre to a son, in whose person
were united the rights of the new dynasty and the sanctity of the old.
These reasonings prevailed with Darius, whose duty it was to nominate
his own successor, and Xerxes was declared his heir.  While the
contest was yet undecided, there arrived at the Persian court
Demaratus, the deposed and self-exiled king of Sparta.  He attached
himself to the cause and person of Xerxes, and is even said to have
furnished the young prince with new arguments, founded on the usages
of Sparta&mdash;an assertion not to be wholly disregarded, since Demaratus
appeared before the court in the character of a monarch, if in the
destitution of an exile, and his suggestions fell upon the ear of an
arbiter willing to seize every excuse to justify the resolution to
which he had already arrived.
</p>
<p>
This dispute terminated, Darius in person prepared to march against
the Egyptian rebels, when his death (B. C. 485) consigned to the
inexperienced hands of his heir the command of his armies and the
execution of his designs.
</p>
<p>
The long reign of Darius, extending over thirty-six years, was
memorable for vast improvements in the administrations of the empire,
nor will it, in this place, be an irrelevant digression to glance
briefly and rapidly back over some of the events and the innovations
by which it was distinguished.
</p>
<p>
III.  The conquest of Cyrus had transplanted, as the ruling people, to
the Median empire, a race of brave and hardy, but simple and
uncivilized warriors.  Cambyses, of whose character no unequivocal
evidence remains, since the ferocious and frantic crimes ascribed to
him <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38"><small>38</small></a> are conveyed to us through the channel of the Egyptian
priests, whom he persecuted, most probably, rather as a political
nobility than a religious caste, could but slightly have improved the
condition of the people, or the administration of the empire, since
his reign lasted but seven years and five months, during which he was
occupied with the invasion of Africa and the subjugation of Egypt.  At
the conclusion of his reign he was menaced by a singular conspiracy.
The Median magi conspired in his absence from the seat of empire to
elevate a Mede to the throne.  Cambyses, under the impulse of jealous
and superstitious fears, had lately put to death Smerdis, his brother.
The secret was kept from the multitude, and known only to a few&mdash;among
others, to the magian whom Cambyses had intrusted with the charge of
his palace at Susa, an office as important as confidential.  This man
conceived a scheme of amazing but not unparalleled boldness.  His
brother, a namesake of the murdered prince, resembled the latter also
in age and person.  This brother, the chief of the household, with the
general connivance of his sacerdotal caste, who were naturally anxious
to restore the Median dynasty, suddenly declared to be the true
Smerdis, and the impostor, admitted to possession of the palace,
asserted his claim to the sovereign power.  The consent of the magi&mdash;
the indifference of the people&mdash;the absence, not only of the king, but
of the flower of the Persian race&mdash;and, above all, the tranquil
possession of the imperial palace, conspired to favour the deceit.
<a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39"><small>39</small></a>  Placed on the Persian throne, but concealing his person from the
eyes of the multitude in the impenetrable pomp of an Oriental
seraglio, the pseudo Smerdis had the audacity to despatch, among the
heralds that proclaimed his accession, a messenger to the Egyptian
army, demanding their allegiance.  The envoy found Cambyses at
Ecbatana in Syria.  Neither cowardice nor sloth was the fault of that
monarch; he sprang upon his horse, determined to march at once to
Susa, when the sheath fell from his sword, and he received a mortal
wound from the naked blade.  Cambyses left no offspring, and the
impostor, believed by the people to be the true son of Cyrus, issued,
from the protecting and august obscurity of his palace, popular
proclamations and beneficent edicts.  Whatever his present fraud,
whatever his previous career, this daring Mede was enabled to make his
reign beloved and respected.  After his death he was regretted by all
but the Persians, who would not have received the virtues of a god as
an excuse for the usurpation of a Mede.  Known to the vast empire only
by his munificence of spirit&mdash;by his repeal of tribute and service,
the impostor permitted none to his presence who could have detected
the secret.  He never quitted his palace&mdash;the nobles were not invited
to his banquets&mdash;the women in his seraglio were separated each from
each&mdash;and it was only in profound darkness that the partners of his
pleasures were admitted to his bed.  The imposture is said by
Herodotus to have been first discovered in the following manner:&mdash;the
magian, according to the royal custom, had appropriated to himself the
wives of Cambyses; one of these was the daughter of Otanes, a Persian
noble whom the secluded habits of the pretended king filled with
suspicion.  For some offence, the magian had been formerly deprived of
his ears by the order of Cyrus.  Otanes communicated this fact, with
his suspicions, to his daughter, and the next time she was a partaker
of the royal couch, she took the occasion of his sleep to convince
herself that the sovereign of the East was a branded and criminal
impostor.  The suspicions of Otanes verified, he entered, with six
other nobles, into a conspiracy, which mainly owed its success to the
resolution and energy of one among them, named Darius, who appears to
have held a station of but moderate importance among the royal guard,
though son of Hystaspes, governor of the province of Persis, and of
the purest and loftiest blood of Persia.  The conspirators penetrated
the palace unsuspected&mdash;put the eunuchs who encountered them to death
&mdash;and reached the chamber in which the usurper himself was seated with
his brother.  The impostors, though but imperfectly armed, defended
themselves with valour; two of the conspirators were wounded, but the
swords of the rest sufficed to consummate the work, and Darius himself
gave the death-blow to one of the brothers.
</p>
<p>
This revolution was accompanied and stained by an indiscriminate
massacre of the magi.  Nor did the Persians, who bore to that Median
tribe the usual hatred which conquerors feel to the wisest and noblest
part of the conquered race, content themselves with a short-lived and
single revenge.  The memory of the imposture and the massacre was long
perpetuated by a solemn festival, called "the slaughter of the Magi,"
or Magophonia, during which no magian was permitted to be seen abroad.
</p>
<p>
The result of this conspiracy threw into the hands of the seven nobles
the succession to the Persian throne: the election fell upon Darius,
the soul of the enterprise, and who was of that ancient and princely
house of the Achaemenids, in which the Persians recognised the family
of their ancestral kings.  But the other conspirators had not
struggled solely to exchange one despot for another.  With a new
monarchy arose a new oligarchy.  Otanes was even exempted from
allegiance to the monarch, and his posterity were distinguished by
such exclusive honours and immunities, that Herodotus calls them the
only Persian family which retained its liberty.  The other
conspirators probably made a kind of privileged council, since they
claimed the right of access at all hours, unannounced, to the presence
of the king&mdash;a privilege of the utmost value in Eastern forms of
government&mdash;and their power was rendered permanent and solid by
certain restrictions on marriage <a href="#note-40" name="noteref-40"><small>40</small></a>, which went to maintain a
constant alliance between the royal family and their own.  While the
six conspirators rose to an oligarchy, the tribe of the Pasargadae&mdash;
the noblest of those sections into which the pure Persian family was
divided&mdash;became an aristocracy to officer the army and adorn the
court.  But though the great body of the conquered Medes were kept in
subject inferiority, yet the more sternly enforced from the Persian
resentment at the late Median usurpation, Darius prudently conciliated
the most powerful of that great class of his subjects by offices of
dignity and command, and of all the tributary nations, the Medes
ranked next to the Persians.
</p>
<p>
IV.  With Darius, the Persian monarchy progressed to that great crisis
in the civilization of those states founded by conquering Nomades,
when, after rich possessions are seized, cities built, and settlements
established, the unwieldy and enormous empire is divided into
provinces, and satrap government reflects in every district the
mingled despotism and subservience, pomp and insecurity, of the
imperial court.  Darius undoubtedly took the most efficient means in
his power to cement his sway and organize his resources.  For the
better collection of tribute, twenty provinces were created, governed
by twenty satraps.  Hitherto no specific and regular tax had been
levied, but the Persian kings had been contented with reluctant
presents, or arbitrary extortions.  Darius now imposed a limited and
annual impost, amounting, according to the computation of Herodotus,
to fourteen thousand five hundred and sixty talents, collected
partially from Africa, principally from Asia <a href="#note-41" name="noteref-41"><small>41</small></a>.  The Persians, as
the conquering and privileged race, were excluded from the general
imposition, but paid their moderate contribution under the softer
title of gratuity.  The Colchians fixed their own burdens&mdash;the
Ethiopians that bordered Egypt, with the inhabitants of the sacred
town of Nyssa, rendered also tributary gratuities&mdash;while Arabia
offered the homage of her frankincense, and India <a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42"><small>42</small></a> of her gold.
The empire of Darius was the more secure, in that it was contrary to
its constitutional spirit to innovate on the interior organization of
the distant provinces&mdash;they enjoyed their own national laws and
institutions&mdash;they even retained their monarchs&mdash;they resigned nothing
but their independence and their tribute.  The duty of the satraps was
as yet but civil and financial: they were responsible for the imposts,
they executed the royal decrees.  Their institution was outwardly
designed but for the better collection of the revenue; but when from
the ranks of the nobles Darius rose to the throne, he felt the
advantage of creating subject principalities, calculated at once to
remove and to content the more powerful and ambitious of his former
equals.  Save Darius himself, no monarch in the known world possessed
the dominion or enjoyed the splendour accorded to these imperial
viceroys.  Babylon and Assyria fell to one&mdash;Media was not sufficient
for another&mdash;nation was added to nation, and race to race, to form a
province worthy the nomination of a representative of the great king.
His pomp and state were such as befitted the viceroy over monarchs.  A
measure of silver, exceeding the Attic medimnus, was presented every
day to the satrap of Babylon <a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43"><small>43</small></a>.  Eight hundred stallions and
sixteen thousand mares were apportioned to his stables, and the tax of
four Assyrian towns was to provide for the maintenance of his Indian
dogs.
</p>
<p>
But under Darius, at least, these mighty officers were curbed and kept
in awe by the periodical visits of the king himself, or his
commissioners; while a broad road, from the western coast to the
Persian capital&mdash;inns, that received the messengers, and couriers,
that transmitted the commands of the king, brought the more distant
provinces within the reach of ready intelligence and vigilant control.
These latter improvements were well calculated to quicken the stagnant
languor habitual to the overgrowth of eastern empire.  Nor was the
reign of Darius undistinguished by the cultivation of the more elegant
arts&mdash;since to that period may be referred, if not the foundation, at
least the embellishment and increase of Persepolis.  The remains of
the palace of Chil-Menar, ascribed by modern superstition to the
architecture of genii, its graceful columns, its mighty masonry, its
terrace-flights, its marble basins, its sculptured designs stamped
with the unmistakeable emblems of the magian faith, sufficiently
evince that the shepherd-soldiery of Cyrus had already learned to
appreciate and employ the most elaborate arts of the subjugated Medes.
</p>
<p>
During this epoch, too, was founded a more regular military system, by
the institution of conscriptions&mdash;while the subjection of the skilful
sailors of Phoenicia, and of the great maritime cities of Asiatic
Greece, brought to the Persian warfare the new arm of a numerous and
experienced navy.
</p>
<p>
V.  The reign of Darius is also remarkable for the influence which
Grecian strangers began to assume in the Persian court&mdash;and the fatal
and promiscuous admission of Grecian mercenaries into the Persian
service.  The manners of the Persians were naturally hospitable, and
Darius possessed not only an affable temper, but an inquisitive mind.
A Greek physician of Crotona, who succeeded in relieving the king from
the effects of a painful accident which had baffled the Egyptian
practitioners, esteemed the most skilful the court possessed,
naturally rose into an important personage.  His reputation was
increased by a more difficult cure upon the person of Atossa, the
daughter of Cyrus, who, from the arms of her brother Cambyses, and
those of the magian impostor, passed to the royal marriage-bed.  And
the physician, though desirous only of returning through some pretext
to his own country, perhaps first inflamed the Persian king with the
ill-starred wish of annexing Greece to his dominions.  He despatched a
commission with the physician himself, to report on the affairs of
Greece.  Many Hellenic adventurers were at that time scattered over
the empire, some who had served with Cambyses, others who had sided
with the Egyptians.  Their valour recommended them to a valiant
people, and their singular genius for intrigue took root in every
soil.  Syloson, a Greek of Samos, brother to Polycrates, the tyrant of
that state, who, after a career of unexampled felicity and renown,
fell a victim to the hostile treachery of Oretes, the satrap of
Sardis, induced Darius to send over Otanes at the head of a Persian
force to restore him to the principality of his murdered brother; and
when, subsequently, in his Scythian expedition, Darius was an
eyewitness of the brilliant civilization of Ionia, not only did Greece
become to him more an object of ambition, but the Greeks of his
respect.  He sought, by a munificent and wise clemency, to attach them
to his throne, and to colonize his territories with subjects valuable
alike for their constitutional courage and national intelligence.  Nor
can we wonder at the esteem which a Hippias or a Demaratus found in
the Persian councils, when, in addition to the general reputation of
Greeks, they were invested with the dignity of princely rank&mdash;for,
above all nations <a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44"><small>44</small></a>, the Persians most venerated the name and the
attributes of a king; nor could their Oriental notions have accurately
distinguished between a legitimate monarch and a Greek tyrant.
</p>
<p>
VI.  In this reign, too, as the empire was concentrated, and a
splendid court arose from the warrior camp of Cyrus and Cambyses, the
noble elements of the pure Persian character grew confounded with the
Median and Assyrian.  As the Persians retreated from the manners of a
nomad, they lost the distinction of a conquering people.  Warriors
became courtiers&mdash;the palace shrunk into the seraglio&mdash;eunuchs and
favourites, queens <a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45"><small>45</small></a>, and above all queen-mothers, rose into
pernicious and invisible influence.  And while the Greeks, in their
small states, and under their free governments, progressed to a
civilization, in which luxury only sharpened new energies and created
new arts, the gorgeous enervation of a despotism destructive to
competition, and an empire too vast for patriotism, rapidly debased
and ruined the old hardy race of Cyrus <a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46"><small>46</small></a>, perhaps equal originally
to the Greeks in mental, and in many important points far superior to
them in moral qualities.  With a religion less animated and
picturesque, but more simple and exalted, rejecting the belief that
the gods partook of a mortal nature, worshipping their GREAT ONE not
in statues or in temples, but upon the sublime altar of lofty
mountain-tops&mdash;or through those elementary agents which are the
unidolatrous representatives of his beneficence and power <a href="#note-47" name="noteref-47"><small>47</small></a>;
accustomed, in their primitive and uncorrupted state, to mild laws and
limited authority; inured from childhood to physical discipline and
moral honesty, "to draw the bow and to speak the truth," this gallant
and splendid tribe were fated to make one of the most signal proofs in
history, that neither the talents of a despot nor the original virtues
of a people can long resist the inevitable effect of vicious political
constitutions.  It was not at Marathon, nor at Salamis, nor at
Plataea, that the Persian glory fell.  It fell when the Persians
imitated the manners of the slaves they conquered.  "Most imitative of
all men," says Herodotus, "they are ever ready to adopt the manners of
the foreigners.  They take from the Medes their robe, from the
Egyptians their breastplate."  Happy, if to the robe and the
breastplate they had confined their appropriations from the nations
they despised!  Happy, if they had not imparted to their august
religion the gross adulterations of the Median magi; if they had not
exchanged their mild laws and restricted government, for the most
callous contempt of the value of life <a href="#note-48" name="noteref-48"><small>48</small></a> and the dignity of freedom.
The whole of the pure Persian race, but especially the nobler tribe of
the Pasargadae, became raised by conquest over so vast a population,
to the natural aristocracy of the land.  But the valuable principle of
aristocratic pride, which is the safest curb to monarchic
encroachment, crumbled away in the atmosphere of a despotism, which
received its capricious checks or awful chastisement only in the dark
recesses of a harem.  Retaining to the last their disdain of all
without the Persian pale; deeming themselves still "the most excellent
of mankind;" <a href="#note-49" name="noteref-49"><small>49</small></a> this people, the nobility of the East, with the
arrogance of the Spartan, contracting the vices of the Helot, rapidly
decayed from all their national and ancient virtues beneath that
seraglio-rule of janizaries and harlots, in which, from first to last,
have merged the melancholy destinies of Oriental despotism.
</p>
<p>
VII.  Although Darius seems rather to have possessed the ardour for
conquest than the genius for war, his reign was memorable for many
military triumphs, some cementing, others extending, the foundations
of the empire.  A formidable insurrection of Babylon, which resisted a
siege of twenty-one months, was effectually extinguished, and the new
satrap government, aided by the yearly visits of the king, appears to
have kept from all subsequent reanimation the vast remains of that
ancient empire of the Chaldaean kings.  Subsequently an expedition
along the banks of the Indus, first navigated for discovery by one of
the Greeks whom Darius took into his employ, subjected the highlands
north of the Indus, and gave that distant river as a new boundary to
the Persian realm.  More important, had the fortunes of his son been
equal to his designs, was the alarming settlement which the monarch of
Asia effected on the European continent, by establishing his
sovereignty in Thrace and Macedonia&mdash;by exacting homage from the isles
and many of the cities of Greece&mdash;by breaking up, with the crowning
fall of Miletus, the independence and rising power of those Ionian
colonies, which ought to have established on the Asiatic coasts the
permanent barrier to the irruptions of eastern conquest.  Against
these successes the loss of six thousand four hundred men at the
battle of Marathon, a less number than Darius deliberately sacrificed
in a stratagem at the siege of Babylon, would have seemed but a petty
counterbalance in the despatches of his generals, set off, as it was,
by the spoils and the captives of Euboea.  Nor were the settlements in
Thrace and Macedon, with the awe that his vast armament excited
throughout that portion of his dominions, an insufficient recompense
for the disasters of the expedition, conducted by Darius in person,
against the wandering, fierce, and barbarous Mongolian race, that,
known to us by the name of Scythians, worshipped their war-god under
the symbol of a cimeter, with libations of human blood&mdash;hideous
inhabitants of the inhospitable and barren tracts that interpose
between the Danube and the Don.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Thus the heritage that passed from Darius to Xerxes was the
fruit of a long and, upon the whole, a wise and glorious reign.  The
new sovereign of the East did not, like his father, find a disjointed
and uncemented empire of countries rather conquered than subdued,
destitute alike of regular revenues and local governments; a wandering
camp, shifted to and fro in a wilderness of unconnected nations&mdash;
Xerxes ascended the throne amid a splendid court, with Babylon,
Ecbatana, Persepolis, and Susa for his palaces.  Submissive satraps
united the most distant provinces with the seat of empire.  The wealth
of Asia was borne in regular currents to his treasury.  Save the
revolt of the enfeebled Egyptians, and the despised victory of a
handful of men upon a petty foreland of the remote Aegaean, no cloud
rested upon the dawn of his reign.  As yet unfelt and unforeseen were
the dangers that might ultimately result from the very wisdom of
Darius in the institution of satraps, who, if not sufficiently
supported by military force, would be unable to control the motley
nations over which they presided, and, if so supported, might
themselves become, in any hour, the most formidable rebels.  To
whatever prestige he inherited from the fame of his father, the young
king added, also, a more venerable and sacred dignity in the eyes of
the Persian aristocracy, and, perhaps, throughout the whole empire,
derived, on his mother's side, from the blood of Cyrus.  Never, to all
external appearance, and, to ordinary foresight, under fairer
auspices, did a prince of the East pass from the luxury of a seraglio
to the majesty of a throne.

    CHAPTER V.
</h2>
<p>
Xerxes Conducts an Expedition into Egypt.&mdash;He finally resolves on the
Invasion of Greece.&mdash;Vast Preparations for the Conquest of Europe.&mdash;
Xerxes Arrives at Sardis.&mdash;Despatches Envoys to the Greek States,
demanding Tribute.&mdash;The Bridge of the Hellespont.&mdash;Review of the
Persian Armament at Abydos.&mdash;Xerxes Encamps at Therme.
</p>
<p>
I.  On succeeding to the throne of the East (B. C. 485), Xerxes found
the mighty army collected by his father prepared to execute his
designs of conquest or revenge.  In the greatness of that army, in the
youth of that prince, various parties beheld the instrument of
interest or ambition.  Mardonius, warlike and enterprising, desired
the subjugation of Greece, and the command of the Persian forces.  And
to the nobles of the Pasargadae an expedition into Europe could not
but present a dazzling prospect of spoil and power&mdash;of satrapies as
yet unexhausted of treasure&mdash;of garrisons and troops remote from the
eye of the monarch, and the domination of the capital.
</p>
<p>
The persons who had most influence over Xerxes were his uncle
Artabanus, his cousin Mardonius, and a eunuch named Natacas <a href="#note-50" name="noteref-50"><small>50</small></a>.  The
intrigues of the party favourable to the invasion of Europe were
backed by the representations of the Grecian exiles.  The family and
partisans of the Pisistratidae had fixed themselves in Susa, and the
Greek subtlety and spirit of enterprise maintained and confirmed, for
that unprincipled and able faction, the credit they had already
established at the Persian court.  Onomacritus, an Athenian priest,
formerly banished by Hipparchus for forging oracular predictions, was
now reconciled to the Pisistratidae, and resident at Susa.  Presented
to the king as a soothsayer and prophet, he inflamed the ambition of
Xerxes by garbled oracles of conquest and fortune, which, this time,
it was not the interest of the Pisistratidae to expose.
</p>
<p>
About the same period the Aleuadae, those princes of Thessaly whose
policy seems ever to have been that of deadly hostility to the Grecian
republics, despatched ambassadors to Xerxes, inviting him to Greece,
and promising assistance to his arms, and allegiance to his sceptre.
</p>
<p>
II.  From these intrigues Xerxes aroused himself in the second year of
his reign, and, as the necessary commencement of more extended
designs, conducted in person an expedition against the rebellious
Egyptians.  That people had neither military skill nor constitutional
hardihood, but they were inspired with the most devoted affection for
their faith and their institutions.  This affection was to them what
the love of liberty is in others&mdash;it might be easy to conquer them, it
was almost impossible to subdue.  By a kind of fatality their history,
for centuries, was interwoven with that of Greece: their perils and
their enemies the same.  The ancient connexion which apocryphal
tradition recorded between races so opposite, seemed a typical
prophecy of that which actually existed in the historical times.  And
if formerly Greece had derived something of civilization from Egypt,
she now paid back the gift by the swords of her adventurers; and the
bravest and most loyal part of the Egyptian army was composed of
Grecian mercenaries.  At the same time Egypt shared the fate of all
nations that intrust too great a power to auxiliaries.  Greeks
defended her, but Greeks conspired against her.  The adventurers from
whom she derived a fatal strength were of a vain, wily, and irritable
temperament.  A Greek removed from the influence of Greece usually
lost all that was honest, all that was noble in the national
character; and with the most refining intellect, he united a policy
like that of the Italian in the middle ages, fierce, faithless, and
depraved.  Thus, while the Greek auxiliaries under Amasis, or rather
Psammenitus, resisted to the last the arms of Cambyses, it was by a
Greek (Phanes) that Egypt had been betrayed.  Perhaps, could we
thoroughly learn all the secret springs of the revolt of Egypt, and
the expedition of Xerxes, we might find a coincidence not of dates
alone between Grecian and Egyptian affairs.  Whether in Memphis or in
Susa, it is wonderful to see the amazing influence and ascendency
which the Hellenic intellect obtained.  It was in reality the
desperate refuse of Europe that swayed the councils, moved the armies,
and decided the fate of the mighty dynasties of the East.
</p>
<p>
III.  The arms of Xerxes were triumphant in Egypt (B. C. 484), and he
more rigorously enforced upon that ill-fated land the iron despotism
commenced by Cambyses.  Intrusting the Egyptian government to his
brother Achaemenes, the Persian king returned to Susa, and flushed
with his victory, and more and more influenced by the ambitious
counsels of Mardonius, he now fairly opened, in the full divan of his
counsellors, the vast project he had conceived.  The vanity of the
Greeks led them too credulously to suppose that the invasion of Greece
was the principal object of the great king; on the contrary, it was
the least.  He regarded Greece but as the threshold of a new quarter
of the globe.  Ignorant of the nature of the lands he designed to
subject, and credulous of all the fables which impart proverbial
magnificence to the unknown, Xerxes saw in Europe "regions not
inferior to Asia in extent, and far surpassing it in fertility."
After the conquest of Greece on either continent, the young monarch
unfolded to his counsellors his intention of overrunning the whole of
Europe, "until heaven itself should be the only limit to the Persian
realm, and the sun should shine on no country contiguous to his own."
<a href="#note-51" name="noteref-51"><small>51</small></a>
</p>
<p>
IV.  These schemes, supported by Mardonius, were opposed only by
Artabanus; and the arguments of the latter, dictated by prudence and
experience, made considerable impression upon the king.  From that
time, however, new engines of superstitious craft and imposture were
brought to bear upon the weak mind, on whose decision now rested the
fatal war between Asia and Europe.  Visions and warnings, threats and
exhortations, haunted his pillow and disturbed his sleep, all tending
to one object, the invasion of Greece.  As we learn from Ctesias that
the eunuch Natacas was one of the parasites most influential with
Xerxes, it is probable that so important a personage in the intrigues
of a palace was, with the evident connivance of the magi, the
instrument of Mardonius.  And, indeed, from this period the politics
of Persia became more and more concentrated in the dark plots of the
seraglio.  Thus superstition, flattery, ambition, all operating upon
him, the irresolution of Xerxes vanished.  Artabanus himself affected
to be convinced of the expediency of the war; and the only object now
remaining to the king and his counsellors was to adapt the
preparations to the magnitude of the enterprise.  Four additional
years were not deemed an idle delay in collecting an army and fleet
destined to complete the conquest of the world.
</p>
<p>
"And never," says Herodotus, "was there a military expedition
comparable to this.  Hard would it be to specify one nation of Asia
which did not accompany the Persian king, or any waters, save the
great rivers, which were not exhausted by his armament."  Preparations
for an expedition of three years were made, to guard against the
calamities formerly sustained by the Persian fleet.  Had the success
of the expedition been commensurate with the grandeur of its
commencement, perhaps it would have ranked among the sublimest
conceptions of military genius.  All its schemes were of a vast and
gigantic nature.  Across the isthmus, which joins the promontory of
Athos to the Thracian continent, a canal was formed&mdash;a work of so
enormous a labour, that it seems almost to have justified the
skepticism of later writers <a href="#note-52" name="noteref-52"><small>52</small></a>, but for the concurrent testimony of
Thucydides and Lysias, Plato, Herodotus, and Strabo.
</p>
<p>
Bridges were also thrown over the river Strymon; the care of
provisions was intrusted to the Egyptians and Phoenicians, and stores
were deposited in every station that seemed the best adapted for
supplies.
</p>
<p>
V.  While these preparations were carried on, the great king, at the
head of his land-forces, marched to Sardis.  Passing the river Halys,
and the frontiers of Lydia, he halted at Celaenae.  Here he was
magnificently entertained by Pythius, a Lydian, esteemed, next to the
king himself, the richest of mankind.  This wealthy subject proffered
to the young prince, in prosecution of the war, the whole of his
treasure, amounting to two thousand talents of silver, and four
millions, wanting only seven thousand, of golden staters of Darius
<a href="#note-53" name="noteref-53"><small>53</small></a>. "My farms and my slaves," he added, "will be sufficient to
maintain me."
</p>
<p>
"My friend," said the royal guest, who possessed all the irregular
generosity of princes, "you are the first person, since I left Persia
(B. C. 480), who has treated my army with hospitality and voluntarily
offered me assistance in the war.  Accept my friendship; I receive you
as my host; retain your possessions, and permit me to supply the seven
thousand staters which are wanting to complete the four millions you
already possess."  A man who gives from the property of the public is
seldom outdone in munificence.
</p>
<p>
At length Xerxes arrived at Sardis, and thence he despatched heralds
into Greece (close of B. C. 481), demanding the tribute of earth and
water.  Athens and Sparta were the only cities not visited by his
envoys.
</p>
<p>
VI.  While Xerxes rested at the Lydian city, an enterprise, scarcely
less magnificent in conception than that of the canal at Athos, was
completed at the sacred passage of the Hellespont.  Here was
constructed from the coast of Asia to that of Europe a bridge of
boats, for the convoy of the army.  Scarce was this completed when a
sudden tempest scattered the vessels, and rendered the labour vain.
The unruly passion of the high-spirited despot was popularly said to
have evinced itself at this intelligence, by commanding the Hellespont
to receive three hundred lashes and a pair of fetters&mdash;a story
recorded as a certainty by Herodotus, and more properly contemned as a
fable by modern skepticism.
</p>
<p>
A new bridge was now constructed under new artificers, whose industry
was sharpened by the fate of their unfortunate predecessors, whom
Xerxes condemned to death.  These architects completed at last two
bridges of vessels, of various kinds and sizes, secured by anchors of
great length, and thus protected from the influence of the winds that
set in from the Euxine on the one hand, and the south and southeast
winds on the other.  The elaborate description of this work given by
Herodotus proves it to have been no clumsy or unartist-like
performance.  The ships do not appear so much to have formed the
bridge, as to have served for piers to support its weight.  Rafters of
wood, rough timber, and layers of earth were placed across extended
cables, and the whole was completed by a fence on either side, that
the horses and beasts of burden might not be frightened by the sight
of the open sea.
</p>
<p>
VII.  And now the work was finished (B. C. 480), the winter was past,
and at the dawn of returning spring, Xerxes led his armament from
Sardis to Abydos.  As the multitude commenced their march, it is said
that the sun was suddenly overcast, and an abrupt and utter darkness
crept over the face of heaven.  The magi were solemnly consulted at
the omen; and they foretold, that by the retirement of the sun, the
tutelary divinity of the Greeks, was denoted the withdrawal of the
protection of Heaven from that fated nation.  The answer pleased the
king.
</p>
<p>
On they swept&mdash;the conveyance of the baggage, and a vast promiscuous
crowd of all nations, preceding; behind, at a considerable interval,
came the flower of the Persian army&mdash;a thousand horse&mdash;a thousand
spearmen&mdash;the ten sacred steeds, called Nisaean&mdash;the car of the great
Persian god, drawn by eight snow-white horses, and in which no mortal
ever dared to seat himself.  Around the person of Xerxes were spearmen
and cavalry, whose arms glittered with gold&mdash;the ten thousand infantry
called "The Immortals," of whom nine thousand bore pomegranates of
silver at the extremity of their lances, and one thousand pomegranates
of gold.  Ten thousand horsemen followed these: and far in the rear,
the gorgeous procession closed with the mighty multitude of the
general army.
</p>
<p>
The troops marched along the banks of the Caicus&mdash;over the plains of
Thebes;&mdash;and passing Mount Ida to the left, above whose hoary crest
broke a storm of thunder and lightning, they arrived at the golden
Scamander, whose waters failed the invading thousands.  Here it is
poetically told of Xerxes, that he ascended the citadel of Priam, and
anxiously and carefully surveyed the place, while the magi of the
barbarian monarch directed libations to the manes of the Homeric
heroes.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Arrived at Abydos, the king reviewed his army.  High upon an
eminence, and on a seat of white marble, he surveyed the plains
covered with countless thousands, and the Hellespont crowded with
sails and masts.  At first, as he gazed, the lord of Persia felt all
the pride and exultation which the command over so many destinies was
calculated to inspire.  But a sad and sudden thought came over him in
the midst of his triumphs, and he burst into tears.  "I reflect," said
he to Artabanus, "on the transitory limit of human life.  I
compassionate this vast multitude&mdash;a hundred years hence, which of
them will still be a living man?"  Artabanus replied like a
philosopher, "that the shortness of life was not its greatest evil;
that misfortune and disease imbittered the possession, and that death
was often the happiest refuge of the living." <a href="#note-54" name="noteref-54"><small>54</small></a>
</p>
<p>
At early daybreak, while the army yet waited the rising of the sun,
they burnt perfumes on the bridge, and strewed it with branches of the
triumphal myrtle.  As the sun lifted himself above the east, Xerxes
poured a libation into the sea, and addressing the rising orb,
implored prosperity to the Persian arms, until they should have
vanquished the whole of Europe, even to the remotest ends.  Then
casting the cup, with a Persian cimeter, into the sea, the signal was
given for the army to commence the march.  Seven days and seven nights
were consumed in the passage of that prodigious armament.
</p>
<p>
IX.  Thus entering Europe, Xerxes proceeded to Doriscus (a wide plain
of Thrace, commanded by a Persian garrison), where he drew up, and
regularly numbered his troops; the fleets ranged in order along the
neighbouring coast.  The whole amount of the land-force, according to
Herodotus, was 1,700,000.  Later writers have been skeptical as to
this vast number, but without sufficient grounds for their disbelief.
There were to be found the soldiery of many nations:&mdash;the Persians in
tunics and scale breastplates, the tiara helmet of the Medes, the
arrows, and the large bow which was their natural boast and weapon;
there were the Medes similarly equipped; and the Assyrians, with
barbarous helmets, linen cuirasses, and huge clubs tipped with iron;
the Bactrians with bows of reeds, and the Scythian Sacae, with their
hatchets and painted crests.  There, too, were the light-clothed
Indians, the Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, Gandarians, and the
Dadicae.  There were the Caspians, clad in tough hides, with bows and
cimeters; the gorgeous tunics of the Sarangae, and the loose flowing
vests (or zirae) of the Arabians.  There were seen the negroes of
Aethiopian Nubia with palm bows four cubits long, arrows pointed with
flint, and vestures won from the leopard and the lion; a barbarous
horde, who, after the wont of savages, died their bodies with gypsum
and vermilion when they went to war; while the straight-haired Asiatic
Aethiopians wore the same armour as the Indians whom they bordered.
save that their helmets were formed of the skin of the horse's head
<a href="#note-55" name="noteref-55"><small>55</small></a>, on which the mane was left in the place of plumage.  The Libyans
were among the horde, and the buskined Paphlagonians, with helms of
network; and the Cappadocian Syrians; and the Phrygians; and the
Armenians; the Lydians, equipped similarly to the Greeks; the
Strymonian Thracians, clad in tunics, below which were flowing robes
like the Arabian zirae or tartan, but of various colours, and buskins
of the skins of fawns&mdash;armed with the javelin and the dagger; the
Thracians, too, of Asia, with helmets of brass wrought with the ears
and horns of an ox; the people from the islands of the Red Sea, armed
and people like Medes; the Mares, and the Colchians, and the Moschi,
and other tribes, tedious to enumerate, swelled and diversified the
force of Xerxes.
</p>
<p>
Such were the infantry of the Persian army, forgetting not the ten
thousand chosen Persians, called the Immortal Band <a href="#note-56" name="noteref-56"><small>56</small></a>, whose armour
shone with profuse gold, and who were distinguished even in war by
luxury&mdash;carriages for their women, troops of attendants, and camels
and beasts of burden.
</p>
<p>
Besides these were the Persian cavalry; the nomad Sagartii, who
carried with them nooses, in which they sought to entangle their foe;
the Medes and the Indian horse, which last had also chariots of war
drawn by steeds or wild asses; the Bactrians and Caspians, equipped
alike; the Africans, who fought from chariots; the Paricanians; and
the Arabians with their swift dromedaries, completed the forces of the
cavalry, which amounted to eighty thousand, exclusive even of chariots
and the camels.
</p>
<p>
Nor was the naval unworthy of the land armada.  The number of the
triremes was one thousand two hundred and seven.  Of these the
Phoenicians and the Syrians of Palestine furnished three hundred, the
serving-men with breastplates of linen, javelins, bucklers without
bosses, and helmets fashioned nearly similarly to those of the Greeks;
two hundred vessels were supplied by the Egyptians, armed with huge
battle-axes, and casques of network; one hundred and fifty vessels
came from Cyprus, and one hundred from Cilicia; those who manned the
first differing in arms from the Greeks only in the adoption of the
tunic, and the Median mitres worn by the chiefs&mdash;those who manned the
last, with two spears, and tunics of wool.  The Pamphylians, clad as
the Greeks, contributed thirty vessels, and fifty also were manned by
Lycians with mantles of goat-skin and unfeathered arrows of reed.  In
thirty vessels came the Dorians of Asia; in seventy the Carians, and
in a hundred, the subjugated Ionians.  The Grecian Isles between the
Cyaneae, and the promontories of Triopium and Sunium <a href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"><small>57</small></a>, furnished
seventeen vessels, and the Aeolians sixty.  The inhabitants of the
Hellespont (those of Abydos alone excepted, who remained to defend the
bridges) combined with the people of Pontus to supply a hundred more.
In each vessel were detachments of Medes, Persians, and Saci; the best
mariners were the Phoenicians, especially those of Sidon.  The
commanders-in-chief of the sea-forces were Ariabignes (son of Darius),
Prexaspes, Megabazus (son of Megabates), and Achaemenes (brother of
Xerxes, and satrap of Egypt).
</p>
<p>
Of the infantry, the generals were Mardonius, Tritantaechmes, son of
Artabanus, and Smerdones (cousin to Xerxes), Maistes (his brother),
Gergis, and Megabazus, son of that celebrated Zopyrus, through whom
Darius possessed himself of Babylon. <a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58"><small>58</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Harmamithres and Tithaeus, who were Medes, commanded the cavalry; a
third leader, Pharnouches, died in consequence of a fall from his
horse.  But the name of a heroine, more masculine than her colleagues,
must not be omitted: Artemisia, widow to one of the Carian kings,
furnished five ships (the best in the fleet next to those of Sidon),
which she commanded in person, celebrated alike for a dauntless
courage and a singular wisdom.
</p>
<p>
X.  Such were the forces which the great king reviewed, passing
through the land-forces in his chariot, and through the fleet in a
Sidonian vessel, beneath a golden canopy.  After his survey, the king
summoned Demaratus to his presence.
</p>
<p>
"Think you," said he, "that the Greeks will presume to resist me?"
</p>
<p>
"Sire," answered the Spartan, "your proposition of servitude will be
rejected by the Greeks; and even if the rest of them sided with you,
Lacedaemon still would give you battle; question not in what numbers;
had Sparta but a thousand men she would oppose you."
</p>
<p>
Marching onward, and forcibly enlisting, by the way, various tribes
through which he passed, exhausting many streams, and empoverishing
the population condemned to entertain his army, Xerxes arrived at
Acanthus: there he dismissed the commanders of his fleet, ordering
them to wait his orders at Therme, a small town which gave its name to
the Thermean Gulf (to which they proceeded, pressing ships and seamen
by the way), and afterward, gaining Therme himself, encamped his army
on the coast, spreading far and wide its multitudinous array from
Therme and Mygdonia to the rivers Lydias and Haliacmon.

</p>
<p>
I.  The first preparations of the Persians did not produce the effect
which might have been anticipated in the Grecian states.  Far from
uniting against the common foe, they still cherished a frivolous and
unreasonable jealousy of each other.  Several readily sent the symbols
of their allegiance to the Persian, including the whole of Boeotia,
except only the Thespians and Plataeans.  The more timorous states
imagined themselves safe from the vengeance of the barbarian; the more
resolute were overwhelmed with dismay.  The renown of the Median arms
was universally acknowledged for in spite of Marathon, Greece had not
yet learned to despise the foreigner; and the enormous force of the
impending armament was accurately known from the spies and deserters
of the Grecian states, who abounded in the barbarian camp.  Even
united, the whole navy of Greece seemed insufficient to contend
against such a foe; and, divided among themselves, several of the
states were disposed rather to succumb than to resist <a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59"><small>59</small></a>.  "And
here," says the father of history, "I feel compelled to assert an
opinion, however invidious it may be to many.  If the Athenians,
terrified by the danger, had forsaken their country, or submitted to
the Persian, Xerxes would have met with no resistance by sea.  The
Lacedaemonians, deserted by their allies, would have died with honour
or yielded from necessity, and all Greece have been reduced to the
Persian yoke.  The Athenians were thus the deliverers of Greece.  They
animated the ardour of those states yet faithful to themselves; and,
next to the gods, they were the true repellers of the invader.  Even
the Delphic oracles, dark and ominous as they were, did not shake
their purpose, nor induce them to abandon Greece."  When even the
deities themselves seemed doubtful, Athens was unshaken.  The
messengers despatched by the Athenians to the Delphic oracle received
indeed an answer well calculated to appal them.
</p>
<p>
"Unhappy men," cried the priestess, "leave your houses and the
ramparts of the city, and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth.
Fire and keen Mars, compelling the Syrian chariot, shall destroy,
towers shall be overthrown, and temples destroyed by fire.  Lo! now,
even now, they stand dropping sweat, and their house-tops black with
blood, and shaking with prophetic awe.  Depart and prepare for ill!"
</p>
<p>
II.  Cast into the deepest affliction by this response, the Athenians
yet, with the garb and symbols of suppliants, renewed their
application.  "Answer us," they said, "oh supreme God, answer us more
propitiously, or we will not depart from your sanctuary, but remain
here even until death."
</p>
<p>
The second answer seemed less severe than the first: "Minerva is
unable to appease the Olympian Jupiter.  Again, therefore, I speak,
and my words are as adamant.  All else within the bounds of Cecropia
and the bosom of the divine Cithaeron shall fall and fail you.  The
wooden wall alone Jupiter grants to Pallas, a refuge to your children
and yourselves.  Wait not for horse and foot&mdash;tarry not the march of
the mighty army&mdash;retreat, even though they close upon you.  Oh Salamis
the divine, thou shalt lose the sons of women, whether Ceres scatter
or hoard her harvest!"
</p>
<p>
III.  Writing down this reply, the messengers returned to Athens.
Many and contradictory were the attempts made to interpret the
response; some believed that by a wooden wall was meant the citadel,
formerly surrounded by a palisade of wood.  Others affirmed that the
enigmatical expression signified the fleet.  But then the concluding
words perplexed them.  For the apostrophe to Salamis appeared to
denote destruction and defeat.  At this juncture Themistocles approved
himself worthy of the position he had attained.  It is probable that
he had purchased the oracle to which he found a ready and bold
solution.  He upheld the resort to the ships, but denied that in the
apostrophe to Salamis any evil to Athens was denounced.  "Had," said
he, "the prediction of loss and slaughter referred to the Athenians,
would Salamis have been called 'divine?' would it not have been rather
called the 'wretched' if the Greeks were doomed to perish near that
isle?  The oracle threatens not the Athenians, but the enemy.  Let us
prepare then to engage the barbarian by sea.  Our ships are our wooden
walls."
</p>
<p>
This interpretation, as it was the more encouraging, so it was the
more approved.  The vessels already built from the revenues of the
mines of Laurion were now destined to the safety of Greece.
</p>
<p>
IV.  It was, however, before the arrival of the Persian envoys <a href="#note-60" name="noteref-60"><small>60</small></a>,
and when the Greeks first woke to the certainty, that the vast
preparations of Xerxes menaced Greece as the earliest victim, that a
congress, perhaps at the onset confined to the Peloponnesian states,
met at Corinth.  At the head of this confederate council necessarily
ranked Sparta, which was the master state of the Peloponnesus.  But in
policy and debate, if not in arms, she appears always to have met with
a powerful rival in Corinth, the diplomacy of whose wealthy and
liberal commonwealth often counteracted the propositions of the
Spartan delegates.  To this congress subsequently came the envoys of
all the states that refused tribute and homage to the Persian king.
The institution of this Hellenic council, which was one cause of the
salvation of Greece, is a proof of the political impotence of the old
Amphictyonic league.  The Synedrion of Corinth (or rather of that
Corinthian village that had grown up round the temple of Neptune, and
is styled the ISTHMUS by the Greek writers) was the true historical
Amphictyony of Hellas.
</p>
<p>
In the Isthmian congress the genius of Themistocles found an ampler
sphere than it had hitherto done among the noisy cabals of Athens.  Of
all the Greek delegates, that sagacious statesman was most successful
in accomplishing the primary object of the confederacy, viz., in
removing the jealousies and the dissensions that hitherto existed
among the states which composed it.  In this, perhaps the most
difficult, as the most essential, task, Themistocles was aided by a
Tegean, named Chileus, who, though he rarely appears upon the external
stage of action, seems to have been eminently skilled in the intricate
and entangled politics of the time.  Themistocles, into whose hands
the Athenian republic, at this period, confided the trust not more of
its interests than its resentments, set the example of concord; and
Athens, for a while, consented to reconciliation and amity with the
hated Aegina.  All the proceedings of this illustrious congress were
characterized by vigilant prudence and decisive energy.  As soon as
Xerxes arrived in Sardis, emissaries were despatched to watch the
movements of the Persian army, and at the same period, or rather some
time before <a href="#note-61" name="noteref-61"><small>61</small></a>, ambassadors were sent to Corcyra, Crete, Argos, and
to Syracuse, then under the dominion of Gelo.  This man, from the
station of a high-born and powerful citizen of Gela, in Sicily, had
raised himself, partly by military talents, principally by a profound
and dissimulating policy, to the tyranny of Gela and of Syracuse.  His
abilities were remarkable, his power great; nor on the Grecian
continent was there one state that could command the force and the
resources that were at the disposal of the Syracusan prince.
</p>
<p>
The spies despatched to Sardis were discovered, seized, and would have
been put to death, but for the interference of Xerxes, who dismissed
them, after directing them to be led round his army, in the hope that
their return from the terror of such a spectacle would, more than
their death, intimidate and appal their countrymen.
</p>
<p>
The mission to Argos, which, as a Peloponnesian city, was one of the
earliest applied to, was unsuccessful.  That state still suffered the
exhaustion which followed the horrible massacre perpetrated by
Cleomenes, the Spartan king, who had burnt six thousand Argives in the
precincts of the sanctuary to which they had fled.  New changes of
government had followed this fatal loss, and the servile population
had been enabled to seize the privileges of the free.  Thus, hatred to
Sparta, a weakened soldiery, an unsettled internal government, all
conspired to render Argos lukewarm to the general cause.  Yet that
state did not openly refuse the aid which it secretly resolved to
withhold.  It consented to join the common league upon two conditions;
an equal share with the Spartans in the command, and a truce of thirty
years with those crafty and merciless neighbours.  The Spartans
proposed to compromise the former condition, by allowing to the Argive
king not indeed half the command, but a voice equal to that of each of
their own kings.  To the latter condition they offered no objection.
Glad of an excuse to retaliate on the Spartans their own haughty
insolence, the Argives at once rejected the proposition, and ordered
the Spartan ambassador to quit their territories before sunset.  But
Argos, though the chief city of Argolis, had not her customary
influence over the other towns of that district, in which the
attachment to Greece was stronger than the jealous apprehensions of
Sparta.
</p>
<p>
The embassy to Sicily was not more successful than that to Argos.
Gelo agreed indeed to furnish the allies with a considerable force,
but only on the condition of obtaining for Sicily the supreme command,
either of the land-force claimed by Sparta, or of the naval force to
which Athens already ventured to pretend; an offer to which it was
impossible that the Greeks should accede, unless they were disposed to
surrender to the craft of an auxiliary the liberties they asserted
against the violence of a foe.  The Spartan and the Athenian
ambassadors alike, and with equal indignation, rejected the proposals
of Gelo, who, in fact, had obtained the tyranny of his native city by
first securing the command of the Gelan cavalry.  The prince of
Syracuse was little affected by the vehement scorn of the ambassadors.
"I see you are in more want of troops than commanders," said he,
wittily.  "Return, then; tell the Greeks this year will be without its
spring."  For, as the spring to the year did Gelo consider his
assistance to Greece.  From Sicily the ambassadors repaired to
Corcyra.  Here they were amused with flattering promises, but the
governors of that intriguing and factious state fitted out a fleet of
sixty vessels, stationed near Pylos, off the coast of Sparta, to wait
the issue of events assuring Xerxes, on the one hand, of their
indisposition to oppose him, and pretending afterward to the Greeks,
on the other, that the adverse winds alone prevented their taking
share in the engagement at Salamis.  The Cretans were not more
disposed to the cause than the Corcyraeans; they found an excuse in an
oracle of Delphi, and indeed that venerable shrine appears to have
been equally dissuasive of resistance to all the states that consulted
it; although the daring of the Athenians had construed the ambiguous
menace into a favourable omen.  The threats of superstition become but
incitements to courage when interpreted by the brave.
</p>
<p>
V.  And now the hostile army had crossed the Hellespont, and the
Thessalians, perceiving that they were the next objects of attack,
despatched ambassadors to the congress at the Isthmus.
</p>
<p>
Those Thessalian chiefs called the Aleuadae had, it is true, invited
Xerxes to the invasion of Greece.  But precisely because acceptable to
the chiefs, the arrival of the great king was dreaded by the people.
By the aid of the Persians, the Aleuadae trusted to extend their power
over their own country&mdash;an ambition with which it is not to be
supposed that the people they assisted to subject would sympathize.
Accordingly, while Xerxes was to the chiefs an ally, to the people he
remained a foe.
</p>
<p>
These Thessalian envoys proclaimed their willingness to assist the
confederates in the defence of their fatherland, but represented the
imminence of the danger to Thessaly, and demanded an immediate supply
of forces.  "Without this," they said, "we cannot exert ourselves for
you, and our inability to assist you will be our excuse, if we provide
for our own safety."
</p>
<p>
Aroused by these exhortations, the confederates commenced their
military movements.  A body of infantry passed the Euripus, entered
Thessaly, and encamped amid the delights of the vale of Tempe.  Here
their numbers, in all ten thousand heavy-armed troops, were joined by
the Thessalian horse.  The Spartans were led by Euaenetus.
Themistocles commanded the Athenians.  The army did not long, however,
remain in the encampment.  Alexander, the king of Macedon, sent
confidentially advising their retreat, and explaining accurately the
force of the enemy.  This advice concurred with the discovery that
there was another passage into Thessaly through the higher regions of
Macedonia, which exposed them to be taken in the rear.  And, in truth,
it was through this passage that the Persian army ultimately marched.
The Greeks, therefore, broke up the camp and returned to the Isthmus.
The Thessalians, thus abandoned, instantly treated with the invader,
and became among the stanchest allies of Xerxes.
</p>
<p>
It was now finally agreed in the Isthmian congress, that the most
advisable plan would be to defend the pass of Thermopylae, as being
both nearer and narrower than that of Thessaly.  The fleet they
resolved to send to Artemisium, on the coast of Histiaeotis, a place
sufficiently neighbouring Thermopylae to allow of easy communication.
Never, perhaps, have the Greeks shown more military skill than in the
choice of these stations.  But one pass in those mountainous districts
permitted the descent of the Persian army from Thessaly, bounded to
the west by steep and inaccessible cliffs, extending as far as Mount
Oeta; to the east by shoals and the neighbouring sea.  This defile
received its name Thermopylae, or Hot Gates, from the hot-springs
which rose near the base of the mountain.  In remote times the
pastoral Phocians had fortified the place against the incursions of
the Thessalians, and the decayed remains of the wall and gates of
their ancient garrison were still existent in the middle of the pass;
while, by marsh and morass, to render the place yet more impassable,
they had suffered the hot-springs to empty themselves along the plain,
on the Thessalian side, and the quagmire was still sodden and
unsteady.  The country on either side the Thermopylae was so
contracted, that before, near the river Phoenix, and behind, near the
village of Alpeni, was at that time space only for a single chariot.
In such a pass the numbers and the cavalry of the Mede were rendered
unavailable; while at the distance of about fifteen miles from
Thermopylae the ships of the Grecian navy rode in the narrow sea, off
the projecting shores of Euboea, equally fortunate in a station which
weakened the force of numbers and allowed the facility of retreat.
</p>
<p>
The sea-station was possessed by the allied ships.  Corinth sent
forty; Megara twenty; Aegina eighteen; Sicyon twelve; Sparta ten; the
Epidaurians contributed eight; the Eretrians seven; the Troezenians
five; the Ityraeans and the people of Ceos each two, and the Opuntian
Locrians seven vessels of fifty oars.  The total of these ships
(without reckoning those of fifty oars, supplied by the Locrians, and
two barks of the same description, which added to the quota sent by
the people of Ceos) amount to one hundred and twenty-four.  The
Athenian force alone numbered more vessels than all the other
confederates, and contributed one hundred and twenty-seven triremes,
partly manned by Plataeans, besides twenty vessels lent to the
Chalcidians, who equipped and manned them.  The Athenian fleet was
commanded by Themistocles.  The land-force at Thermopylae consisted
chiefly of Peloponnesians; its numbers were as follows:&mdash;three hundred
heavy-armed Spartans; five hundred Tegeans; five hundred Mantinaeans;
one hundred and twenty Orchomenians; one thousand from the other
states of Arcady; two hundred from Phlius; eighty from Mycenae.
Boeotia contributed seven hundred Thespians, and four hundred Thebans;
the last had been specially selected by Leonidas, the Spartan chief,
because of the general suspicion that the Thebans were attached to the
Medes, and he desired, therefore, to approve them as friends, or know
them as foes.  Although the sentiments of the Thebans were hostile,
says Herodotus, they sent the assistance required.  In addition to
these, were one thousand Phocians, and a band of the Opuntian
Locrians, unnumbered by Herodotus, but variously estimated, by
Diodorus at one thousand, and, more probably, by Pausanias at no less
than seven thousand.
</p>
<p>
The chief command was intrusted, according to the claims of Sparta, to
Leonidas, the younger brother of the frantic Cleomenes <a href="#note-62" name="noteref-62"><small>62</small></a>, by a
different mother, and his successor to the Spartan throne.
</p>
<p>
There are men whose whole life is in a single action.  Of these,
Leonidas is the most eminent.  We know little of him, until the last
few days of his career.  He seems, as it were, born but to show how
much glory belongs to a brave death.  Of his character or genius, his
general virtues and vices, his sorrows and his joys, biography can
scarcely gather even the materials for conjecture.  He passed from an
obscure existence into an everlasting name.  And history dedicates her
proudest pages to one of whom she has nothing but the epitaph to
relate.
</p>
<p>
As if to contrast the little band under the command of Leonidas,
Herodotus again enumerates the Persian force, swelled as it now was by
many contributions, forced and voluntary, since its departure from
Doriscus.  He estimates the total by sea and land, thus augmented, at
two millions six hundred and forty-one thousand six hundred and ten
fighting men, and computes the number of the menial attendants, the
motley multitude that followed the armament, at an equal number; so
that the son of Darius conducted, hitherto without disaster, to Sepias
and Thermopylae, a body of five millions two hundred and eighty-three
thousand two hundred and twenty human beings <a href="#note-63" name="noteref-63"><small>63</small></a>.  And out of this
wondrous concourse, none in majesty and grace of person, says
Herodotus, surpassed the royal leader.  But such advantages as belong
to superior stature, the kings of Persia obtained by artificial means;
and we learn from Xenophon that they wore a peculiar kind of shoe so
constructed as to increase their height.
</p>
<p>
VI.  The fleet of Xerxes, moving from Therme, obtained some partial
success at sea: ten of their vessels despatched to Sciathos, captured
a guard-ship of Troezene, and sacrificed upon the prow a Greek named
Leon; the beauty of his person obtained him that disagreeable
preference.  A vessel of Aegina fell also into their hands, the crew
of which they treated as slaves, save only one hero, Pytheas, endeared
even to the enemy by his valour; a third vessel, belonging to the
Athenians, was taken at the mouth of the Peneus; the seamen, however,
had previously debarked, and consequently escaped.  Beacons apprized
the Greek station at Artemisium of these disasters, and the fleet
retreated for a while to Chalcis, with a view of guarding the Euripus.
But a violent storm off the coast of Magnesia suddenly destroying no
less than four hundred of the barbarian vessels, with a considerable
number of men and great treasure, the Grecian navy returned to
Artemisium.
</p>
<p>
Here they soon made a capture of fifteen of the Persian vessels,
which, taking them for friends, sailed right into the midst of them.
With this exception, the rest of the barbarian fleet arrived safely at
Aphetae.
</p>
<p>
VII.  Meanwhile the mighty land-force of the great king, passing
through Thessaly and Achaia, arrived at last at the wide Trachinian
plains, which, stretching along the shores of Thessaly, forty miles in
circumference, and adjacent to the straits of Thermopylae, allowed
space for the encampment of his army.
</p>
<p>
The Greeks at Thermopylae beheld the approach of Xerxes with dismay;
they had anticipated considerable re-enforcements from the confederate
states, especially Sparta, which last had determined to commit all her
strength to the campaign, leaving merely a small detachment for the
defence of the capital.  But the Carneian festival in honour of the
great Dorian Apollo, at Sparta, detained the Lacedaemonians, and the
Olympic games diverted the rest of the allies, not yet expecting an
immediate battle.
</p>
<p>
The vicinity of Xerxes, the absence of the re-enforcements they
expected, produced an alarmed and anxious council; Leonidas dissuaded
the confederates from retreat, and despatched messengers to the
various states, urging the necessity of supplies, and stating the
hopelessness of opposing the Mede effectually with the present forces.
</p>
<p>
Xerxes, in the meanwhile, who had heard that an insignificant band
were assembled under a Spartan descendant of Hercules, to resist his
progress, despatched a spy to reconnoitre their number and their
movements.  The emissary was able only to inspect those without the
intrenchment, who, at that time, happened to be the Spartans; he found
that singular race engaged in gymnastic exercises, and dressing their
long hair for the festival of battle.  Although they perceived the
spy, they suffered him to gaze at his leisure, and he returned in
safety to the king.
</p>
<p>
Much astonished at the account he received, Xerxes sent for Demaratus,
and detailing to him what the messenger had seen, inquired what it
might portend, and whether this handful of men amusing themselves in
the defile could seriously mean to resist his arms.
</p>
<p>
"Sire," answered the Spartan, "it is their intention to dispute the
pass, and what your messenger has seen proves that they are preparing
accordingly.  It is the custom of the Spartans to adorn their hair on
the eve of any enterprise of danger.  You are advancing to attack the
flower of the Grecian valour."  Xerxes, still incredulous that
opposition could be seriously intended, had the courtesy to wait four
days to give the enemy leisure to retreat; in the interim he
despatched a messenger to Leonidas, demanding his arms.  "Come and
take them!" replied the Spartan.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  On the fifth day the patience of Xerxes was exhausted, and he
sent a detachment of Medes and Cissians <a href="#note-64" name="noteref-64"><small>64</small></a> into the pass, with
orders to bring its rash and obstinate defenders alive into his
presence.  The Medes and Cissians were repulsed with considerable
loss.  "The Immortal Band" were now ordered to advance, under the
command of Hydarnes.  But even the skill and courage of that warlike
troop were equally unsuccessful; their numbers were crippled by the
narrowness of the pass, and their short weapons coped to great
disadvantage with the long spears of the Greeks.  The engagement was
renewed a second day with the like fortune; the loss of the Persians
was great, although the scanty numbers of the Spartans were also
somewhat diminished.
</p>
<p>
In the midst of the perplexity which pervaded the king's councils
after this defeat, there arrived at the Persian camp one Ephialtes, a
Malian.  Influenced by the hope of a great reward, this traitor
demanded and obtained an audience, in which he offered to conduct the
Medes through a secret path across the mountains, into the pass.  The
offer was joyfully accepted, and Hydarnes, with the forces under his
command, was despatched under the guidance of the Malian.  At the dusk
of evening the detachment left the camp, and marching all night, from
the river Asopus, between the mountains of Oeta on the right hand, and
the Trachinian ridges on the left, they found themselves at the early
dawn at the summit of the hill, on which a thousand Phocians had been
stationed to defend the pass, for it was not unknown to the Spartans.
In the silence of dawn they wound through the thick groves of oak that
clad the ascent, and concealed the glitter of their arms; but the
exceeding stillness of the air occasioned the noise they made in
trampling on the leaves <a href="#note-65" name="noteref-65"><small>65</small></a> to reach the ears of the Phocians.  That
band sprang up from the earth on which they had slept, to the
consternation and surprise of the invaders, and precipitately betook
themselves to arms.  The Persians, though unprepared for an enemy at
this spot, drew up in battle array, and the heavy onslaught of their
arrows drove the Phocians to seek a better shelter up the mountains,
not imagining that the passage into the defile, but their own
destruction, was the object of the enterprise.  The Persians prudently
forbore pursuit, but availing themselves of the path now open to their
progress, rapidly descended the opposite side of the mountain.
</p>
<p>
IX.  Meanwhile, dark and superstitious terrors were at work in the
Grecian camp.  The preceding eve the soothsayer (Megistias) had
inspected the entrails, and foretold that death awaited the defenders
of Thermopylae in the morning; and on that fatal night a Cumaean
deserted from the Persian camp had joined Leonidas, and informed him
of the treachery of Ephialtes.  At early day their fears were
confirmed by the sentinels posted on the mountains, who fled into the
defile at the approach of the barbarians.
</p>
<p>
A hasty council was assembled; some were for remaining, some for
flight.  The council ended with the resolution of a general retreat,
probably with the assent, possibly by the instances, of Leonidas, who
was contented to possess the monopoly of glory and of death.  The laws
of the Spartans forbade them to fly from any enemy, however numerous,
and Leonidas did not venture to disobey them.  Perhaps his resolution
was strengthened by an oracle of that Delphi so peculiarly venerated
by the Dorian race, and which foretold either the fall of Sparta, or
the sacrifice of a Spartan king of the blood of Hercules.  To men
whose whole happiness was renown, life had no temptation equal to such
a death!
</p>
<p>
X.  Leonidas and his countrymen determined to keep the field.  The
Thespians alone voluntarily remained to partake his fate; but he
detained also the suspected Thebans, rather as a hostage than an
auxiliary.  The rest of the confederates precipitately departed across
the mountains to their native cities.  Leonidas would have dismissed
the prophetic soothsayer, but Megistias insisted on his right to
remain; he contented himself with sending away his only son, who had
accompanied the expedition.  Even the stern spirit of Leonidas is said
to have yielded to the voice of nature; and he ordered two of his
relations to return to Sparta to report the state of affairs.  "You
prescribe to us the duties of messengers, not of soldiers," was the
reply, as the warriors buckled on their shields, and took their posts
with the rest.
</p>
<p>
If history could penetrate from events into the hearts of the agents,
it would be interesting even to conjecture the feelings of this
devoted band, awaiting the approach of a certain death, in that
solitary defile.  Their enthusiasm, and that rigid and Spartan spirit
which had made all ties subservient to obedience to the law&mdash;all
excitement tame to that of battle&mdash;all pleasure dull to the
anticipation of glory&mdash;probably rendered the hours preceding death the
most enviable of their lives.  They might have exulted in the same
elevating fanaticism which distinguished afterward the followers of
Mahomet; and seen that opening paradise in immortality below, which
the Moslemin beheld in anticipation above.
</p>
<p>
XI.  Early on that awful morning, Xerxes offered a solemn libation to
his gods, and at the middle of the noon, when Hydarnes might be
supposed to be close upon the rear of the enemy, the barbarian troops
commenced their march.  Leonidas and his band advanced beyond their
intrenchment, into the broader part of the defile.  Before the fury of
their despair, the Persians fell in great numbers; many of them were
hurled into the sea, others trodden down and crushed by the press of
their own numbers.
</p>
<p>
When the spears of the Greeks were shivered in pieces they had
recourse to their swords, and the battle was fought hand to hand: thus
fighting, fell Leonidas, surrounded in death by many of his band, of
various distinction and renown.  Two half-brothers of Xerxes, mingling
in the foremost of the fray, contended for the body of the Spartan
king, and perished by the Grecian sword.
</p>
<p>
For a short time the Spartans repelled the Persian crowd, who, where
valour failed to urge them on, were scourged to the charge by the lash
of their leaders, and drew the body of Leonidas from the press; and
now, winding down the pass, Hydarnes and his detachment descended to
the battle.  The scene then became changed, the Spartans retired,
still undaunted, or rather made yet more desperate as death drew near,
into the narrowest of the pass, and, ranged upon an eminence of the
strait, they died&mdash;fighting, even after their weapons were broken,
with their hands and teeth&mdash;rather crushed beneath the number than
slain by the swords of the foe&mdash;"non victi sed vincendo fatigati."
<a href="#note-67" name="noteref-67"><small>67</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XII.  Two Spartans of the three hundred, Eurytus and Aristodemus, had,
in consequence of a severe disorder in the eyes, been permitted to
sojourn at Alpeni; but Eurytus, hearing of the contest, was led by his
helot into the field, and died with his countrymen.  Aristodemus alone
remained, branded with disgrace on his return to Sparta; but
subsequently redeeming his name at the battle of Plataea. <a href="#note-68" name="noteref-68"><small>68</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The Thebans, beholding the victory of the Persians, yielded their
arms; and, excepting a few, slain as they approached, not as foes, but
as suppliants, were pardoned by Xerxes.
</p>
<p>
The king himself came to view the dead, and especially the corpse of
Leonidas.  He ordered the head of that hero to be cut off, and his
body suspended on a cross <a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69"><small>69</small></a>, an instance of sudden passion, rather
than customary barbarity.  For of all nations the Persians most
honoured valour, even in their foes.
</p>
<p>
XIII.  The moral sense of mankind, which places the example of
self-sacrifice among the noblest lessons by which our nature can be
corrected, has justly immortalized the memory of Leonidas.  It is
impossible to question the virtue of the man, but we may fairly
dispute the wisdom of the system he adorned.  We may doubt whether, in
fact, his death served his country so much as his life would have
done.  It was the distinction of Thermopylae, that its heroes died in
obedience to the laws; it was the distinction of Marathon, that its
heroes lived to defeat the invader and preserve their country.  And in
proof of this distinction, we find afterward, at Plataea, that of all
the allied Greeks the Spartans the most feared the conquerors of
Thermopylae; the Athenians the least feared the fugitives of Marathon.
</p>
<p>
XIV.  Subsequently, on the hill to which the Spartans and Thespians
had finally retired, a lion of stone was erected by the Amphictyons,
in honour of Leonidas; and many years afterward the bones of that hero
were removed to Sparta, and yearly games, at which Spartans only were
allowed to contend, were celebrated round his tomb.  Separate
monuments to the Greeks generally, and to the three hundred who had
refused to retreat, were built also, by the Amphictyons, at
Thermopylae.  Long extant, posterity admired the inscriptions which
they bore; that of the Spartans became proverbial for its sublime
conciseness.
</p>
<p>
"Go, stranger," it said, "and tell the Spartans that we obeyed the
law&mdash;and lie here!"
</p>
<p>
The private friendship of Simonides the poet erected also a monument
to Megistias, the soothsayer, in which it was said truly to his
honour,
</p>
<pre>
    "That the fate he foresaw he remained to brave;"
</pre>
<p>
Such is the history of the battle of Thermopylae (B. C. 480). <a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70"><small>70</small></a>

</p>
<p>
I.  After the victory of Thermopylae, Demaratus advised the Persian
monarch to despatch a detachment of three hundred vessels to the
Laconian coast, and seize the Island of Cythera, of which a Spartan
once (foreseeing how easily hereafter that post might be made to
command and overawe the Laconian capital) had said, "It were better
for Sparta if it were sunk into the sea."  The profound experience of
Demaratus in the selfish and exclusive policy of his countrymen made
him argue that, if this were done, the fears of Sparta for herself
would prevent her joining the forces of the rest of Greece, and leave
the latter a more easy prey to the invader.
</p>
<p>
The advice, fortunately for the Greeks, was overruled by Achaemenes.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the Grecian navy, assembled off Artemisium, was agitated by
divers councils.  Beholding the vast number of barbarian ships now
collected at Aphetae, and the whole shores around swarming with
hostile troops, the Greeks debated the necessity of retreat.
</p>
<p>
The fleet was under the command of Eurybiades, the Spartan.  For
although Athens furnished a force equal to all the rest of the allies
together, and might justly, therefore, have pretended to the command,
yet the jealousy of the confederates, long accustomed to yield to the
claims of Sparta, and unwilling to acknowledge a new superiority in
another state, had induced the Athenians readily to forego their
claim.  And this especially at the instance of Themistocles.  "To
him," says Plutarch, "Greece not only owes her preservation, but the
Athenians in particular the glory of surpassing their enemies in
valour and their allies in moderation."  But if fortune gave
Eurybiades the nominal command, genius forced Themistocles into the
actual pre-eminence.  That extraordinary man was, above all, adapted
to his time; and, suited to its necessities, he commanded its fates.
His very fault in the callousness of the moral sentiment, and his
unscrupulous regard to expediency, peculiarly aided him in his
management of men.  He could appeal to the noblest passions&mdash;he could
wind himself into the most base.  Where he could not exalt he
corrupted, where he could not persuade he intimidated, where he could
not intimidate he bribed. <a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71"><small>71</small></a>
</p>
<p>
When the intention to retreat became generally circulated, the
inhabitants of the northern coast of Euboea (off which the Athenian
navy rode) entreated Eurybiades at least to give them time to remove
their slaves and children from the vengeance of the barbarian.
Unsuccessful with him, they next sought Themistocles.  For the
consideration of thirty talents, the Athenian promised to remain at
Artemisium, and risk the event of battle.  Possessed of this sum, he
won over the sturdy Spartan by the gift of five talents, and to
Adimantus the Corinthian, the most obstinate in retreat, he privately
sent three <a href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"><small>72</small></a>.  The remainder he kept for his own uses;&mdash;
distinguished from his compeers in this&mdash;that he obtained a much
larger share of the gift than they; that they were bribed to be brave,
and that he was rewarded for bribing them.  The pure-minded statesman
of the closet cannot but feel some disdain and some regret to find,
blended together, the noblest actions and the paltriest motives.  But
whether in ancient times or in modern, the web of human affairs is
woven from a mingled yarn, and the individuals who save nations are
not always those most acceptable to the moralist.  The share of
Themistocles in this business is not, however, so much to his
discredit as to that of the Spartan Eurybiades.  We cannot but observe
that no system contrary to human nature is strong against actual
temptation.  The Spartan law interdicted the desire of riches, and the
Spartans themselves yielded far more easily to the lust of avarice
than the luxurious Athenians.  Thus a native of Zelea, a city in Asia
Minor, had sought to corrupt the Peloponnesian cities by Persian gold:
it was not the Spartans, it was the Athenians, who declared this man
infamous, and placed his life out of the pale of the Grecian law.
With a noble pride Demosthenes speaks of this decree.  "The gold," he,
says, "was brought into Peloponnesus, not to Athens.  But our
ancestors extended their care beyond their own city to the whole of
Greece." <a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73"><small>73</small></a>  An Aristides is formed by the respect paid to
integrity, which society tries in vain&mdash;a Demaratus, an Eurybiades,
and, as we shall see, a Pausanias, by the laws which, affecting to
exclude the influence of the passions, render their temptations novel,
and their effects irresistible.
</p>
<p>
II.  The Greeks continued at Euboea; and the Persians, eager to engage
so inconsiderable an enemy, despatched two hundred chosen vessels,
with orders to make a circuitous route beyond Sciathos, and thus,
unperceived, to attack the Grecian rear, while on a concerted signal
the rest would advance upon the front.
</p>
<p>
A deserter of Scios escaped, however, from Aphetae, and informed the
Greeks of the Persian plan.  Upon this it was resolved at midnight to
advance against that part of the fleet which had been sent around
Euboea.  But as twilight approached, they appeared to have changed or
delayed this design, and proceeded at once towards the main body of
the fleet, less perhaps with the intention of giving regular battle,
than of attempting such detached skirmishes as would make experiment
of their hardihood and skill.  The Persians, amazed at the infatuation
of their opponents, drew out their fleet in order, and succeeded in
surrounding the Greek ships.
</p>
<p>
The night, however, separated the hostile forces, but not until the
Greeks had captured thirty of the barbarian vessels; the first ship
was taken by an Athenian.  The victory, however, despite this
advantage, was undecided, when the Greeks returned to Artemisium, the
Persians to Aphetae.
</p>
<p>
III.  But during the night one of those sudden and vehement storms not
unfrequent to the summers of Greece broke over the seas.  The Persians
at Aphetae heard, with a panic dismay, the continued thunder that
burst above the summit of Mount Pelion; and the bodies of the dead and
the wrecks of ships, floating round the prows, entangled their oars
amid a tempestuous and heavy sea.  But the destruction which the
Persians at Aphetae anticipated to themselves, actually came upon that
part of the barbarian fleet which had made the circuit round Euboea.
Remote from land, exposed to all the fury of the tempest, ignorant of
their course, and amid the darkness of night, they were dashed to
pieces against those fearful rocks termed "The Hollows," and not a
single galley escaped the general destruction.
</p>
<p>
Thus the fleet of the barbarians was rendered more equal to that of
the Greeks.  Re-enforced by fifty-three ships from Athens the next
day, the Greeks proceeded at evening against that part of the hostile
navy possessed by the Cilicians.  These they utterly defeated, and
returned joyfully to Artemisium.
</p>
<p>
Hitherto these skirmishes, made on the summer evenings, in order
probably to take advantage of the darkening night to break off before
any irremediable loss was sustained, seem rather to have been for the
sake of practice in the war&mdash;chivalric sorties as it were&mdash;than actual
and deliberate engagements.  But the third day, the Persians,
impatient of conquest, advanced to Artemisium.  These sea encounters
were made precisely on the same days as the conflicts at Thermopylae;
the object on each was the same&mdash;the gaining in one of the sea defile,
in the other of the land entrance into Greece.  The Euripus was the
Thermopylae of the ocean.
</p>
<p>
IV.  The Greeks remained in their station, and there met the shock;
the battle was severe and equal; the Persians fought with great valour
and firmness, and although the loss upon their side was far the
greatest, many of the Greek vessels also perished.  They separated as
by mutual consent, neither force the victor.  Of the Persian fleet the
Egyptians were the most distinguished&mdash;of the Grecian the Athenians;
and of the last none equalled in valour Clinias; his ship was manned
at his own expense.  He was the father of that Alcibiades, afterward
so famous.
</p>
<p>
While the Greeks rested at Artemisium, counting the number of their
slain, and amid the wrecks of their vessels, they learned the fate of
Leonidas. <a href="#note-74" name="noteref-74"><small>74</small></a>  This determined their previous consultations on the
policy of retreat, and they abandoned the Euripus in steady and
marshalled order, the Corinthians first, the Athenians closing the
rear.  Thus the Persians were left masters of the sea and land
entrance into Greece.
</p>
<p>
But even in retreat, the active spirit of Themistocles was intent upon
expedients.  It was more than suspected that a considerable portion of
the Ionians now in the service of Xerxes were secretly friendly to the
Greeks.  In the swiftest of the Athenian vessels Themistocles
therefore repaired to a watering-place on the coast, and engraved upon
the rocks these words, which were read by the Ionians the next day.
</p>
<p>
"Men of Ionia, in fighting against your ancestors, and assisting to
enslave Greece, you act unworthily.  Come over to us; or if that may
not be, at least retire from the contest, and prevail on the Carians
to do the same.  If yet neither secession nor revolt be practicable,
at least when we come to action exert not yourselves against us.
Remember that we are descended from one common race, and that it was
on your behalf that we first incurred the enmity of the Persian."
</p>
<p>
A subtler intention than that which was the more obvious, was couched
beneath this exhortation.  For if it failed to seduce the Ionians, it
might yet induce Xerxes to mistrust their alliance.
</p>
<p>
When the Persians learned that the Greeks had abandoned their station,
their whole fleet took possession of the pass, possessed themselves of
the neighbouring town of Histiaea, and overrunning a part of the Isle
of Euboea, received the submission of the inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
Xerxes now had recourse to a somewhat clumsy, though a very commonly
practised artifice.  Twenty thousand of his men had fallen at
Thermopylae: of these he buried nineteen thousand, and leaving the
remainder uninterred, he invited all who desired it, by public
proclamation, to examine the scene of contest.  As a considerable
number of helots had joined their Spartan lords and perished with
them, the bodies of the slain amounted to four thousand <a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75"><small>75</small></a>, while
those of the Persians were only one thousand.  This was a practical
despotic bulletin.
</p>
<p>
V.  Of all the neighbouring district, the Phocians had alone remained
faithful to the Grecian cause: their territory was now overrun by the
Persians, at the instance of their hereditary enemies, the
Thessalians, destroying city and temple, and committing all the
horrors of violence and rapine by the way.  Arrived at Panopeae, the
bulk of the barbarian army marched through Boeotia towards Athens,
the great object of revenge, while a separate detachment was sent
to Delphi, with a view of plundering the prodigious riches
accumulated in that celebrated temple, and of which, not perhaps
uncharacteristically, Xerxes was said to be better informed than of
the treasures he had left behind in his own palace.
</p>
<p>
But the wise and crafty priesthood of Delphi had been too long
accustomed successfully to deceive mankind to lose hope or
self-possession at the approach even of so formidable a foe.  When the
dismayed citizens of Delphi ran to the oracle, demanding advice and
wishing to know what should be done with the sacred treasures, the
priestess gravely replied that "the god could take care of his own
possessions, and that the only business of the citizens was to provide
for themselves;" a priestly answer, importing that the god considered
his possessions, and not the flock, were the treasure.  The one was
sure to be defended by a divinity, the other might shift for
themselves.
</p>
<p>
The citizens were not slow in adopting the advice; they immediately
removed their wives and children into Achaia&mdash;while the males and
adults fled&mdash;some to Amphissa, some amid the craggy recesses of
Parnassus, or into that vast and spacious cavern at the base of Mount
Corycus, dedicated to the Muses, and imparting to those lovely deities
the poetical epithet of Corycides.  Sixty men, with the chief priest,
were alone left to protect the sacred city.
</p>
<p>
VI.  But superstition can dispense with numbers in its agency.  Just
as the barbarians were in sight of the temple, the sacred arms,
hitherto preserved inviolable in the sanctuary, were seen by the
soothsayer to advance to the front of the temple.  And this prodigy
but heralded others more active.  As the enemy now advanced in the
stillness of the deserted city, and impressed doubtless by their own
awe (for not to a Persian army could there have seemed no veneration
due to the Temple of the Sun!) just by the shrine of Minerva Pronaea,
built out in front of the great temple, a loud peal of thunder burst
suddenly over their heads, and two enormous fragments of rock
(separated from the heights of that Parnassus amid whose recesses
mortals as well as gods lay hid) rolled down the mountain-side with a
mighty crash, and destroyed many of the Persian multitude.  At the
same time, from the temple of the warlike goddess broke forth a loud
and martial shout, as if to arms.  Confused&mdash;appalled&mdash;panic-stricken
by these supernatural prodigies&mdash;the barbarians turned to fly; while
the Delphians, already prepared and armed, rushed from cave and
mountain, and, charging in the midst of the invaders, scattered them
with great slaughter.  Those who escaped fled to the army in Boeotia.
Thus the treasures of Delphi were miraculously preserved, not only
from the plunder of the Persian, but also from the clutch of the
Delphian citizens themselves, who had been especially anxious, in the
first instance, to be permitted to deposite the treasures in a place
of safety.  Nobody knew better than the priests that treasures always
diminish when transferred from one hand to another.
</p>
<p>
VII.  The Grecian fleet anchored at Salamis by the request of the
Athenians, who were the more anxious immediately to deliberate on the
state of affairs, as the Persian army was now approaching their
borders, and they learned that the selfish warriors of the
Peloponnesus, according to their customary policy, instead of
assisting the Athenians and Greece generally, by marching towards
Boeotia, were engaged only in fortifying the isthmus or providing for
their own safety.
</p>
<p>
Unable to engage the confederates to assist them in protecting Attica,
the Athenians entreated, at least, the rest of the maritime allies to
remain at Salamis, while they themselves hastened back to Athens.
</p>
<p>
Returned home, their situation was one which their generous valour had
but little merited.  Although they had sent to Artemisium the
principal defence of the common cause, now, when the storm rolled
towards themselves, none appeared on their behalf.  They were at once
incensed and discouraged by the universal desertion. <a href="#note-76" name="noteref-76"><small>76</small></a>  How was it
possible that, alone and unaided, they could withstand the Persian
multitude?  Could they reasonably expect the fortunes of Marathon to
be perpetually renewed?  To remain at Athens was destruction&mdash;to leave
it seemed to them a species of impiety.  Nor could they anticipate
victory with a sanguine hope, in abandoning the monuments of their
ancestors and the temples of their gods. <a href="#note-77" name="noteref-77"><small>77</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Themistocles alone was enabled to determine the conduct of his
countrymen in this dilemma.  Inexhaustible were the resources of a
genius which ranged from the most lofty daring to the most intricate
craft.  Perceiving that the only chance of safety was in the desertion
of the city, and that the strongest obstacle to this alternative was
in the superstitious attachment to HOME ever so keenly felt by the
ancients, he had recourse, in the failure of reason, to a
counter-superstition.  In the temple of the citadel was a serpent,
dedicated to Minerva, and considered the tutelary defender of the place.
The food appropriated to the serpent was suddenly found unconsumed&mdash;the
serpent itself vanished; and, at the suggestion of Themistocles, the
priests proclaimed that the goddess had deserted the city and offered
herself to conduct them to the seas.  Then, amid the general excitement,
Themistocles reiterated his version of the Delphic oracle. Then were the
ships reinterpreted to be the wooden walls, and Salamis once more
proclaimed "the Divine."  The fervour of the people was awakened&mdash;the
persuasions of Themistocles prevailed&mdash;even the women loudly declared
their willingness to abandon Athens for the sake of the Athenians; and
it was formally decreed that the city should be left to the guardianship
of Minerva, and the citizens should save themselves, their women,
children, and slaves, as their own discretion might suggest.  Most of
them took refuge in Troezene, where they were generously supported at
the public expense&mdash;some at Aegina&mdash;others repaired to Salamis.
</p>
<p>
A moving and pathetic spectacle was that of the embarcation of the
Athenians for the Isle of Salamis.  Separated from their children,
their wives (who were sent to remoter places of safety)&mdash;abandoning
their homes and altars&mdash;the citadel of Minerva&mdash;the monuments of
Marathon&mdash;they set out for a scene of contest (B. C. 480), perilous
and precarious, and no longer on the site of their beloved and
father-land.  Their grief was heightened by the necessity of leaving
many behind, whose extreme age rendered them yet more venerable, while
it incapacitated their removal.  Even the dumb animals excited all the
fond domestic associations, running to the strand, and expressing by
their cries their regret for the hands that fed them: one of them, a
dog, that belonged to Xanthippus, father of Pericles, is said to have
followed the ships, and swam to Salamis, to die, spent with toil, upon
the sands.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  The fleet now assembled at Salamis; the Spartans contributed
only sixteen vessels, the people of Aegina thirty&mdash;swift galleys and
well equipped; the Athenians one hundred and eighty; the whole navy,
according to Herodotus, consisted of three hundred and seventy-eight
<a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78"><small>78</small></a> ships, besides an inconsiderable number of vessels of fifty oars.
</p>
<p>
Eurybiades still retained the chief command.  A council of war was
held.  The greater number of the more influential allies were composed
of Peloponnesians, and, with the countenance of the Spartan chief, it
was proposed to retire from Salamis and fix the station in the isthmus
near the land-forces of Peloponnesus.  This was highly consonant to
the interested policy of the Peloponnesian states, and especially to
that of Sparta; Attica was considered already lost, and the fate of
that territory they were therefore indisposed to consider.  While the
debate was yet pending, a messenger arrived from Athens with the
intelligence that the barbarian, having reduced to ashes the allied
cities of Thespiae and Plataea in Boeotia, had entered Attica; and
shortly afterward they learned that (despite a desperate resistance
from the handful of Athenians who, some from poverty, some from a
superstitious prejudice in favour of the wooden wall of the citadel,
had long held out, though literally girt by fire from the burning of
their barricades) the citadel had been taken, plundered, and burnt,
and the remnant of its defenders put to the sword.
</p>
<p>
IX.  Consternation seized the council; many of the leaders broke away
hastily, went on board, hoisted their sails, and prepared to fly.
Those who remained in the council determined that an engagement at sea
could only be risked near the isthmus.  With this resolve the leaders
at night returned to their ships.
</p>
<p>
It is singular how often, in the most memorable events, the fate and
the glory of nations is decided by the soul of a single man.  When
Themistocles had retired to his vessel, he was sought by Mnesiphilus,
who is said to have exercised an early and deep influence over the
mind of Themistocles, and to have been one of those practical yet
thoughtful statesmen called into existence by the sober philosophy of
Solon <a href="#note-79" name="noteref-79"><small>79</small></a>, whose lessons on the science of government made a
groundwork for the rhetorical corruptions of the later sophists.  On
learning the determination of the council, Mnesiphilus forcibly
represented its consequences.  "If the allies," said he, "once abandon
Salamis, you have lost for ever the occasion of fighting for your
country.  The fleet will certainly separate, the various confederates
return home, and Greece will perish.  Hasten, therefore, ere yet it be
too late, and endeavour to persuade Eurybiades to change his
resolution and remain."
</p>
<p>
This advice, entirely agreeable to the views of Themistocles, excited
that chief to new exertions.  He repaired at once to Eurybiades; and,
by dint of that extraordinary mastery over the minds of others which
he possessed, he finally won over the Spartan, and, late as the hour
was, persuaded him to reassemble the different leaders.
</p>
<p>
X.  In that nocturnal council debate grew loud and warm.  When
Eurybiades had explained his change of opinion and his motives for
calling the chiefs together; Themistocles addressed the leaders at
some length and with great excitement.  It was so evidently the
interest of the Corinthians to make the scene of defence in the
vicinity of Corinth, that we cannot be surprised to find the
Corinthian leader, Adimantus, eager to interrupt the Athenian.
"Themistocles," said he, "they who at the public games rise before
their time are beaten."
</p>
<p>
"True," replied Themistocles, with admirable gentleness and temper;
"but they who are left behind are never crowned."
</p>
<p>
Pursuing the advantage which a skilful use of interruption always
gives to an orator, the Athenian turned to Eurybiades.  Artfully
suppressing his secret motive in the fear of the dispersion of the
allies, which he rightly judged would offend without convincing, he
had recourse to more popular arguments.  "Fight at the isthmus," he
said, "and you fight in the open sea, where, on account of our heavier
vessels and inferior number, you contend with every disadvantage.
Grant even success, you will yet lose, by your retreat, Salamis,
Megara, and Aegina.  You would preserve the Peloponnesus, but
remember, that by attracting thither the war, you attract not only the
naval, but also the land forces of the enemy.  Fight here, and we have
the inestimable advantage of a narrow sea&mdash;we shall preserve Salamis,
the refuge of our wives and children&mdash;we shall as effectually protect
the Peloponnesus as by repairing to the isthmus and drawing the
barbarian thither.  If we obtain the victory, the enemy will neither
advance to the isthmus nor penetrate beyond Attica.  Their retreat is
sure."
</p>
<p>
The orator was again interrupted by Adimantus with equal rudeness.
And Themistocles, who well knew how to alternate force with
moderation, and menace with persuasion, retorted with an equal
asperity, but with a singular dignity and happiness of expression.
</p>
<p>
"It becomes you," said Adimantus, scornfully, alluding to the capture
of Athens, "it becomes you to be silent, and not to advise us to
desert our country; you, who no longer have a country to defend!
Eurybiades can only be influenced by Themistocles when Themistocles
has once more a city to represent."
</p>
<p>
"Wretch!" replied Themistocles, sternly, "we have indeed left our
walls and houses&mdash;preferring freedom to those inanimate possessions&mdash;
but know that the Athenians still possess a country and a city,
greater and more formidable than yours, well provided with stores and
men, which none of the Greeks will be able to resist: our ships are
our country and our city."
</p>
<p>
"If," he added, once more addressing the Spartan chief, "if you
continue here you will demand our eternal gratitude: fly, and you are
the destroyers of Greece.  In this war the last and sole resource of
the Athenians is their fleet: reject my remonstrances, and I warn you
that at once we will take our families on board, and sail to that
Siris, on the Italian shores, which of old is said to have belonged to
us, and in which, if the oracle be trusted, we ought to found a city.
Deprived of us, you will remember my words."
</p>
<p>
XI.  The menace of Themistocles&mdash;the fear of so powerful a race,
unhoused, exasperated, and in search of a new settlement&mdash;and the yet
more immediate dread of the desertion of the flower of the navy&mdash;
finally prevailed.  Eurybiades announced his concurrence with the
views of Themistocles, and the confederates, wearied with altercation,
consented to risk the issue of events at Salamis.
</p>
<p>
XII.  Possessed of Athens, the Persian king held also his council of
war.  His fleet, sailing up the Euripus, anchored in the Attic bay of
Phalerum; his army encamped along the plains around, or within the
walls of Athens.  The losses his armament had sustained were already
repaired by new re-enforcements of Malians, Dorians, Locrians,
Bactrians, Carystians, Andrians, Tenedians, and the people of the
various isles.  "The farther," says Herodotus, "the Persians
penetrated into Greece, the greater the numbers by which they were
followed."  It may be supposed, however, that the motley contributions
of an idle and predatory multitude, or of Greeks compelled, not by
affection, but fear, ill supplied to Xerxes the devoted thousands,
many of them his own gallant Persians, who fell at Thermopylae or
perished in the Euboean seas.
</p>
<p>
XIII.  Mardonius and the leaders generally were for immediate battle.
The heroine Artemisia alone gave a more prudent counsel.  She
represented to them, that if they delayed a naval engagement or sailed
to the Peloponnesus <a href="#note-80" name="noteref-80"><small>80</small></a>, the Greeks, failing of provisions and
overruled by their fears, would be certain to disperse, to retire to
their several homes, and, thus detached, fall an easy prey to his
arms.
</p>
<p>
Although Xerxes, contrary to expectation, received the adverse opinion
of the Carian princess with compliments and praise, he yet adopted the
counsel of the majority; and, attributing the ill success at
Artemisium to his absence, resolved in person to witness the triumph
of his arms at Salamis.
</p>
<p>
The navy proceeded, in order, to that island: the land-forces on the
same night advanced to the Peloponnesus: there, under Cleombrotus,
brother to Leonidas, all the strength of the Peloponnesian
confederates was already assembled.  They had fortified the pass of
Sciron, another Thermopylae in its local character, and protected the
isthmus by a wall, at the erection of which the whole army worked
night and day; no materials sufficing for the object of defence were
disdained&mdash;wood, stones, bricks, and sand&mdash;all were pressed into
service.  Here encamped, they hoped nothing from Salamis&mdash;they
believed the last hope of Greece rested solely with themselves. <a href="#note-81" name="noteref-81"><small>81</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XIV.  Again new agitation, fear, and dissension broke out in the
Grecian navy.  All those who were interested in the safety of the
Peloponnesus complained anew of the resolution of Eurybiades&mdash;urged
the absurdity of remaining at Salamis to contend for a territory
already conquered&mdash;and the leaders of Aegina, Megara, and Athens were
left in a minority in the council.
</p>
<p>
Thus overpowered by the Peloponnesian allies, Themistocles is said to
have bethought himself of a stratagem, not inconsonant with his
scheming and wily character.  Retiring privately from the debate, yet
unconcluded, and summoning the most confidential messenger in his
service <a href="#note-82" name="noteref-82"><small>82</small></a>, he despatched him secretly to the enemy's fleet with
this message&mdash;"The Athenian leader, really attached to the king, and
willing to see the Greeks subjugated to his power, sends me privately
to you.  Consternation has seized the Grecian navy; they are preparing
to fly; lose not the opportunity of a splendid victory.  Divided among
themselves, the Greeks are unable to resist you; and you will see, as
you advance upon them, those who favour and those who would oppose you
in hostility with each other."
</p>
<p>
The Persian admiral was sufficiently experienced in the treachery and
defection of many of the Greeks to confide in the message thus
delivered to him; but he scarcely required such intelligence to
confirm a resolution already formed.  At midnight the barbarians
passed over a large detachment to the small isle of Psyttaleia,
between Salamis and the continent, and occupying the whole narrow sea
as far as the Attic port of Munychia, under cover of the darkness
disposed their ships, so as to surround the Greeks and cut off the
possibility of retreat.
</p>
<p>
XV.  Unconscious of the motions of the enemy, disputes still prevailed
among the chiefs at Salamis, when Themistocles was summoned at night
from the council, to which he had returned after despatching his
messenger to the barbarian.  The person who thus summoned him was
Aristides.  It was the third year of his exile&mdash;which sentence was
evidently yet unrepealed&mdash;or not in that manner, at night and as a
thief, would the eminent and high-born Aristides have joined his
countrymen.  He came from Aegina in an open boat, under cover of the
night passed through the midst of the Persian ships, and arrived at
Salamis to inform the Greeks that they were already surrounded.
</p>
<p>
"At any time," said Aristides, "it would become us to forget our
private dissensions, and at this time especially; contending only who
should most serve his country.  In vain now would the Peloponnesians
advise retreat; we are encompassed, and retreat is impossible."
</p>
<p>
Themistocles welcomed the new-comer with joy, and persuaded him to
enter the council and acquaint the leaders with what he knew.  His
intelligence, received with doubt, was presently confirmed by a
trireme of Tenians, which deserted to them; and they now seriously
contemplated the inevitable resort of battle.
</p>
<p>
XVI.  At dawn all was prepared.  Assembled on the strand, Themistocles
harangued the troops; and when he had concluded, orders were given to
embark.
</p>
<p>
It was in the autumn of 480 B. C., two thousand three hundred and
sixteen years ago, that the battle of Salamis was fought.
</p>
<p>
High on a throne of precious metals, placed on one of the eminences of
Mount Aegaleos, sat, to survey the contest, the royal Xerxes.  The
rising sun beheld the shores of the Eleusinian gulf lined with his
troops to intercept the fugitives, and with a miscellaneous and motley
crowd of such as were rather spectators than sharers of the conflict.
<a href="#note-83" name="noteref-83"><small>83</small></a>
</p>
<p>
But not as the Persian leaders had expected was the aspect of the foe;
nor did the Greeks betray the confusion or the terror ascribed to them
by the emissary of Themistocles.  As the daylight made them manifest
to the Persian, they set up the loud and martial chorus of the paean&mdash;
"the rocks of Salamis echoed back the shout"&mdash;and, to use the
expression of a soldier of that day <a href="#note-84" name="noteref-84"><small>84</small></a>, "the trumpet inflamed them
with its clangour."
</p>
<p>
As soon as the Greeks began to move, the barbarian vessels advanced
swiftly.  But Themistocles detained the ardour of the Greeks until the
time when a sharp wind usually arose in that sea, occasioning a heavy
swell in the channel, which was peculiarly prejudicial to the unwieldy
ships of the Persians; but not so to the light, low, and compact
vessels of the Greeks.  The manner of attack with the ancient navies
was to bring the prow of the vessel, which was fortified by long
projecting beaks of brass, to bear upon the sides of its antagonist,
and this, the swell of the sea causing the Persian galleys to veer
about unwieldily, the agile ships of the Greeks were well enabled to
effect.
</p>
<p>
By the time the expected wind arose, the engagement was begun.  The
Persian admiral <a href="#note-85" name="noteref-85"><small>85</small></a> directed his manoeuvres chiefly against
Themistocles, for on him, as the most experienced and renowned of the
Grecian leaders, the eyes of the enemy were turned.  From his ship,
which was unusually lofty, as from a castle <a href="#note-86" name="noteref-86"><small>86</small></a>, he sent forth darts
and arrows, until one of the Athenian triremes, commanded by Aminias,
shot from the rest, and bore down upon him with the prow.  The ships
met, and, fastened together by their brazen beaks, which served as
grappling-irons, Ariabignes gallantly boarded the Grecian vessel, and
was instantly slain by the hostile pikes and hurled into the sea <a href="#note-87" name="noteref-87"><small>87</small></a>.
The first who took a ship was an Athenian named Lycomedes.  The
Grecians keeping to the straits, the Persians were unable to bring
their whole armament to bear at once, and could only enter the narrow
pass by detachments; the heaviness of the sea and the cumbrous size of
their tall vessels frequently occasioned more embarrassment to
themselves than the foe&mdash;driven and hustling the one against the
other.  The Athenians maintaining the right wing were opposed by the
Phoenicians; the Spartans on the left by the Ionians.  The first were
gallantly supported by the Aeginetans, who, long skilled in maritime
warfare, eclipsed even their new rivals the Athenians.  The Phoenician
line was broken.  The Greeks pursued their victory, still preserving
the steadiest discipline and the most perfect order.  The sea became
strewn and covered with the wrecks of vessels and the bodies of the
dead; while, to the left, the Ionians gave way before that part of the
allied force commanded by the Spartans, some fighting with great
valour, some favouring the Greek confederates.  Meanwhile, as the
Persians gave way, and the sea became more clear, Aristides, who had
hitherto remained on shore, landed a body of Athenians on the Isle of
Psyttaleia, and put the Persian guard there stationed to the sword.
</p>
<p>
Xerxes from the mountain, his countless thousands from the shore,
beheld, afar and impotent, the confusion, the slaughter, the defeat of
the forces on the sea.  Anxious now only for retreat, the barbarians
retreated to Phalerum; and there, intercepted by the Aeginetans, were
pressed by them in the rear; by the Athenians, led by Themistocles, in
front.  At this time the heroine Artemisia, pursued by that Aminias
whose vessel had first grappled with the Persians, and who of all the
Athenian captains was that day the most eminently distinguished, found
herself in the extremest danger.  Against that remarkable woman the
efforts of the Athenians had been especially directed: deeming it a
disgrace to them to have an enemy in a woman, they had solemnly set a
reward of great amount upon her capture.  Thus pursued, Artemisia had
recourse to a sudden and extraordinary artifice.  Falling in with a
vessel of the Persians, commanded by a Calyndian prince, with whom she
had once been embroiled, she bore down against the ship and sunk it&mdash;a
truly feminine stratagem&mdash;deceiving at once a public enemy and
gratifying a private hatred.  The Athenian, seeing the vessel he had
pursued thus attack a barbarian, conceived he had mistaken a friendly
vessel, probably a deserter from the Persians, for a foe, and
immediately sought new objects of assault.  Xerxes beheld and admired
the prowess of Artemisia, deeming, in the confusion, that it was a
hostile vessel she had sunken. <a href="#note-88" name="noteref-88"><small>88</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XVII.  The battle lasted till the dusk of evening, when at length the
remnant of the barbarian fleet gained the port of Phalerum; and the
Greeks beheld along the Straits of Salamis no other vestige of the
enemy than the wrecks and corpses which were the evidence of his
defeat.
</p>
<p>
XVIII.  When morning came, the Greeks awaited a renewal of the
engagement; for the Persian fleet were still numerous, the Persian
army yet covered the neighbouring shores, and, by a feint to conceal
his real purpose, Xerxes had ordered the Phoenician transports to be
joined together, as if to connect Salamis to the continent.  But a
mandate was already issued for the instant departure of the navy for
the Hellespont, and a few days afterward the army itself retired into
Boeotia.
</p>
<p>
The victory of Salamis was celebrated by solemn rejoicings, in which,
principally remarkable for the beauty of his person, and his
accomplishments on the lyre and in the dance, was a youth named
Sophocles, destined afterward to share the glory of Aeschylus, who, no
less a warrior than a poet, distinguished himself in the battle, and
has bequeathed to us the most detailed and animated account we possess
of its events.
</p>
<p>
The Grecian conquerors beheld the retreat of the enemy with
indignation; they were unwilling that any of that armament which had
burnt their hearths and altars should escape their revenge; they
pursued the Persian ships as far as Andros, where, not reaching them,
they cast anchor and held a consultation.  Themistocles is said to
have proposed, but not sincerely, to sail at once to the Hellespont
and destroy the bridge of boats.  This counsel was overruled, and it
was decided not to reduce so terrible an enemy to despair:&mdash;"Rather,"
said one of the chiefs (whether Aristides or Eurybiades is differently
related), "build another bridge, that Xerxes may escape the sooner out
of Europe."
</p>
<p>
Themistocles affected to be converted to a policy which he desired
only an excuse to effect; and, in pursuance of the hint already
furnished him, is said to have sent secretly to Xerxes, informing him
that it was the intention of the allies to sail to the Hellespont and
destroy the bridge, so that, if the king consulted his safety, he
would return immediately into Asia, while Themistocles would find
pretexts to delay the pursuit of the confederates.
</p>
<p>
This artifice appears natural to the scheming character of
Themistocles; and, from concurrent testimony <a href="#note-89" name="noteref-89"><small>89</small></a>, it seems to me
undoubted that Themistocles maintained a secret correspondence with
Xerxes, and even persuaded that monarch that he was disposed to favour
him.  But it is impossible to believe, with Herodotus, that he had at
that time any real desire to conciliate the Persian, foreseeing that
he might hereafter need a refuge at the Eastern court.  Then in the
zenith of his popularity, so acute a foresight is not in man.  He was
one of those to whom the spirit of intrigue is delight in itself, and
in the present instance it was exerted for the common cause of the
Athenians, which, with all his faults, he never neglected for, but
rather incorporated with, his own.
</p>
<p>
XIX.  Diverted from the notion of pursuing the Persians, the Grecian
allies, flushed with conquest, were yet eager for enterprise.  The
isles which had leagued with the Mede were strongly obnoxious to the
confederates, and it was proposed to exact from them a fine; in
defrayal of the expenses of the war.  Siege was laid to Andros, and
those islanders were the first who resisted the demand.  Then was it
that they made that memorable answer, which may serve as a warning in
all times to the strong when pressing on the desperate.
</p>
<p>
"I bring with me," said Themistocles, "two powerful divinities&mdash;
Persuasion and Force."
</p>
<p>
"And we," answered the Andrians, "have two gods equally powerful on
our side&mdash;Poverty and Despair."
</p>
<p>
The Andrian deities eventually triumphed, and the siege was raised
without effect.  But from the Parians and Carystians, and some other
islanders, Themistocles obtained enormous sums of money unknown to his
colleagues, which, however unjustly extorted, it does not
satisfactorily appear that he applied largely to his own personal
profit, but, as is more probable, to the rebuilding of Athens.
Perhaps he thought, nor without reason, that as the Athenians had been
the principal sufferers in the war, and contributed the most largely
to its resources, so whatever fines were levied on the seceders were
due, not to the confederates generally, but the Athenians alone.  The
previous conduct of the allies, with so much difficulty preserved from
deserting Athens, merited no particular generosity, and excused
perhaps the retaliation of a selfish policy.  The payment of the fine
did not, however, preserve Carystus from attack.  After wasting its
lands, the Greeks returned to Salamis and divided the Persian spoils.
The first fruits were dedicated to the gods, and the choicest of the
booty sent to Delphi.  And here we may notice one anecdote of
Themistocles, which proves, that whatever, at times and in great
crises, was the grasping unscrupulousness of his mind, he had at least
no petty and vulgar avarice.  Seeing a number of bracelets and chains
of gold upon the bodies of the dead, he passed them by, and turning to
one of his friends, "Take these for yourself," said he, "for you are
not Themistocles." <a href="#note-90" name="noteref-90"><small>90</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Meanness or avarice was indeed no part of the character of
Themistocles, although he has been accused of those vices, because
guilty, at times, of extortion.  He was profuse, ostentatious, and
magnificent above his contemporaries and beyond his means.  His very
vices were on a large and splendid scale; and if he had something of
the pirate in his nature, he had nothing of the miser.  When he had to
choose between two suiters for his daughter, he preferred the worthy
to the wealthy candidate&mdash;willing that she should rather marry a man
without money than money without a man. <a href="#note-91" name="noteref-91"><small>91</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XX.  The booty divided, the allies repaired to the isthmus, according
to that beautiful ancient custom of apportioning rewards to such as
had been most distinguished.  It was in the temple of Neptune that the
leaders met.  The right of voting was confined to the several chiefs,
who were to declare whom they thought the first in merit and whom the
second.  Each leader wrote his own name a candidate for the first
rank; but a great majority of suffrages awarded the second to
Themistocles.  While, therefore, each leader had only a single
suffrage in favour of the first rank, the second rank was
unequivocally due to the Athenian.
</p>
<p>
XXI.  But even conquest had not sufficed to remove the jealousies of
the confederate leaders&mdash;they evaded the decision of a question which
could not but be propitious to the Athenians, and returned home
without having determined the point which had assembled them at the
isthmus.  But Themistocles was not of a temper to brook patiently this
fraud upon his honours.  Far from sharing the petty and miserable
envies of their chiefs, the Greeks generally were loud in praise of
his wisdom and services; and, taking advantage of their enthusiasm,
Themistocles repaired to Sparta, trusting to the generosity of the
principal rival to compensate the injustice of many.  His expectations
were not ill-founded&mdash;the customs of Sparta allowed no slight to a
Spartan, and they adjudged therefore the prize of valour to their own
Eurybiades, while they awarded that of wisdom or science to
Themistocles.  Each was equally honoured with a crown of olive.
Forgetful of all their prejudices, their envy, and their inhospitable
treatment of strangers, that nation of warriors were dazzled by the
hero whose courage assimilated to their own.  They presented him with
the stateliest chariot to be found in Sparta, and solemnly conducted
him homeward as far as Tegea, by an escort of three hundred chosen
Spartans called "The Knights"&mdash;the sole example of the Spartans
conducting any man from their city.  It is said that on his return to
Athens, Themistocles was reproached by Timodemus of Aphidna, a
Belbinite by origin <a href="#note-92" name="noteref-92"><small>92</small></a>, and an implacable public enemy, with his
visit to Sparta: "The honours awarded you," said Timodemus, "are
bestowed from respect, not to you, but to Athens."
</p>
<p>
"My friend," retorted the witty chief, "the matter stands thus.  Had I
been a Belbinite, I had not been thus distinguished at Sparta, nor
would you, although you had been born an Athenian!"
</p>
<p>
While the Greeks were thus occupied, the Persian army had retreated
with Mardonius into Thessaly.  Here that general selected and
marshalled the forces with which he intended to renew the war,
retaining in his service the celebrated Immortals.  The total,
including the cavalry, Herodotus estimates at three hundred thousand
men.
</p>
<p>
Thus occupied, and ere Xerxes departed from Thessaly, the Spartans,
impelled by an oracle, sent a messenger to Xerxes to demand atonement
for the death of Leonidas.
</p>
<p>
"Ay," replied the king, laughing, "this man (pointing to Mardonius)
shall make you fitting retribution."
</p>
<p>
Leaving Mardonius in Thessaly, where he proposed to winter, Xerxes now
hastened home.  Sixty thousand Persians under Artabazus accompanied
the king only as far as the passage into Asia; and it was with an
inconsiderable force, which, pressed by famine, devastated the very
herbage on their way, and which a pestilence and the dysentery
diminished as it passed, that the great king crossed the Hellespont,
on which the bridge of boats had already been broken by wind and
storm.  A more abundant supply of provisions than they had yet
experienced tempted the army to excesses, to which many fell victims.
The rest arrived at Sardis with Xerxes, whence he afterward returned
to his more distant capital.
</p>
<p>
XXII.  The people of Potidaea, on the Isthmus of Pallene, and
Olynthus, inhabited by the Bottiaeans, a dubious and mongrel race,
that boasted their origin from those Athenians who, in the traditional
ages, had been sent as tributary captives to the Cretan Minos, no
sooner learned the dispersion of the fleet at Salamis, and the retreat
of the king, than they openly revolted from the barbarian.  Artabazus,
returning from the Hellespont, laid siege to Olynthus, massacred the
inhabitants, and colonized the town with Chalcidians.  He then sat
down before Potidaea; but a terrible inundation of the sea, with the
sallies of the besieged, destroyed the greater number of the
unfortunate invaders.  The remnant were conducted by Artabazus into
Thessaly, to join the army of Mardonius.  The Persian fleet,
retreating from Salamis, after passing over the king and his forces
from the Chersonese to Abydos, wintered at Cuma; and at the
commencement of the spring assembled at Samos.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the Athenians returned to their dismantled city, and
directed their attention to its repair and reconstruction.  It was
then, too, that in all probability the people hastened, by a formal
and solemn reversal of the sentence of ostracism, to reward the
services of Aristides, and to restore to the commonwealth the most
spotless of its citizens. <a href="#note-93" name="noteref-93"><small>93</small></a>

</p>
<p>
I.  The dawning spring and the formidable appearance of Mardonius,
who, with his Persian forces, diminished indeed, but still mighty,
lowered on their confines, aroused the Greeks to a sense of their
danger.  Their army was not as yet assembled, but their fleet,
consisting of one hundred and ten vessels, under the command of
Leotychides, king of Sparta, and Xanthippus of Athens, lay off Aegina.
Thus anchored, there came to the naval commanders certain Chians, who,
having been discovered in a plot against the life of Strattis, a
tyrant imposed upon Chios by the Persians, fled to Aegina.  They
declared that all Ionia was ripe for revolt, and their representations
induced the Greeks to advance as far as the sacred Delos.
</p>
<p>
Beyond they dared not venture, ignorant alike of the localities of the
country and the forces of the enemy.  Samos seemed to them no less
remote than the Pillars of Hercules, and mutual fear thus kept the
space between the Persian and the Greek fleet free from the advance of
either.  But Mardonius began slowly to stir from his winter lethargy.
Influenced, thought the Greeks, perhaps too fondly, by a Theban
oracle, the Persian general despatched to Athens no less distinguished
an ambassador than Alexander, the king of Macedon.  That prince,
connected with the Persians by alliance (for his sister had married
the Persian Bubares, son of Megabazus), was considered an envoy
calculated to conciliate the Athenians while he served their enemy.
And it was now the object of Mardonius to reconcile the foe whom he
had failed to conquer.  Aware of the Athenian valour, Mardonius
trusted that if he could detach that state from the confederacy, and
prevail on the Athenians to unite their arms to his own, the rest of
Greece would become an easy conquest.  By land he already deemed
himself secure of fortune, by sea what Grecian navy, if deprived of
the flower of its forces, could resist him?
</p>
<p>
II.  The King of Macedon arrived at Athens; but conscious of the
jealous and anxious fear which the news of an embassy from Persia
would excite among the confederates, the Athenians delayed to grant
him the demanded audience until they had time to send for and obtain
deputies from Sparta to be present at the assembly.
</p>
<p>
Alexander of Macedon then addressed the Athenians.
</p>
<p>
"Men of Athens!" said he, "Mardonius informs you, through me, of this
mandate from the king: 'Whatever injuries,' saith he, 'the Athenians
have done me, I forgive.  Restore them their country&mdash;let them even
annex to it any other territories they covet&mdash;permit them the free
enjoyment of their laws.  If they will ally with me, rebuild the
temples I have burnt.'"
</p>
<p>
Alexander then proceeded to dilate on the consequences of this
favourable mission, to represent the power of the Persian, and urge
the necessity of an alliance.  "Let my offers prevail with you," he
concluded, "for to you alone, of all the Greeks, the king extends his
forgiveness, desiring your alliance."
</p>
<p>
When Alexander had concluded, the Spartan envoys thus spoke through
their chief, addressing, not the Macedonian, but the Athenians:&mdash;"We
have been deputed by the Spartans to entreat you to adopt no measures
prejudicial to Greece, and to receive no conditions from the
barbarians.  This, most iniquitous in itself, would be, above all,
unworthy and ungraceful in you; with you rests the origin of the war
now appertaining to all Greece.  Insufferable, indeed, if the
Athenians, once the authors of liberty to many, were now the authors
of the servitude of Greece.  We commiserate your melancholy condition
&mdash;your privation for two years of the fruits of your soil, your homes
destroyed, and your fortunes ruined.  We, the Spartans, and the other
allies, will receive your women and all who may be helpless in the war
while the war shall last.  Let not the Macedonian, smoothing down the
messages of Mardonius, move you.  This becomes him; tyrant himself, he
would assist in a tyrant's work.  But you will not heed him if you are
wise, knowing that faith and truth are not in the barbarians."
</p>
<p>
III.  The answer of the Athenians to both Spartan and Persian, the
substance of which is, no doubt, faithfully preserved to us by
Herodotus, may rank among the most imperishable records of that
high-souled and generous people.
</p>
<p>
"We are not ignorant," ran the answer, dictated, and, probably,
uttered by Aristides <a href="#note-94" name="noteref-94"><small>94</small></a>, "that the power of the Mede is many times
greater than our own.  We required not that ostentatious admonition.
Yet, for the preservation of liberty, we will resist that power as we
can.  Cease to persuade us to contract alliance with the barbarian.
Bear back to Mardonius this answer from the Athenians&mdash;So long as
yonder sun," and the orator pointed to the orb <a href="#note-95" name="noteref-95"><small>95</small></a>, "holds the
courses which now it holds&mdash;so long will we abjure all amity with
Xerxes&mdash;so long, confiding in the aid of our gods and heroes, whose
shrines and altars he hath burnt, will we struggle against him in
battle and for revenge.  And thou, beware how again thou bearest such
proffers to the Athenians; nor, on the plea of benefit to us, urge us
to dishonour; for we would not&mdash;ungrateful to thee, our guest and our
friend&mdash;have any evil befall to thee from the anger of the Athenians."
</p>
<p>
"For you, Spartans! it may be consonant with human nature that you
should fear our alliance with the barbarians&mdash;yet shamefully you fear
it, knowing with what spirit we are animated and act.  Gold hath no
amount&mdash;earth hath no territory, how beautiful soever&mdash;that can tempt
the Athenians to accept conditions from the Mede for the servitude of
Greece.  Were we so inclined, many and mighty are our prohibitions;
first and chiefly, our temples burnt and overthrown, urging us not to
alliance, but to revenge.  Next, the whole race of Greece has one
consanguinity and one tongue, and common are its manners, its altars,
and its gods base indeed, if Athenians were of these the betrayers.
Lastly, learn now, if ye knew it not before, that, while one Athenian
shall survive, Athens allies herself not with Xerxes."
</p>
<p>
"We thank you for your providence of us&mdash;your offers to protect our
families&mdash;afflicted and impoverished as we are.  We will bear,
however, our misfortunes as we may&mdash;becoming no burden upon you.  Be
it your care to send your forces to the field.  Let there be no delay.
The barbarian will be on us when he learns that we have rejected his
proposals.  Before he proceed to Attica let us meet him in Boeotia."
</p>
<p>
IV.  On receiving this answer from the Athenians the Spartan
ambassadors returned home; and, shortly afterward, Mardonius, by rapid
marches, conducted his army towards Attica; fresh supplies of troops
recruiting his forces wheresoever he passed.  The Thessalian princes,
far from repenting their alliance with Mardonius, animated his ardour.
</p>
<p>
Arrived in Boeotia, the Thebans endeavoured to persuade the Persian
general to encamp in that territory, and to hazard no battle, but
rather to seek by bribes to the most powerful men in each city, to
detach the confederates from the existent alliance.  Pride, ambition,
and the desire of avenging Xerxes once more upon Athens, deterred
Mardonius from yielding to this counsel.  He marched on to Attica&mdash;he
found the territory utterly deserted.  He was informed that the
inhabitants were either at Salamis or with the fleet.  He proceeded to
Athens (B. C. 479), equally deserted, and, ten months after the first
capture by Xerxes, that city a second time was occupied by the Mede.
</p>
<p>
From Athens Mardonius despatched a Greek messenger to Salamis,
repeating the propositions of Alexander.  On hearing these offers in
council, the Athenians were animated by a species of fury.  A
counsellor named Lycidas having expressed himself in favour of the
terms, he was immediately stoned to death.  The Athenian women, roused
by a similar passion with the men, inflicted the same fate upon his
wife and children&mdash;one of those excesses of virtue which become
crimes, but for which exigency makes no despicable excuse. <a href="#note-96" name="noteref-96"><small>96</small></a>  The
ambassador returned uninjured.
</p>
<p>
V.  The flight of the Athenians to Salamis had not been a willing
resort.  That gallant people had remained in Attica so long as they
could entertain any expectation of assistance from the Peloponnesus;
nor was it until compelled by despair at the inertness of their
allies, and the appearance of the Persians in Boeotia, that they had
removed to Salamis.
</p>
<p>
The singular and isolated policy of Sparta, which had curbed and
crippled, to an exclusive regard for Spartans, all the more generous
and daring principles of action, was never, perhaps, so odiously
displayed as in the present indifference to an ally that had so nobly
preferred the Grecian liberties to its own security.  The whole of the
Peloponnesus viewed with apathy the occupation of Attica, and the
Spartans were employed in completing the fortifications of the
isthmus.
</p>
<p>
The Athenians despatched messengers to Sparta, as did also Megara and
Plataea.  These ambassadors assumed a high and reproachful tone of
remonstrance.
</p>
<p>
They represented the conduct of the Athenians in rejecting the
overtures of the barbarians&mdash;they upbraided the Spartans with perfidy
for breaking the agreement to meet the enemy in Boeotia&mdash;they declared
the resentment of the Athenians at the violation of this compact,
demanded immediate supplies, and indicated the plains near Thria, a
village in Attica, as a fitting field of battle.
</p>
<p>
The ephors heard the remonstrance, but from day to day delayed an
answer.  The Spartans, according to Herodotus, were engaged in
celebrating the solemnities in honour of Hyacinthus and Apollo; and
this ceremonial might have sufficed as a plausible cause for
procrastination, according to all the usages and formalities of
Spartan manners.  But perhaps there might be another and a graver
reason for the delayed determination of the ephors.
</p>
<p>
When the isthmian fortifications were completed, the superstition of
the regent Cleombrotus, who had superintended their construction, was
alarmed by an eclipse, and he led back to Sparta the detachment he had
commanded in that quarter.  He returned but to die; and his son
Pausanias succeeded to the regency during the continued minority of
Pleistarchus, the infant heir of Leonidas <a href="#note-97" name="noteref-97"><small>97</small></a>.  If the funeral
solemnities on the death of a regent were similar to those bestowed
upon a deceased king, we can account at once for the delay of the
ephors, since the ten days which passed without reply to the
ambassadors exactly correspond in number with the ten days dedicated
to public mourning. <a href="#note-98" name="noteref-98"><small>98</small></a>  But whatever the cause of the Spartan delay
&mdash;and the rigid closeness of that oligarchic government kept, in yet
more important matters, its motives and its policy no less a secret to
contemporaneous nations than to modern inquirers&mdash;the delay itself
highly incensed the Athenian envoys: they even threatened to treat
with Mardonius, and abandon Sparta to her fate, and at length fixed
the day of their departure.  The ephors roused themselves.  Among the
deputies from the various states, there was then in Sparta that
Chileus of Tegea, who had been scarcely less serviceable than
Themistocles in managing the affairs of Greece in the isthmian
congress.  This able and eminent Arcadian forcibly represented to the
ephors the danger of forfeiting the Athenian alliance, and the
insufficient resistance against the Persian that the fortifications of
the isthmus would afford.  The ephors heard, and immediately acted
with the secrecy and the vigilance that belongs to oligarchies.  That
very night they privately despatched a body of five thousand Spartans
and thirty-five thousand helots (seven to each Spartan), under the
command of Pausanias.
</p>
<p>
The next morning the ephors calmly replied to the angry threats of the
Athenians, by protesting that their troops were already on the march,
and by this time in Oresteum, a town in Arcadia, about eighteen miles
distant from Sparta.  The astonished deputies <a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99"><small>99</small></a> hastened to
overtake the Spartan force, and the ephors, as if fully to atone for
their past procrastination, gave them the escort and additional
re-enforcement of five thousand heavy-armed Laconians or Perioeci.
</p>
<p>
VI.  Mardonius soon learned from the Argives (who, not content with
refusing to join the Greek legion, had held secret communications with
the Persians) of the departure of the Spartan troops.  Hitherto he had
refrained from any outrage on the Athenian lands and city, in the hope
that Athens might yet make peace with him.  He now set fire to Athens,
razed the principal part of what yet remained of the walls and temples
<a href="#note-100" name="noteref-100"><small>100</small></a>, and deeming the soil of Attica ill adapted to his cavalry, and,
from the narrowness of its outlets, disadvantageous in case of
retreat, after a brief incursion into Megara he retired towards
Thebes, and pitched his tents on the banks of the Asopus, extending
from Erythrae to Plataea.  Here his force was swelled by such of the
Greeks as were friendly to his cause.
</p>
<p>
VII.  Meanwhile the Spartans were joined at the isthmus by the rest of
the Peloponnesian allies.  Solemn sacrifices were ordained, and the
auguries drawn from the victims being favourable, the Greek army
proceeded onward; and, joined at Eleusis by the Athenians, marched to
the foot of Cithaeron, and encamped opposite the Persians, with the
river of the Asopus between the armies.  Aristides commanded the
Athenians, at the head of eight thousand foot; and while the armies
were thus situated, a dangerous conspiracy was detected and defeated
by that able general.
</p>
<p>
The disasters of the war&mdash;the devastation of lands, the burning of
houses&mdash;had reduced the fortunes of many of the Athenian nobles.  With
their property diminished their influence.  Poverty, and discontent,
and jealousy of new families rising into repute <a href="#note-101" name="noteref-101"><small>101</small></a>, induced these
men of fallen fortunes to conspire for the abolition of the popular
government at Athens, and, failing that attempt, to betray the cause
to the enemy.
</p>
<p>
This project spread secretly through the camp, and corrupted numbers;
the danger became imminent.  On the one hand, the conspiracy was not
to be neglected; and, on the other, in such a crisis it might be
dangerous too narrowly to sift a design in which men of mark and
station were concerned.  Aristides acted with a singular prudence.  He
arrested eight of the leaders.  Of these he prosecuted only two (who
escaped during the proceedings), and, dismissing the rest, appealed to
the impending battle as the great tribunal which would acquit them of
the charge and prove their loyalty to the state. <a href="#note-102" name="noteref-102"><small>102</small></a>
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Scarce was this conspiracy quelled than the cavalry of the
Persians commenced their operations.  At the head of that skilful and
gallant horse, for which the oriental nations are yet renowned, rode
their chief, Masistius, clad in complete armour of gold, of brass, and
of iron, and noted for the strength of his person and the splendour of
his trappings.  Placed on the rugged declivities of Cithaeron, the
Greeks were tolerably safe from the Persian cavalry, save only the
Megarians, who, to the number of three thousand, were posted along the
plain, and were on all sides charged by that agile and vapid cavalry.
Thus pressed, the Megarians sent to Pausanias for assistance.  The
Spartan beheld the air darkened with shafts and arrows, and knew that
his heavy-armed warriors were ill adapted to act against horse.  He in
vain endeavoured to arouse those about him by appeals to their honour
&mdash;all declined the succour of the Megarians&mdash;when Aristides, causing
the Athenian to eclipse the Spartan chivalry, undertook the defence.
With three hundred infantry, mixed with archers, Olympiodorus, one of
the ablest of the Athenian officers, advanced eagerly on the
barbarian.
</p>
<p>
Masistius himself, at the head of his troops, spurred his Nisaean
charger against the new enemy.  A sharp and obstinate conflict ensued;
when the horse of the Persian general, being wounded, threw its rider,
who could not regain his feet from the weight of his armour.  There,
as he lay on the ground, with a swarm of foes around him, the close
scales of his mail protected him from their weapons, until at length a
lance pierced the brain through an opening in his visor.  After an
obstinate conflict for his corpse, the Persians were beaten back to
the camp, where the death of one, second only to Mardonius in
authority and repute, spread universal lamentation and dismay.
</p>
<p>
The body of Masistius, which, by its vast size and beautiful
proportions, excited the admiration of the victors, remained the prize
of the Greeks; and, placed on a bier, it was borne triumphantly
through the ranks.
</p>
<p>
IX.  After this victory, Pausanias conducted his forces along the base
of Cithaeron into the neighbourhood of Plataea, which he deemed a more
convenient site for the disposition of his army and the supply of
water.  There, near the fountain of Gargaphia <a href="#note-103" name="noteref-103"><small>103</small></a>, one of the
sources of the Asopus (which splits into many rivulets, bearing a
common name), and renowned in song for the death of the fabulous
Actaeon, nor far from the shrine of an old Plataean hero
(Androcrates), the Greeks were marshalled in regular divisions, the
different nations, some on a gentle acclivity, others along the plain.
</p>
<p>
In the allotment of the several stations a dispute arose between the
Athenians and the Tegeans.  The latter claimed, from ancient and
traditionary prescription, the left wing (the right being unanimously
awarded to the Spartans), and assumed, in the course of their
argument, an insolent superiority over the Athenians.
</p>
<p>
"We came here to fight," answered the Athenians (or Aristides in their
name <a href="#note-104" name="noteref-104"><small>104</small></a>), "and not to dispute.  But since the Tegeans proclaim
their ancient as well as their modern deeds, fit is it for us to
maintain our precedence over the Arcadians."
</p>
<p>
Touching slightly on the ancient times referred to by the Tegeans, and
quoting their former deeds, the Athenians insisted chiefly upon
Marathon; "Yet," said their orators, or orator, in conclusion, "while
we maintain our right to the disputed post, it becomes us not, at this
crisis, to altercate on the localities of the battle.  Place us, oh
Spartans! wherever seems best to you.  No matter what our station; we
will uphold our honour and your cause.  Command, then&mdash;we obey."
</p>
<p>
Hearing this generous answer, the Spartan leaders were unanimous in
favour of the Athenians; and they accordingly occupied the left wing.
</p>
<p>
X.  Thus were marshalled that confederate army, presenting the
strongest force yet opposed to the Persians, and comprising the whole
might and manhood of the free Grecian states; to the right, ten
thousand Lacedaemonians, one half, as we have seen, composed of the
Perioeci, the other moiety of the pure Spartan race&mdash;to each warrior
of the latter half were allotted seven armed helots, to each of the
heavy-armed Perioeci one serving-man.  Their whole force was,
therefore, no less than fifty thousand men.  Next to the Spartans (a
kind of compromise of their claim) were the one thousand five hundred
Tegeans; beyond these five thousand Corinthians; and to them
contiguous three hundred Potidaeans of Pallene, whom the inundation of
their seas had saved from the Persian arms.  Next in order, Orchomenus
ranged its six hundred Arcadians; Sicyon sent three thousand,
Epidaurus eight hundred, and Troezene one thousand warriors.
Neighbouring the last were two hundred Lepreatae, and by them four
hundred Myceneans and Tirynthians <a href="#note-105" name="noteref-105"><small>105</small></a>.  Stationed by the Tirynthians
came, in successive order, a thousand Phliasians, three hundred
Hermionians, six hundred Eretrians and Styreans, four hundred
Chalcidians, five hundred Ambracians, eight hundred Leucadians and
Anactorians, two hundred Paleans of Cephallenia, and five hundred only
of the islanders of Aegina.  Three thousand Megarians and six hundred
Plataeans were ranged contiguous to the Athenians, whose force of
eight thousand men, under the command of Aristides, closed the left
wing.
</p>
<p>
Thus the total of the heavy-armed soldiery was thirty-eight thousand
seven hundred.  To these were added the light-armed force of
thirty-five thousand helots and thirty-four thousand five hundred
attendants on the Laconians and other Greeks; the whole amounting to one
hundred and eight thousand two hundred men, besides one thousand eight
hundred Thespians, who, perhaps, on account of the destruction of their
city by the Persian army, were without the heavy arms of their
confederates.
</p>
<p>
Such was the force&mdash;not insufficient in number, but stronger in heart,
union, the memory of past victories, and the fear of future chains&mdash;
that pitched the tent along the banks of the rivulets which confound
with the Asopus their waters and their names.
</p>
<p>
XI.  In the interim Mardonius had marched from his former post, and
lay encamped on that part of the Asopus nearest to Plataea.  His brave
Persians fronted the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans; and, in successive
order, ranged the Medes and Bactrians, the Indians and the Sacae, the
Boeotians, Locrians, Malians, Thessalians, Macedonians, and the
reluctant aid of a thousand Phocians.  But many of the latter tribe
about the fastnesses of Parnassus, openly siding with the Greeks,
harassed the barbarian outskirts: Herodotus calculates the hostile
force at three hundred and fifty thousand, fifty thousand of which
were composed of Macedonians and Greeks.  And, although the historian
has omitted to deduct from this total the loss sustained by Artabazus
at Potidaea, it is yet most probable that the barbarian nearly trebled
the Grecian army&mdash;odds less fearful than the Greeks had already met
and vanquished.
</p>
<p>
XII.  The armies thus ranged, sacrifices were offered up on both
sides.  It happened, by a singular coincidence, that to either army
was an Elean augur.  The appearance of the entrails forbade both
Persian and Greek to cross the Asopus, and ordained each to act on the
defensive.
</p>
<p>
That the Persian chief should have obeyed the dictates of a Grecian
soothsayer is sufficiently probable; partly because a superstitious
people rarely despise the superstitions of another faith, principally
because a considerable part of the invading army, and that perhaps the
bravest and the most skilful, was composed of native Greeks, whose
prejudices it was politic to flatter&mdash;perilous to affront.
</p>
<p>
Eight days were consumed in inactivity, the armies confronting each
other without motion; when Mardonius, in order to cut off the new
forces which every day resorted to the Grecian camp, despatched a body
of cavalry to seize the pass of Cithaeron.  Falling in with a convoy
of five hundred beasts of burden, carrying provisions from the
Peloponnesus, the barbarians, with an inhumanity sufficient, perhaps,
to prove that the detachment was not composed of Persians, properly so
speaking, a mild though gallant people&mdash;slaughtered both man and
beast.  The provisions were brought to the Persian camp.
</p>
<p>
XIII.  During the two following days Mardonius advanced nearer to the
Asopus, and his cavalry (assisted by the Thebans, who were the right
arm of the barbarian army), in repeated skirmishes, greatly harassed
the Greeks with much daring and little injury.
</p>
<p>
At length Mardonius, either wearied of this inactivity or unable to
repress the spirit of a superior army, not accustomed to receive the
attack, resolved to reject all further compliance with the oracles of
this Elean soothsayer, and, on the following morning, to give battle
to the Greeks.  Acting against one superstition, he sagaciously,
however, sought to enlist on his behalf another; and, from the
decision of a mortal, he appealed to the ambiguous oracles of the
Delphic god, which had ever one interpretation for the enterprise and
another for the success.
</p>
<p>
XIV.  "The watches of the night were set," says Herodotus, in his
animated and graphic strain&mdash;"the night itself was far advanced&mdash;a
universal and utter stillness prevailed throughout the army, buried in
repose&mdash;when Alexander, the Macedonian prince, rode secretly from the
Persian camp, and, coming to the outposts of the Athenians, whose line
was immediately opposed to his own, demanded an audience of their
commanders.  This obtained, the Macedonian thus addressed them: 'I am
come to inform you of a secret you must impart to Pausanias alone.
From remote antiquity I am of Grecian lineage.  I am solicitous of the
safety of Greece.  Long since, but for the auguries, would Mardonius
have given battle.  Regarding these no longer, he will attack you
early on the morning.  Be prepared.  If he change his purpose, remain
as you are&mdash;he has provisions only for a few days more.  Should the
event of war prove favourable, you will but deem it fitting to make
some effort for the independence of one who exposes himself to so
great a peril for the purpose of apprizing you of the intentions of
the foe.  I am Alexander of Macedon.'"
</p>
<p>
"Thus saying, the horseman returned to the Persian camp."
</p>
<p>
"The Athenian leaders hastened to Pausanias, and informed him of what
they had heard."
</p>
<p>
The Spartan does not appear, according to the strong expressions <a href="#note-106" name="noteref-106"><small>106</small></a>
of Herodotus, to have received the intelligence with the customary
dauntlessness of his race.  He feared the Persians, he was
unacquainted with their mode of warfare, and he proposed to the
Athenians to change posts with the Lacedaemonians; "For you," said he,
"have before contended with the Mede, and your experience of their
warfare you learned at Marathon.  We, on the other hand, have fought
against the Boeotians and Thessalians [opposed to the left wing].  Let
us then change our stations."
</p>
<p>
At first the Athenian officers were displeased at the offer, not from
terror, but from pride; and it seemed to them as if they were shifted,
like helots, from post to post at the Spartan's pleasure.  But
Aristides, whose power of persuasion consisted chiefly in appeals, not
to the baser, but the loftier passions, and who, in swaying, exalted
his countrymen&mdash;represented to them that the right wing, which the
Spartan proposed to surrender, was, in effect, the station of command.
</p>
<p>
"And are you," he said, "not pleased with the honour you obtain, nor
sensible of the advantage of contending, not against the sons of
Greece, but the barbarian invader?" <a href="#note-107" name="noteref-107"><small>107</small></a>
</p>
<p>
These words animated those whom the Athenian addressed; they instantly
agreed to exchange posts with the Spartans, and "to fight for the
trophies of Marathon and Salamis." <a href="#note-108" name="noteref-108"><small>108</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XV.  As, in the dead of night, the Athenians marched to their new
station, they exhorted each other to valour and to the recollection of
former victories.  But Mardonius, learning from deserters the change
of position, moved his Persians opposite the Spartans; and Pausanias
again returning to the right, Mardonius pursued a similar manoeuvre.
Thus the day was consumed without an action.  The troops having
resumed their former posts, Mardonius sent a herald to the Spartans,
chiding them for their cowardice, and proposing that an allotted
number meet equal Spartans in battle, and whoever conquered should be
deemed victors over the whole adverse army.
</p>
<p>
This challenge drew no reply from the Spartans.  And Mardonius,
construing the silence into a proof of fear, already anticipated the
victory.  His cavalry, advancing upon the Greeks, distressed them from
afar and in safety with their shafts and arrows.  They succeeded in
gaining the Gargaphian fountain, which supplied water to the Grecian
army, and choked up the stream.  Thus cut off from water, and, at the
same time, yet more inconvenienced by the want of provisions, the
convoy of which was intercepted by the Persian cavalry, the Grecian
chiefs determined to shift the ground, and occupy a space which, being
surrounded by rivulets, was termed the Island of Oeroe <a href="#note-109" name="noteref-109"><small>109</small></a>, and
afforded an ample supply of water.  This island was about a mile from
their present encampment: thence they proposed to detach half their
army to relieve a convoy of provisions encompassed in the mountains.
</p>
<p>
About four hours after sunset the army commenced its march; but when
Pausanias gave the word to his Spartans, one officer, named
Amompharetus, obstinately refused to stir.  He alleged the customs and
oaths of Sparta, and declared he would not fly from the barbarian foe,
nor connive at the dishonour of Sparta.
</p>
<p>
XVI.  Pausanias, though incensed at the obstinacy of the officer, was
unwilling to leave him and his troop to perish; and while the dispute
was still unsettled, the Athenians, suspicious of their ally, "for
they knew well it was the custom of Spartans to say one thing and to
think another," <a href="#note-110" name="noteref-110"><small>110</small></a> despatched a horseman to Pausanias to learn the
cause of the delay.  The messenger found the soldiers in their ranks;
the leaders in violent altercation.  Pausanias was arguing with
Amompharetus, when the last, just as the Athenian approached, took up
a huge stone with both hands, and throwing it at the feet of
Pausanias, vehemently exclaimed, "With this calculus I give my
suffrage against flying from the stranger."  Pausanias, in great
perplexity, bade the Athenian report the cause of the delay, and
implore his countrymen to halt a little, that they might act in
concert.  At length, towards morning, Pausanias resolved, despite
Amompharetus, to commence his march.  All his forces proceeded along
the steep defiles at the base of Cithaeron, from fear of the Persian
cavalry; the more dauntless Athenians along the plain.  Amompharetus,
after impotent attempts to detain his men, was reluctantly compelled
to follow.
</p>
<p>
XVII.  Mardonius, beholding the vacant ground before him no longer
bristling with the Grecian ranks, loudly vented his disdain of the
cowardice of the fugitives, and instantly led his impatient army over
the Asopus in pursuit.  As yet, the Athenians, who had already passed
the plain, were concealed by the hills; and the Tegeans and
Lacedaemonians were the sole object of attack.
</p>
<p>
As the troops of Mardonius advanced, the rest of the Persian armament,
deeming the task was now not to fight but to pursue, raised their
standards and poured forward tumultuously, without discipline or
order.
</p>
<p>
Pausanias, pressed by the Persian line, and if not of a timorous, at
least of an irresolute temper, lost no time in sending to the
Athenians for succour.  But when the latter were on their march with
the required aid, they were suddenly intercepted by the auxiliary
Greeks in the Persian service, and cut off from the rescue of the
Spartans.
</p>
<p>
The Spartans beheld themselves thus left unsupported with considerable
alarm.  Yet their force, including the Tegeans and helots, was
fifty-three thousand men.  Committing himself to the gods, Pausanias
ordained a solemn sacrifice, his whole army awaiting the result, while
the shafts of the Persian bowmen poured on them near and fast.  But
the entrails presented discouraging omens, and the sacrifice was again
renewed.  Meanwhile the Spartans evinced their characteristic
fortitude and discipline&mdash;not one man stirring from his ranks until
the auguries should assume a more favouring aspect; all harassed, and
some wounded, by the Persian arrows, they yet, seeking protection only
beneath their broad bucklers, waited with a stern patience the time of
their leader and of Heaven.  Then fell Callicrates, the stateliest and
strongest soldier in the whole army, lamenting, not death, but that
his sword was as yet undrawn against the invader.
</p>
<p>
XVIII.  And still sacrifice after sacrifice seemed to forbid the
battle, when Pausanias, lifting his eyes, that streamed with tears, to
the temple of Juno that stood  hard by, supplicated the tutelary
goddess of Cithaeron, that if the fates forbade the Greeks to conquer,
they might at least fall like warriors <a href="#note-111" name="noteref-111"><small>111</small></a>.  And while uttering this
prayer, the tokens waited for became suddenly visible in the victims,
and the augurs announced the promise of coming victory.
</p>
<p>
Therewith the order of battle rang instantly through the army, and, to
use the poetical comparison of Plutarch, the Spartan phalanx suddenly
stood forth in its strength, like some fierce animal&mdash;erecting its
bristles and preparing its vengeance for the foe.  The ground, broken
in many steep and precipitous ridges, and intersected by the Asopus,
whose sluggish stream <a href="#note-112" name="noteref-112"><small>112</small></a> winds over a broad and rushy bed, was
unfavourable to the movements of cavalry, and the Persian foot
advanced therefore on the Greeks.
</p>
<p>
Drawn up in their massive phalanx, the Lacedaemonians presented an
almost impenetrable body&mdash;sweeping slowly on, compact and serried&mdash;
while the hot and undisciplined valour of the Persians, more fortunate
in the skirmish than the battle, broke itself into a thousand waves
upon that moving rock.  Pouring on in small numbers at a time, they
fell fast round the progress of the Greeks&mdash;their armour slight
against the strong pikes of Sparta&mdash;their courage without skill&mdash;their
numbers without discipline; still they fought gallantly, even when on
the ground seizing the pikes with their naked hands, and with the
wonderful agility which still characterizes the oriental swordsman,
springing to their feet and regaining their arms when seemingly
overcome&mdash;wresting away their enemies' shields, and grappling with
them desperately hand to hand.
</p>
<p>
XIX.  Foremost of a band of a thousand chosen Persians, conspicuous by
his white charger, and still more by his daring valour, rode
Mardonius, directing the attack&mdash;fiercer wherever his armour blazed.
Inspired by his presence, the Persians fought worthily of their
warlike fame, and, even in falling, thinned the Spartan ranks.  At
length the rash but gallant leader of the Asiatic armies received a
mortal wound&mdash;his scull was crushed in by a stone from the hand of a
Spartan <a href="#note-113" name="noteref-113"><small>113</small></a>.  His chosen band, the boast of the army, fell fighting
round him, but his death was the general signal of defeat and flight.
Encumbered by their long robes, and pressed by the relentless
conquerors, the Persians fled in disorder towards their camp, which
was secured by wooden intrenchments, by gates, and towers, and walls.
Here, fortifying themselves as they best might, they contended
successfully, and with advantage, against the Lacedaemonians, who were
ill skilled in assault and siege.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the Athenians obtained the victory on the plains over the
Greeks of Mardonius&mdash;finding their most resolute enemy in the Thebans
(three hundred of whose principal warriors fell in the field)&mdash;and now
joined the Spartans at the Persian camp.  The Athenians are said to
have been better skilled in the art of siege than the Spartans; yet at
that time their experience could scarcely have been greater.  The
Athenians were at all times, however, of a more impetuous temper; and
the men who had "run to the charge" at Marathon were not to be baffled
by the desperate remnant of their ancient foe.  They scaled the walls
&mdash;they effected a breach through which the Tegeans were the first to
rush&mdash;the Greeks poured fast and fierce into the camp.  Appalled,
dismayed, stupefied by the suddenness and greatness of their loss, the
Persians no longer sustained their fame&mdash;they dispersed themselves in
all directions, falling, as they fled, with a prodigious slaughter, so
that out of that mighty armament scarce three thousand effected an
escape.  We must except, however, the wary and distrustful Artabazus,
who, on the first tokens of defeat, had fled with the forty thousand
Parthians and Chorasmians he commanded towards Phocis, in the
intention to gain the Hellespont.  The Mantineans arrived after the
capture of the camp, too late for their share of glory; they
endeavoured to atone the loss by the pursuit of Artabazus, which was,
however, ineffectual.  The Eleans arrived after the Mantineans.  The
leaders of both these people were afterward banished.
</p>
<p>
XX.  An Aeginetan proposed to Pausanias to inflict on the corpse of
Mardonius the same insult which Xerxes had put upon the body of
Leonidas.
</p>
<p>
The Spartan indignantly refused.  "After elevating my country to
fame," said he, "would you have me depress it to infamy by vengeance
on the body of the dead?  Leonidas and Thermopylae are sufficiently
avenged by this mighty overthrow of the living."
</p>
<p>
The body of that brave and ill-fated general, the main author of the
war, was removed the next day&mdash;by whose piety and to what sepulchre is
unknown.  The tomb of his doubtful fame is alone eternally visible
along the plains of Plataea, and above the gray front of the
imperishable Cithaeron!
</p>
<p>
XXI.  The victory won (September, B. C. 479), the conquerors were
dazzled by the gorgeous plunder which remained&mdash;tents and couches
decorated with precious metals&mdash;cups, and vessels, and sacks of gold&mdash;
and the dead themselves a booty, from the costly ornaments of their
chains and bracelets, and cimeters vainly splendid&mdash;horses, and
camels, and Persian women, and all the trappings and appliances by
which despotism made a luxury of war.
</p>
<p>
Pausanias forbade the booty to be touched <a href="#note-114" name="noteref-114"><small>114</small></a>, and directed the
helots to collect the treasure in one spot.  But those dexterous
slaves secreted many articles of value, by the purchase of which
several of the Aeginetans, whose avarice was sharpened by a life of
commerce, enriched themselves&mdash;obtaining gold at the price of brass.
</p>
<p>
Piety dedicated to the gods a tenth part of the booty&mdash;from which was
presented to the shrine of Delphi a golden tripod, resting on a
three-headed snake of brass; to the Corinthian Neptune a brazen state of
the deity, seven cubits high; and to the Jupiter of Olympia a statue of
ten cubits.  Pausanias obtained also a tenth of the produce in each
article of plunder&mdash;horses and camels, women and gold&mdash;a prize which
ruined in rewarding him.  The rest was divided among the soldiers,
according to their merit.
</p>
<p>
So much, however, was left unappropriated in the carelessness of
satiety, that, in after times, the battlefield still afforded to the
search of the Plataeans chests of silver and gold, and other
treasures.
</p>
<p>
XXIL Taking possession of the tent of Mardonius, which had formerly
been that of Xerxes, Pausanias directed the oriental slaves who had
escaped the massacre to prepare a banquet after the fashion of the
Persians, and as if served to Mardonius.  Besides this gorgeous feast,
the Spartan ordered his wonted repast to be prepared; and then,
turning to the different chiefs, exclaimed&mdash;"See the folly of the
Persian, who forsook such splendour to plunder such poverty."
</p>
<p>
The story has in it something of the sublime.  But the austere Spartan
was soon corrupted by the very luxuries he affected to disdain.  It is
often that we despise to-day what we find it difficult to resist
to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
XXIII.  The task of reward to the living completed, the Greeks
proceeded to that of honour to the dead.  In three trenches the
Lacedaemonians were interred; one contained those who belonged to a
class in Sparta called the Knights <a href="#note-115" name="noteref-115"><small>115</small></a>, of whom two hundred had
conducted Themistocles to Tegea (among these was the stubborn
Amompharetus); the second, the other Spartans; the third, the helots.
The Athenians, Tegeans, Megarians, Phliasians, each had their single
and separate places of sepulture, and, over all, barrows of earth were
raised.  Subsequently, tribes and states, that had shared indeed the
final battle or the previous skirmishes, but without the glory of a
loss of life, erected cenotaphs to imaginary dead in that illustrious
burial-field.  Among those spurious monuments was one dedicated to the
Aeginetans.  Aristodemus, the Spartan who had returned safe from
Thermopylae, fell at Plataea, the most daring of the Greeks on that
day, voluntarily redeeming a dishonoured life by a glorious death.
But to his manes alone of the Spartan dead no honours were decreed.
</p>
<p>
XXIV.  Plutarch relates that a dangerous dispute ensued between the
Spartans and Athenians as to their relative claim to the Aristeia, or
first military honours; the question was decided by awarding them to
the Plataeans&mdash;a state of which none were jealous; from a similar
motive, ordinary men are usually found possessed of the honours due to
the greatest.
</p>
<p>
More important than the Aristeia, had the spirit been properly
maintained, were certain privileges then conferred on Plataea.
Thither, in a subsequent assembly of the allies, it was proposed by
Aristides that deputies from the states of Greece should be annually
sent to sacrifice to Jupiter the Deliverer, and confer upon the
general politics of Greece.  There, every fifth year, should be
celebrated games in honour of Liberty; while the Plataeans themselves,
exempted from military service, should be deemed, so long as they
fulfilled the task thus imposed upon them, a sacred and inviolable
people.  Thus Plataea nominally became a second Elis&mdash;its battle-field
another Altis.  Aristides, at the same time, sought to enforce the
large and thoughtful policy commenced by Themistocles.  He endeavoured
to draw the jealous states of Greece into a common and perpetual
league, maintained against all invaders by a standing force of one
thousand cavalry, one hundred ships, and ten thousand heavy-armed
infantry.
</p>
<p>
XXV.  An earnest and deliberate council was now held, in which it was
resolved to direct the victorious army against Thebes, and demand the
persons of those who had sided with the Mede.  Fierce as had been the
hostility of that state to the Hellenic liberties, its sin was that of
the oligarchy rather than the people.  The most eminent of these
traitors to Greece were Timagenidas and Attaginus, and the allies
resolved to destroy the city unless those chiefs were given up to
justice.
</p>
<p>
On the eleventh day from the battle they sat down before Thebes, and
on the refusal of the inhabitants to surrender the chiefs so justly
obnoxious, laid waste the Theban lands.
</p>
<p>
Whatever we may think of the conduct of Timagenidas in espousing the
cause of the invaders of Greece, we must give him the praise of a
disinterested gallantry, which will remind the reader of the siege of
Calais by Edward III., and the generosity of Eustace de St. Pierre.
He voluntarily proposed to surrender himself to the besiegers.
</p>
<p>
The offer was accepted: Timagenidas and several others were delivered
to Pausanias, removed to Corinth, and there executed&mdash;a stern but
salutary example.  Attaginus saved himself by flight.  His children,
given up to Pausanias, were immediately dismissed.  "Infants," said
the Spartan, "could not possibly have conspired against us with the
Mede."
</p>
<p>
While Thebes preserved herself from destruction, Artabazus succeeded
in effecting his return to Asia, his troop greatly reduced by the
attacks of the Thracians, and the excesses of famine and fatigue.
</p>
<p>
XXVI.  On the same day as that on which the battle of Plataea crushed
the land-forces of Persia, a no less important victory was gained over
their fleet at Mycale in Ionia.
</p>
<p>
It will be remembered that Leotychides, the Spartan king, and the
Athenian Xanthippus, had conducted the Grecian navy to Delos.  There
anchored, they received a deputation from Samos, among whom was
Hegesistratus, the son of Aristagoras.  These ambassadors declared
that all the Ionians waited only the moment to revolt from the Persian
yoke, and that the signal would be found in the first active measures
of the Grecian confederates.  Leotychides, induced by these
representations, received the Samians into the general league, and set
sail to Samos.  There, drawn up in line of battle, near the temple of
Juno, they prepared to hazard an engagement.
</p>
<p>
But the Persians, on their approach, retreated to the continent, in
order to strengthen themselves with their land-forces, which, to the
amount of sixty thousand, under the command of the Persian Tigranes,
Xerxes had stationed at Mycale for the protection of Ionia.
</p>
<p>
Arrived at Mycale, they drew their ships to land, fortifying them with
strong intrenchments and barricades, and then sanguinely awaited the
result.
</p>
<p>
The Greeks, after a short consultation, resolved upon pursuit.
Approaching the enemy's station, they beheld the sea deserted, the
ships secured by intrenchments, and long ranks of infantry ranged
along the shore.  Leotychides, by a herald, exhorted the Ionians in
the Persian service to remember their common liberties, and that on
the day of battle their watchword would be "Hebe."
</p>
<p>
The Persians, distrusting these messages, though uttered in a tongue
they understood not, and suspecting the Samians, took their arms from
the latter; and, desirous of removing the Milesians to a distance,
intrusted them with the guard of the paths to the heights of Mycale.
Using these precautions against the desertion of their allies, the
Persians prepared for battle.
</p>
<p>
The Greeks were anxious and fearful not so much for themselves as for
their countrymen in Boeotia, opposed to the mighty force of Mardonius.
But a report spreading through the camp that a complete victory had
been obtained in that territory (an artifice, most probably, of
Leotychides), animated their courage and heightened their hopes.
</p>
<p>
The Athenians, who, with the troops of Corinth, Sicyon, and Troezene,
formed half the army, advanced by the coast and along the plain&mdash;the
Lacedaemonians by the more steep and wooded courses; and while the
latter were yet on their march, the Athenians were already engaged at
the intrenchments (Battle of Mycale, September, B. C. 479).
</p>
<p>
Inspired not more by enmity than emulation, the Athenians urged each
other to desperate feats&mdash;that they, and not the Spartans, might have
the honours of the day.  They poured fiercely on&mdash;after an obstinate
and equal conflict, drove back the foe to the barricades that girt
their ships, stormed the intrenchments, carried the wall, and, rushing
in with their allies, put the barbarians to disorderly and rapid
flight.  The proper Persians, though but few in number, alone stood
their ground&mdash;and even when Tigranes himself was slain, resolutely
fought on until the Lacedaemonians entered the intrenchment, and all
who had survived the Athenian, perished by the Spartan, sword.
</p>
<p>
The disarmed Samians, as soon as the fortunes of the battle became
apparent, gave all the assistance they could render to the Greeks; the
other Ionians seized the same opportunity to revolt and turn their
arms against their allies.  In the mountain defiles the Milesians
intercepted their own fugitive allies, consigning them to the Grecian
sword, and active beyond the rest in their slaughter.  So relentless
and so faithless are men, compelled to servitude, when the occasion
summons them to be free.
</p>
<p>
XXVII.  This battle, in which the Athenians were pre-eminently
distinguished, was followed up by the conflagration of the Persian
ships and the collection of the plunder.  The Greeks then retired to
Samos.  Here deliberating, it was proposed by the Peloponnesian
leaders that Ionia should henceforth, as too dangerous and remote to
guard, be abandoned to the barbarian, and that, in recompense, the
Ionians should be put into possession of the maritime coasts of those
Grecian states which had sided with the Mede.  The Athenians resisted
so extreme a proposition, and denied the power of the Peloponnesians
to dispose of Athenian colonies.  The point was surrendered by the
Peloponnesians; the Ionians of the continent were left to make their
own terms with the barbarian, but the inhabitants of the isles which
had assisted against the Mede were received into the general
confederacy, bound by a solemn pledge never to desert it.  The fleet
then sailed to the Hellespont, with the design to destroy the bridge,
which they believed still existent.  Finding it, however, already
broken, Leotychides and the Peloponnesians returned to Greece.  The
Athenians resolved to attempt the recovery of the colony of Miltiades
in the Chersonese.  The Persians collected their whole remaining force
at the strongest hold in that peninsula&mdash;the Athenians laid siege to
it (begun in the autumn, B. C. 479, concluded in the spring, B. C.
478), and, after enduring a famine so obstinate that the cordage, or
rather straps, of their bedding were consumed for food, the Persians
evacuated the town, which the inhabitants then cheerfully surrendered.
</p>
<p>
Thus concluding their victories, the Athenians returned to Greece,
carrying with them a vast treasure, and, not the least precious
relics, the fragments and cables of the Hellespontic bridge, to be
suspended in their temples.
</p>
<p>
XXVIII.  Lingering at Sardis, Xerxes beheld the scanty and exhausted
remnants of his mighty force, the fugitives of the fatal days of
Mycale and Plataea.  The army over which he had wept in the zenith of
his power, had fulfilled the prediction of his tears: and the armed
might of Media and Egypt, of Lydia and Assyria, was now no more!
</p>
<p>
So concluded the great Persian invasion&mdash;that war the most memorable
in the history of mankind, whether from the vastness or from the
failure of its designs.  We now emerge from the poetry that belongs to
early Greece, through the mists of which the forms of men assume
proportions as gigantic as indistinct.  The enchanting Herodotus
abandons us, and we do not yet permanently acquire, in the stead of
his romantic and wild fidelity, the elaborate and sombre statesmanship
of the calm Thucydides.  Henceforth we see more of the beautiful and
the wise, less of the wonderful and vast.  What the heroic age is to
tradition, the Persian invasion is to history.

I.  It is to the imperishable honour of the French philosophers of the
last century, that, above all the earlier teachers of mankind, they
advocated those profound and permanent interests of the human race
which are inseparably connected with a love of PEACE; that they
stripped the image of WAR of the delusive glory which it took, in the
primitive ages of society, from the passions of savages and the
enthusiasm of poets, and turned our contemplation from the fame of the
individual hero to the wrongs of the butchered millions.  But their
zeal for that HUMANITY, which those free and bold thinkers were the
first to make the vital principle of a philosophical school, led them
into partial and hasty views, too indiscriminately embraced by their
disciples; and, in condemning the evils, they forgot the advantages of
war.  The misfortunes of one generation are often necessary to the
prosperity of another.  The stream of blood fertilizes the earth over
which it flows, and war has been at once the scourge and the civilizer
of the world: sometimes it enlightens the invader, sometimes the
invaded; and forces into sudden and brilliant action the arts and the
virtues that are stimulated by the invention of necessity&mdash;matured by
the energy of distress.  What adversity is to individuals, war often
is to nations: uncertain in its consequences, it is true that, with
some, it subdues and crushes, but with others it braces and exalts.
Nor are the greater and more illustrious elements of character in men
or in states ever called prominently forth, without something of that
bitter and sharp experience which hardens the more robust properties
of the mind, which refines the more subtle and sagacious.  Even when
these&mdash;the armed revolutions of the world&mdash;are most terrible in their
results&mdash;destroying the greatness and the liberties of one people&mdash;
they serve, sooner or later, to produce a counteracting rise and
progress in the fortunes of another; as the sea here advances, there
recedes, swallowing up the fertilities of this shore to increase the
territories of that; and fulfilling, in its awful and appalling
agency, that mandate of human destinies which ordains all things to be
changed and nothing to be destroyed.  Without the invasion of Persia,
Greece might have left no annals, and the modern world might search in
vain for inspirations from the ancient.
</p>
<p>
II.  When the deluge of the Persian arms rolled back to its Eastern
bed, and the world was once more comparatively at rest, the continent
of Greece rose visibly and majestically above the rest of the
civilized earth.  Afar in the Latian plains, the infant state of Rome
was silently and obscurely struggling into strength against the
neighbouring and petty states in which the old Etrurian civilization
was rapidly passing to decay.  The genius of Gaul and Germany, yet
unredeemed from barbarism, lay scarce known, save where colonized by
Greeks, in the gloom of its woods and wastes.  The pride of Carthage
had been broken by a signal defeat in Sicily; and Gelo, the able and
astute tyrant of Syracuse, maintained in a Grecian colony the
splendour of the Grecian name.
</p>
<p>
The ambition of Persia, still the great monarchy of the world, was
permanently checked and crippled; the strength of generations had been
wasted, and the immense extent of the empire only served yet more to
sustain the general peace, from the exhaustion of its forces.  The
defeat of Xerxes paralyzed the East.
</p>
<p>
Thus Greece was left secure, and at liberty to enjoy the tranquillity
it had acquired, and to direct to the arts of peace the novel and
amazing energies which had been prompted by the dangers and exalted by
the victories of war.
</p>
<p>
III.  The Athenians, now returned to their city, saw before them the
arduous task of rebuilding its ruins and restoring its wasted lands.
The vicissitudes of the war had produced many silent and internal as
well as exterior changes.  Many great fortunes had been broken; and
the ancient spirit of the aristocracy had received no inconsiderable
shock in the power of new families; the fame of the baseborn and
democratic Themistocles, and the victories which a whole people had
participated, broke up much of the prescriptive and venerable sanctity
attached to ancestral names and to particular families.  This was
salutary to the spirit of enterprise in all classes.  The ambition of
the great was excited to restore, by some active means, their broken
fortunes and decaying influence&mdash;the energies of the humbler ranks,
already aroused by their new importance, were stimulated to maintain
and to increase it.  It was the very crisis in which a new direction
might be given to the habits and the character of a whole people; and
to seize all the advantages of that crisis, fate, in Themistocles, had
allotted to Athens a man whose qualities were not only pre-eminently
great in themselves, but peculiarly adapted to the circumstances of
the time.  And, as I have elsewhere remarked, it is indeed the nature
and prerogative of free states to concentrate the popular will into
something of the unity of despotism, by producing, one after another,
a series of representatives of the wants and exigences of the hour&mdash;
each leading his generation, but only while he sympathizes with its
will; and either baffling or succeeded by his rivals, not in
proportion as he excels or he is outshone in genius, but as he gives
or ceases to give to the widest range of the legislative power the
most concentrated force of the executive; thus uniting the desires of
the greatest number under the administration of the narrowest possible
control; the constitution popular&mdash;the government absolute, but,
responsible.
</p>
<p>
IV.  In the great events of the late campaign, we have lost sight of
the hero of Salamis <a href="#note-116" name="noteref-116"><small>116</small></a>.  But the Persian war was no sooner ended
than we find Themistocles the most prominent citizen of Athens&mdash;a
sufficient proof that his popularity had not yet diminished, and that
his absence from Plataea was owing to no popular caprice or party
triumph.
</p>
<p>
V.  In the sweeping revenge of Mardonius, even private houses had been
destroyed, excepting those which had served as lodgments for the
Persian nobles <a href="#note-117" name="noteref-117"><small>117</small></a>.  Little of the internal city, less of the
outward walls was spared.  As soon as the barbarians had quitted their
territory, the citizens flocked back with their slaves and families
from the various places of refuge; and the first care was to rebuild
the city.  They were already employed upon this necessary task, when
ambassadors arrived from Sparta, whose vigilant government, ever
jealous of a rival, beheld with no unreasonable alarm the increasing
navy and the growing fame of a people hitherto undeniably inferior to
the power of Lacedaemon.  And the fear that was secretly cherished by
that imperious nation was yet more anxiously nursed by the subordinate
allies <a href="#note-118" name="noteref-118"><small>118</small></a>.  Actuated by their own and the general apprehensions,
the Spartans therefore now requested the Athenians to desist from the
erection of their walls.  Nor was it without a certain grace, and a
plausible excuse, that the government of a city, itself unwalled,
inveighed against the policy of walls for Athens.  The Spartan
ambassadors urged that fortified towns would become strongholds to
the barbarian, should he again invade them; and the walls of Athens
might be no less useful to him than he had found the ramparts of
Thebes.  The Peloponnesus, they asserted, was the legitimate retreat
and the certain resource of all; and, unwilling to appear exclusively
jealous of Athens, they requested the Athenians not only to desist
from their own fortifications, but to join with them in razing every
fortification without the limit of the Peloponnesus.
</p>
<p>
It required not a genius so penetrating as that of Themistocles to
divine at once the motive of the demand, and the danger of a
peremptory refusal.  He persuaded the Athenians to reply that they
would send ambassadors to debate the affair; and dismissed the
Spartans without further explanation.  Themistocles next recommended
to the senate <a href="#note-119" name="noteref-119"><small>119</small></a> that he himself might be one of the ambassadors
sent to Sparta, and that those associated with him in the mission (for
it was not the custom of Greece to vest embassies in individuals)
should be detained at Athens until the walls were carried to a height
sufficient, at least, for ordinary defence.  He urged his countrymen
to suspend for this great task the completion of all private edifices
&mdash;nay, to spare no building, private or public, from which materials
might be adequately selected.  The whole population, slaves, women,
and children, were to assist in the labour.
</p>
<p>
VI.  This counsel adopted, he sketched an outline of the conduct he
himself intended to pursue, and departed for Sparta.  His colleagues,
no less important than Aristides, and Abronychus, a distinguished
officer in the late war, were to follow at the time agreed on.
</p>
<p>
Arrived in the Laconian capital, Themistocles demanded no public
audience, avoided all occasions of opening the questions in dispute,
and screened the policy of delay beneath the excuse that his
colleagues were not yet arrived&mdash;that he was incompetent to treat
without their counsel and concurrence&mdash;and that doubtless they would
speedily appear in Sparta.
</p>
<p>
When we consider the shortness of the distance between the states, the
communications the Spartans would receive from the neighbouring
Aeginetans, more jealous than themselves, and the astute and
proverbial sagacity of the Spartan council&mdash;it is impossible to
believe that, for so long a period as, with the greatest expedition,
must have elapsed from the departure of Themistocles to the necessary
progress in the fortifications, the ephors could have been ignorant of
the preparations at Athens or the designs of Themistocles.  I fear,
therefore, that we must believe, with Theopompus <a href="#note-120" name="noteref-120"><small>120</small></a>, that
Themistocles, the most expert briber of his time, heightened that
esteem which Thucydides assures us the Spartans bore him, by private
and pecuniary negotiations with the ephors.  At length, however, such
decided and unequivocal intelligence of the progress of the walls
arrived at Sparta, that the ephors could no longer feel or affect
incredulity.
</p>
<p>
Themistocles met the remonstrances of the Spartans by an appearance of
candour mingled with disdain.  "Why," said he, "give credit to these
idle rumours?  Send to Athens some messengers of your own, in whom you
can confide; let them inspect matters with their own eyes, and report
to you accordingly."
</p>
<p>
The ephors (not unreluctantly, if the assertion of Theopompus may be
credited) yielded to so plausible a suggestion, and in the mean while
the crafty Athenian despatched a secret messenger to Athens, urging
the government to detain the Spartan ambassadors with as little
semblance of design as possible, and by no means to allow their
departure until the safe return of their own mission to Sparta.  For
it was by no means improbable that, without such hostages, even the
ephors, however powerful and however influenced, might not be enabled,
when the Spartans generally were made acquainted with the deceit
practised upon them, to prevent the arrest of the Athenian delegates.
<a href="#note-121" name="noteref-121"><small>121</small></a>
</p>
<p>
At length the walls, continued night and day with incredible zeal and
toil, were sufficiently completed; and disguise, no longer possible,
was no longer useful.  Themistocles demanded the audience he had
hitherto deferred, and boldly avowed that Athens was now so far
fortified as to protect its citizens.  "In future," he added,
haughtily, "when Sparta or our other confederates send ambassadors to
Athens, let them address us as a people well versed in our own
interests and the interests of our common Greece.  When we deserted
Athens for our ships, we required and obtained no Lacedaemonian
succours to support our native valour; in all subsequent measures, to
whom have we shown ourselves inferior, whether in the council or the
field?  At present we have judged it expedient to fortify our city,
rendering it thus more secure for ourselves and our allies.  Nor would
it be possible, with a strength inferior to that of any rival power,
adequately to preserve and equally to adjust the balance of the
liberties of Greece." <a href="#note-122" name="noteref-122"><small>122</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Contending for this equality, he argued that either all the cities in
the Lacedaemonian league should be dismantled of their fortresses, or
that it should be conceded, that in erecting fortresses for herself
Athens had rightly acted.
</p>
<p>
VII.  The profound and passionless policy of Sparta forbade all
outward signs of unavailing and unreasonable resentment.  The
Spartans, therefore, replied with seeming courtesy, that "in their
embassy they had not sought to dictate, but to advise&mdash;that their
object was the common good;" and they accompanied their excuses with
professions of friendship for Athens, and panegyrics on the Athenian
valour in the recent war.  But the anger they forbore to show only
rankled the more bitterly within. <a href="#note-123" name="noteref-123"><small>123</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The ambassadors of either state returned home; and thus the mingled
firmness and craft of Themistocles, so well suited to the people with
whom he had to deal, preserved his country from the present jealousies
of a yet more deadly and implacable foe than the Persian king, and
laid the foundation of that claim of equality with the most eminent
state of Greece, which he hastened to strengthen and enlarge.
</p>
<p>
The ardour of the Athenians in their work of fortification had spared
no material which had the recommendation of strength.  The walls
everywhere presented, and long continued to exhibit, an evidence of
the haste in which they were built.  Motley and rough hewn, and
uncouthly piled, they recalled, age after age, to the traveller the
name of the ablest statesman and the most heroic days of Athens.
There, at frequent intervals, would he survey stones wrought in the
rude fashion of former times&mdash;ornaments borrowed from the antique
edifices demolished by the Mede&mdash;and frieze and column plucked from
dismantled sepulchres; so that even the dead contributed from their
tombs to the defence of Athens.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Encouraged by the new popularity and honours which followed the
success of his mission, Themistocles now began to consummate the vast
schemes he had formed, not only for the aggrandizement of his country,
but for the change in the manners of the citizens.  All that is left
to us of this wonderful man proves that, if excelled by others in
austere virtue or in dazzling accomplishment, he stands unrivalled for
the profound and far-sighted nature of his policy.  He seems, unlike
most of his brilliant countrymen, to have been little influenced by
the sallies of impulse or the miserable expediencies of faction&mdash;his
schemes denote a mind acting on gigantic systems; and it is
astonishing with what virtuous motives and with what prophetic art he
worked through petty and (individually considered) dishonest means to
grand and permanent results.  He stands out to the gaze of time, the
model of what a great and fortunate statesman should be, so long as
mankind have evil passions as well as lofty virtues, and the state
that he seeks to serve is surrounded by powerful and restless foes,
whom it is necessary to overreach where it is dangerous to offend.
</p>
<p>
In the year previous to the Persian war, Themistocles had filled the
office of archon <a href="#note-124" name="noteref-124"><small>124</small></a>, and had already in that year planned the
construction of a harbour in the ancient deme of Piraeus <a href="#note-125" name="noteref-125"><small>125</small></a>, for
the convenience of the fleet which Athens had formed.  Late events had
frustrated the continuance of the labour, and Themistocles now
resolved to renew and complete it, probably on a larger and more
elaborate scale.
</p>
<p>
The port of Phalerun had hitherto been the main harbour of Athens&mdash;one
wholly inadequate to the new navy she had acquired; another inlet,
Munychia, was yet more inconvenient.  But equally at hand was the
capacious, though neglected port of Piraeus, so formed by nature as to
permit of a perfect fortification against a hostile fleet.  Of
Piraeus, therefore, Themistocles now designed to construct the most
ample and the most advantageous harbour throughout all Greece.  He
looked upon this task as the foundation of his favourite and most
ambitious project, viz., the securing to Athens the sovereignty of the
sea. <a href="#note-126" name="noteref-126"><small>126</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The completion of the port&mdash;the increased navy which the construction
of the new harbour would induce&mdash;the fame already acquired by Athens
in maritime warfare, encouraging attention to naval discipline and
tactics&mdash;proffered a splendid opening to the ambition of a people at
once enterprising and commercial.  Themistocles hoped that the results
of his policy would enable the Athenians to gain over their own
offspring, the Ionian colonies, and by their means to deliver from the
Persian yoke, and permanently attach to the Athenian interest, all the
Asiatic Greeks.  Extending his views, he beheld the various insular
states united to Athens by a vast maritime power, severing themselves
from Lacedaemon, and following the lead of the Attican republic.  He
saw his native city thus supplanting, by a naval force, the long-won
pre-eminence and iron supremacy of Sparta upon land, and so extending
her own empire, while she sapped secretly and judiciously the
authority of the most formidable of her rivals.
</p>
<p>
IX.  But in the execution of these grand designs Themistocles could
not but anticipate considerable difficulties: first, in the jealousy
of the Spartans; and, secondly, in the popular and long-rooted
prejudices of the Athenians themselves.  Hitherto they had discouraged
maritime affairs, and their more popular leaders had directed
attention to agricultural pursuits.  We may suppose, too, that the
mountaineers, or agricultural party, not the least powerful, would
resist so great advantages to the faction of the coastmen, if
acquainted with all the results which the new policy would produce.
Nor could so experienced a leader of mankind be insensible of those
often not insalutary consequences of a free state in the changing
humours of a wide democracy&mdash;their impatience at pecuniary demands&mdash;
their quick and sometimes uncharitable apprehensions of the motives of
their advisers.  On all accounts it was necessary, therefore, to act
with as much caution as the task would admit&mdash;rendering the design
invidious neither to foreign nor to domestic jealousies.  Themistocles
seemed to have steered his course through every difficulty with his
usual address.  Stripping the account of Diodorus <a href="#note-127" name="noteref-127"><small>127</small></a> of its
improbable details, it appears credible at least that Themistocles
secured, in the first instance, the co-operation of Xanthippus and
Aristides, the heads of the great parties generally opposed to his
measures, and that he won the democracy to consent that the outline of
his schemes should not be submitted to the popular assembly, but to
the council of Five Hundred.  It is perfectly clear, however, that, as
soon as the plan was carried into active operation, the Athenians
could not, as Diodorus would lead us to suppose, have been kept in
ignorance of its nature; and all of the tale of Diodorus to which we
can lend our belief is, that the people permitted the Five Hundred to
examine the project, and that the popular assembly ratified the
approbation of that senate without inquiring the reasons upon which it
was founded.
</p>
<p>
X.  The next care of Themistocles was to anticipate the jealousy of
Sparta, and forestall her interference.  According to Diodorus, he
despatched, therefore, ambassadors to Lacedaemon, representing the
advantages of forming a port which might be the common shelter of
Greece should the barbarian renew his incursions; but it is so obvious
that Themistocles could hardly disclose to Sparta the very project he
at first concealed from the Athenians, that while we may allow the
fact that Themistocles treated with the Spartans, we must give him
credit, at least, for more crafty diplomacy than that ascribed to him
by Diodorus <a href="#note-128" name="noteref-128"><small>128</small></a>.  But whatever the pretexts with which he sought to
amuse or beguile the Spartan government, they appear at least to have
been successful.  And the customary indifference of the Spartans
towards maritime affairs was strengthened at this peculiar time by
engrossing anxieties as to the conduct of Pausanias.  Thus
Themistocles, safe alike from foreign and from civil obstacles,
pursued with activity the execution of his schemes.  The Piraeus was
fortified by walls of amazing thickness, so as to admit two carts
abreast.  Within, the entire structure was composed of solid masonry,
hewn square, so that each stone fitted exactly, and was further
strengthened on the outside by cramps of iron.  The walls were never
carried above half the height originally proposed.  But the whole was
so arranged as to form a fortress against assault, too fondly deemed
impregnable, and to be adequately manned by the smallest possible
number of citizens; so that the main force might, in time of danger,
be spared to the fleet.
</p>
<p>
Thus Themistocles created a sea-fortress more important than the city
itself, conformably to the advice he frequently gave to the Athenians,
that, if hard pressed by land, they should retire to this arsenal, and
rely, against all hostilities, on their naval force. <a href="#note-129" name="noteref-129"><small>129</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The new port, which soon bore the ambitious title of the Lower City,
was placed under the directions of Hippodamus, a Milesian, who,
according to Aristotle <a href="#note-130" name="noteref-130"><small>130</small></a>, was the first author who, without any
knowledge of practical affairs, wrote upon the theory of government.
Temples <a href="#note-131" name="noteref-131"><small>131</small></a>, a market-place, even a theatre, distinguished and
enriched the new town.  And the population that filled it were not
long before they contracted and established a character for themselves
different in many traits and attributes from the citizens of the
ancient Athens&mdash;more bold, wayward, innovating, and tumultuous.
</p>
<p>
But if Sparta deemed it prudent, at present, to avoid a direct
assumption of influence over Athens, her scheming councils were no
less bent, though by indirect and plausible means, to the extension of
her own power.  To use the simile applied to one of her own chiefs,
where the lion's skin fell short, she sought to eke it by the fox's.
</p>
<p>
At the assembly of the Amphictyons, the Lacedaemonian delegates moved
that all those states who had not joined in the anti-Persic
confederacy should be expelled the council.  Under this popular and
patriotic proposition was sagaciously concealed the increase of the
Spartan authority; for had the Thessalians, Argives, and Thebans
(voices ever counter to the Lacedaemonians) been expelled the
assembly, the Lacedaemonian party would have secured the preponderance
of votes, and the absolute dictation of that ancient council. <a href="#note-132" name="noteref-132"><small>132</small></a>
</p>
<p>
But Themistocles, who seemed endowed with a Spartan sagacity for the
foiling the Spartan interests, resisted the proposition by arguments
no less popular.  He represented to the delegates that it was unjust
to punish states for the errors of their leaders&mdash;that only thirty-one
cities had contributed to the burden of the war, and many of those
inconsiderable&mdash;that it was equally dangerous and absurd to exclude
from the general Grecian councils the great proportion of the Grecian
states.
</p>
<p>
The arguments of Themistocles prevailed, but his success stimulated
yet more sharply against him the rancour of the Lacedaemonians; and,
unable to resist him abroad, they thenceforth resolved to undermine
his authority at home.
</p>
<p>
XI.  While, his danger invisible, Themistocles was increasing with his
own power that of the state, the allies were bent on new enterprises
and continued retribution.  From Persia, now humbled and exhausted, it
was the moment to wrest the Grecian towns, whether in Europe or in
Asia, over which she yet arrogated dominion&mdash;it was resolved,
therefore, to fit out a fleet, to which the Peloponnesus contributed
twenty and Athens thirty vessels.  Aristides presided over the latter;
Pausanias was commander-in-chief; many other of the allies joined the
expedition.  They sailed to Cyprus, and reduced with ease most of the
towns in that island.  Thence proceeding to Byzantium, the main
strength and citadel of Persia upon those coasts, and the link between
her European and Asiatic dominions, they blockaded the town and
ultimately carried it.
</p>
<p>
But these foreign events, however important in themselves, were
trifling in comparison with a revolution which accompanied them, and
which, in suddenly raising Athens to the supreme command of allied
Greece, may be regarded at once as the author of the coming greatness
&mdash;and the subsequent reverses&mdash;of that republic.
</p>
<p>
XII.  The habits of Sparta&mdash;austere, stern, unsocial&mdash;rendered her
ever more effectual in awing foes than conciliating allies; and the
manners of the soldiery were at this time not in any way redeemed or
counterbalanced by those of the chief.  Since the battle of Plataea a
remarkable change was apparent in Pausanias.  Glory had made him
arrogant, and sudden luxury ostentatious.  He had graven on the golden
tripod, dedicated by the confederates to the Delphic god, an
inscription, claiming exclusively to himself, as the general of the
Grecian army, the conquest of the barbarians&mdash;an egotism no less at
variance with the sober pride of Sparta, than it was offensive to the
just vanity of the allies.  The inscription was afterward erased by
the Spartan government, and another, citing only the names of the
confederate cities, and silent as to that of Pausanias, was
substituted in its place.
</p>
<p>
XIII.  To a man of this arrogance, and of a grasping and already
successful ambition, circumstances now presented great and
irresistible temptation.  Though leader of the Grecian armies, he was
but the uncle and proxy of the young Spartan king&mdash;the time must come
when his authority would cease, and the conqueror of the superb
Mardonius sink into the narrow and severe confines of a Spartan
citizen.  Possessed of great talents and many eminent qualities, they
but served the more to discontent him with the limits of their
legitimate sphere and sterility of the Spartan life.  And this
discontent, operating on a temper naturally haughty, evinced itself in
a manner rude, overbearing, and imperious, which the spirit of his
confederates was ill calculated to suffer or forgive.
</p>
<p>
But we can scarcely agree with the ancient historians in attributing
the ascendency of the Athenians alone, or even chiefly, to the conduct
of Pausanias.  The present expedition was naval, and the greater part
of the confederates at Byzantium were maritime powers.  The superior
fleet and the recent naval glories of the Athenians could not fail to
give them, at this juncture, a moral pre-eminence over the other
allies; and we shall observe that the Ionians, and those who had
lately recovered their freedom from the Persian yoke <a href="#note-133" name="noteref-133"><small>133</small></a>, were
especially desirous to exchange the Spartan for the Athenian command.
Connected with the Athenians by origin&mdash;by maritime habits&mdash;by a
kindred suavity and grace of temperament&mdash;by the constant zeal of the
Athenians for their liberties (which made, indeed, the first cause of
the Persian war)&mdash;it was natural that the Ionian Greeks should prefer
the standard of Athens to that of a Doric state; and the proposition
of the Spartans (baffled by the Athenian councils) to yield up the
Ionic settlements to the barbarians, could not but bequeath a lasting
resentment to those proud and polished colonies.
</p>
<p>
XIV.  Aware of the offence he had given, and disgusted himself alike
with his allies and his country, the Spartan chief became driven by
nature and necessity to a dramatic situation, which a future Schiller
may perhaps render yet more interesting than the treason of the
gorgeous Wallenstein, to whose character that of Pausanias has been
indirectly likened <a href="#note-134" name="noteref-134"><small>134</small></a>.  The capture of Byzantium brought the
Spartan regent into contact with many captured and noble Persians
<a href="#note-135" name="noteref-135"><small>135</small></a>, among whom were some related to Xerxes himself.  With these
conversing, new and dazzling views were opened to his ambition.  He
could not but recall the example of Demaratus, whose exile from the
barren dignities of Sparta had procured him the luxuries and the
splendour of oriental pomp, with the delegated authority of three of
the fairest cities of Aeolia.  Greater in renown than Demaratus, he
was necessarily more aspiring in his views.  Accordingly, he privately
released his more exalted prisoners, pretending they had escaped, and
finally explained whatever messages he had intrusted by them to
Xerxes, in a letter to the king, confided to an Eretrian named
Gongylus, who was versed in the language and the manners of Persia,
and to whom he had already deputed the government of Byzantium.  In
this letter Pausanias offered to assist the king in reducing Sparta
and the rest of Greece to the Persian yoke, demanding, in recompense,
the hand of the king's daughter, with an adequate dowry of possessions
and of power.
</p>
<p>
XV.  The time had passed when a Persian monarch could deride the
loftiness of a Spartan's pretensions&mdash;Xerxes received the
communications with delight, and despatched Artabazus to succeed
Megabates in Phrygia, and to concert with the Spartan upon the means
whereby to execute their joint design <a href="#note-136" name="noteref-136"><small>136</small></a>.  But while Pausanias was
in the full flush of his dazzled and grasping hopes, his fall was at
hand.  Occupied with his new projects, his natural haughtiness
increased daily.  He never accosted the officers of the allies but
with abrupt and overbearing insolence; he insulted the military pride
by sentencing many of the soldiers to corporeal chastisement, or to
stand all day with an iron anchor on their shoulders <a href="#note-137" name="noteref-137"><small>137</small></a>.  He
permitted none to seek water, forage, or litter, until the Spartans
were first supplied&mdash;those who attempted it were driven away by rods.
Even Aristides, seeking to remonstrate, was repulsed rudely.  "I am
not at leisure," said the Spartan, with a frown. <a href="#note-138" name="noteref-138"><small>138</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Complaints of this treatment were despatched to Sparta, and in the
mean while the confederates, especially the officers of Chios, Samos,
and Lesbos, pressed Aristides to take on himself the general command,
and protect them from the Spartan's insolence.  The Athenian artfully
replied, that he saw the necessity of the proposition, but that it
ought first to be authorized by some action which would render it
impossible to recede from the new arrangement once formed.
</p>
<p>
The hint was fiercely taken; and a Samian and a Chian officer,
resolving to push matters to the extreme, openly and boldly attacked
the galley of Pausanias himself at the head of the fleet.
Disregarding his angry menaces, now impotent, this assault was
immediately followed up by a public transfer of allegiance; and the
aggressors, quitting the Spartan, arrayed themselves under the
Athenian, banners.  Whatever might have been the consequences of this
insurrection were prevented by the sudden recall of Pausanias.  The
accusations against him had met a ready hearing in Sparta, and that
watchful government had already received intimation of his intrigues
with the Mede.  On his arrival in Sparta, Pausanias was immediately
summoned to trial, convicted in a fine for individual and private
misdemeanours, but acquitted of the principal charge of treason with
the Persians&mdash;not so much from the deficiency as from the abundance of
proof <a href="#note-139" name="noteref-139"><small>139</small></a>; and it was probably prudent to avoid, if possible, the
scandal which the conviction of the general might bring upon the
nation.
</p>
<p>
The Spartans sent Dorcis, with some colleagues, to replace Pausanias
in the command; but the allies were already too disgusted with the
yoke of that nation to concede it.  And the Athenian ascendency was
hourly confirmed by the talents, the bearing, and the affable and
gracious manners of Aristides.  With him was joined an associate of
high hereditary name and strong natural abilities, whose character it
will shortly become necessary to place in detail before the reader.
This comate was no less a person than Cimon, the son of the great
Miltiades.
</p>
<p>
XVI.  Dorcis, finding his pretensions successfully rebutted, returned
home; and the Spartans, never prone to foreign enterprise, anxious for
excuses to free themselves from prosecuting further the Persian war,
and fearful that renewed contentions might only render yet more
unpopular the Spartan name, sent forth no fresh claimants to the
command; they affected to yield that honour, with cheerful content, to
the Athenians.  Thus was effected without a blow, and with the
concurrence of her most dreaded rival, that eventful revolution, which
suddenly raised Athens, so secondary a state before the Persian war,
to the supremacy over Greece.  So much, when nations have an equal
glory, can the one be brought to surpass the other (B. C. 477) by the
superior wisdom of individuals.  The victory of Plataea was won
principally by Sparta, then at the head of Greece.  And the general
who subdued the Persians surrendered the results of his victory to the
very ally from whom the sagacious jealousy of his countrymen had
sought most carefully to exclude even the precautions of defence!
</p>
<p>
XVII.  Aristides, now invested with the command of all the allies,
save those of the Peloponnesus who had returned home, strengthened the
Athenian power by every semblance of moderation.
</p>
<p>
Hitherto the Grecian confederates had sent their deputies to the
Peloponnesus.  Aristides, instead of naming Athens, which might have
excited new jealousies, proposed the sacred Isle of Delos, a spot
peculiarly appropriate, since it once had been the navel of the Ionian
commerce, as the place of convocation and the common treasury: the
temple was to be the senate house.  A new distribution of the taxes
levied on each state, for the maintenance of the league, was ordained.
The objects of the league were both defensive and offensive; first, to
guard the Aegaean coasts and the Grecian Isles; and, secondly, to
undertake measures for the further weakening of the Persian power.
Aristides was elected arbitrator in the relative proportions of the
general taxation.  In this office, which placed the treasures of
Greece at his disposal, he acted with so disinterested a virtue, that
he did not even incur the suspicion of having enriched himself, and
with so rare a fortune that he contented all the allies.  The total,
raised annually, and with the strictest impartiality, was four hundred
and sixty talents (computed at about one hundred and fifteen thousand
pounds).
</p>
<p>
Greece resounded with the praises of Aristides; it was afterward
equally loud in reprobation of the avarice of the Athenians.  For with
the appointment of Aristides commenced the institution of officers
styled Hellenotamiae, or treasurers of Greece; they became a permanent
magistracy&mdash;they were under the control of the Athenians; and thus
that people were made at once the generals and the treasurers of
Greece.  But the Athenians, unconscious as yet of the power they had
attained&mdash;their allies yet more blind&mdash;it seemed now, that the more
the latter should confide, the more the former should forbear.  So do
the most important results arise from causes uncontemplated by the
providence of statesmen, and hence do we learn a truth which should
never be forgotten&mdash;that that power is ever the most certain of
endurance and extent, the commencement of which is made popular by
moderation.
</p>
<p>
XVIII.  Thus, upon the decay of the Isthmian Congress, rose into
existence the great Ionian league; and thus was opened to the ambition
of Athens the splendid destiny of the empire of the Grecian seas.  The
pre-eminence of Sparta passed away from her, though invisibly and
without a struggle, and, retiring within herself, she was probably
unaware of the decline of her authority; still seeing her
Peloponnesian allies gathering round her, subordinate and submissive,
and, by refusing assistance, refusing also allegiance to the new queen
of the Ionian league.  His task fulfilled, Aristides probably returned
to Athens, and it was at this time and henceforth that it became his
policy to support the power of Cimon against the authority of
Themistocles <a href="#note-140" name="noteref-140"><small>140</small></a>.  To that eupatrid, joined before with himself, was
now intrusted the command of the Grecian fleet.
</p>
<p>
To great natural abilities, Cimon added every advantage of birth and
circumstance.  His mother was a daughter of Olorus, a Thracian prince;
his father the great Miltiades.  On the death of the latter, it is
recorded, and popularly believed, that Cimon, unable to pay the fine
to which Miltiades was adjudged, was detained in custody until a
wealthy marriage made by his sister Elpinice, to whom he was tenderly,
and ancient scandal whispered improperly, attached, released him from
confinement, and the brother-in-law paid the debt.  "Thus severe and
harsh," says Nepos, "was his entrance upon manhood." <a href="#note-141" name="noteref-141"><small>141</small></a>  But it is
very doubtful whether Cimon was ever imprisoned for the state-debt
incurred by his father&mdash;and his wealth appears to have been
considerable even before he regained his patrimony in the Chersonese,
or enriched himself with the Persian spoils. <a href="#note-142" name="noteref-142"><small>142</small></a>
</p>
<p>
In early youth, like Themistocles, his conduct had been wild and
dissolute <a href="#note-143" name="noteref-143"><small>143</small></a>; and with his father from a child, he had acquired,
with the experience, something of the license, of camps.  Like
Themistocles also, he was little skilled in the graceful
accomplishments of his countrymen; he cultivated neither the art of
music, nor the brilliancies of Attic conversation; but power and
fortune, which ever soften nature, afterward rendered his habits
intellectual and his tastes refined.  He had not the smooth and artful
affability of Themistocles, but to a certain roughness of manner was
conjoined that hearty and ingenuous frankness which ever conciliates
mankind, especially in free states, and which is yet more popular when
united to rank.  He had distinguished himself highly by his zeal in
the invasion of the Medes, and the desertion of Athens for Salamis;
and his valour in the seafight had confirmed the promise of his
previous ardour.  Nature had gifted him with a handsome countenance
and a majestic stature, recommendations in all, but especially in
popular states&mdash;and the son of Miltiades was welcomed, not less by the
people than by the nobles, when he applied for a share in the
administration of the state.  Associated with Aristides, first in the
embassy to Sparta, and subsequently in the expeditions to Cyprus and
Byzantium, he had profited by the friendship and the lessons of that
great man, to whose party he belonged, and who saw in Cimon a less
invidious opponent than himself to the policy or the ambition of
Themistocles.
</p>
<p>
By the advice of Aristides, Cimon early sought every means to
conciliate the allies, and to pave the way to the undivided command he
afterward obtained.  And it is not improbable that Themistocles might
willingly have ceded to him the lead in a foreign expedition, which
removed from the city so rising and active an opponent.  The
appointment of Cimon promised to propitiate the Spartans, who ever
possessed a certain party in the aristocracy of Athens&mdash;who peculiarly
affected Cimon, and whose hardy character and oligarchical policy the
blunt genius and hereditary prejudices of that young noble were well
fitted to admire and to imitate.  Cimon was, in a word, precisely the
man desired by three parties as the antagonist of Themistocles; viz.,
the Spartans, the nobles, and Aristides, himself a host.  All things
conspired to raise the son of Miltiades to an eminence beyond his
years, but not his capacities.
</p>
<p>
XIX.  Under Cimon the Athenians commenced their command <a href="#note-144" name="noteref-144"><small>144</small></a>, by
marching against a Thracian town called Eion, situated on the banks of
the river Strymon, and now garrisoned by a Persian noble.  The town
was besieged (B. C. 476), and the inhabitants pressed by famine, when
the Persian commandant, collecting his treasure upon a pile of wood,
on which were placed his slaves, women, and children&mdash;set fire to the
pile <a href="#note-145" name="noteref-145"><small>145</small></a>.  After this suicide, seemingly not an uncommon mode of
self-slaughter in the East, the garrison surrendered, and its
defenders, as usual in such warfare, were sold for slaves.
</p>
<p>
From Eion the victorious confederates proceeded to Scyros, a small
island in the Aegean, inhabited by the Dolopians, a tribe addicted to
piratical practices, deservedly obnoxious to the traders of the
Aegean, and who already had attracted the indignation and vengeance of
the Amphictyonic assembly.  The isle occupied, and the pirates
expelled, the territory was colonized by an Attic population.
</p>
<p>
An ancient tradition had, as we have seen before, honoured the soil of
Scyros with the possession of the bones of the Athenian Theseus&mdash;some
years after the conquest of the isle, in the archonship of Aphepsion
<a href="#note-146" name="noteref-146"><small>146</small></a>, or Apsephion, an oracle ordained the Athenians to search for
the remains of their national hero, and the skeleton of a man of great
stature, with a lance of brass and a sword by its side was discovered,
and immediately appropriated to Theseus.  The bones were placed with
great ceremony in the galley of Cimon, who was then probably on a
visit of inspection to the new colony, and transported to Athens.
Games were instituted in honour of this event, at which were exhibited
the contests of the tragic poets; and, in the first of these,
Sophocles is said to have made his earliest appearance, and gained the
prize from Aeschylus (B. C. 469).
</p>
<p>
XXI.  It is about the period of Cimon's conquest of Eion and Scyros
(B. C. 476) that we must date the declining power of Themistocles.
That remarkable man had already added, both to domestic and to Spartan
enmities, the general displeasure of the allies.  After baffling the
proposition of the Spartans to banish from the Amphictyonic assembly
the states that had not joined in the anti-Persic confederacy, he had
sailed round the isles and extorted money from such as had been guilty
of Medising: the pretext might be just, but the exactions were
unpopularly levied.  Nor is it improbable that the accusations against
him of enriching his own coffers as well as the public treasury had
some foundation.  Profoundly disdaining money save as a means to an
end, he was little scrupulous as to the sources whence he sustained a
power which he yet applied conscientiously to patriotic purposes.
Serving his country first, he also served himself; and honest upon one
grand and systematic principle, he was often dishonest in details.
</p>
<p>
His natural temper was also ostentatious; like many who have risen
from an origin comparatively humble, he had the vanity to seek to
outshine his superiors in birth&mdash;not more by the splendour of genius
than by the magnificence of parade.  At the Olympic games, the
base-born son of Neocles surpassed the pomp of the wealthy and
illustrious Cimon; his table was hospitable, and his own life soft and
luxuriant <a href="#note-147" name="noteref-147"><small>147</small></a>; his retinue numerous beyond those of his
contemporaries; and he adopted the manners of the noble exactly in
proportion as he courted the favour of the populace.  This habitual
ostentation could not fail to mingle with the political hostilities of
the aristocracy the disdainful jealousies of offended pride; for it is
ever the weakness of the high-born to forgive less easily the being
excelled in genius than the being outshone in state by those of inferior
origin.  The same haughtiness which offended the nobles began also to
displease the people; the superb consciousness of his own merits wounded
the vanity of a nation which scarcely permitted its greatest men to
share the reputation it arrogated to itself.  The frequent calumnies
uttered against him obliged Themistocles to refer to the actions he had
performed; and what it had been illustrious to execute, it became
disgustful to repeat.  "Are you weary," said the great man, bitterly,
"to receive benefits often from the same hand?" <a href="#note-148" name="noteref-148"><small>148</small></a>  He offended the
national conceit yet more by building, in the neighbourhood of his own
residence, a temple to Diana, under the name of Aristobule, or "Diana of
the best counsel;" thereby appearing to claim to himself the merit of
giving the best counsels.
</p>
<p>
It is probable, however, that Themistocles would have conquered all
party opposition, and that his high qualities would have more than
counterbalanced his defects in the eyes of the people, if he had still
continued to lead the popular tide.  But the time had come when the
demagogue was outbid by an aristocrat&mdash;when the movement he no longer
headed left him behind, and the genius of an individual could no
longer keep pace with the giant strides of an advancing people.
</p>
<p>
XXII.  The victory at Salamis was followed by a democratic result.
That victory had been obtained by the seamen, who were mostly of the
lowest of the populace&mdash;the lowest of the populace began, therefore,
to claim, in political equality, the reward of military service.  And
Aristotle, whose penetrating intellect could not fail to notice the
changes which an event so glorious to Greece produced in Athens, has
adduced a similar instance of change at Syracuse, when the mariners of
that state, having, at a later period, conquered the Athenians,
converted a mixed republic to a pure democracy.  The destruction of
houses and property by Mardonius&mdash;the temporary desertion by the
Athenians of their native land&mdash;the common danger and the common
glory, had broken down many of the old distinctions, and the spirit of
the nation was already far more democratic than the constitution.
Hitherto, qualifications of property were demanded for the holding of
civil offices.  But after the battle of Plataea, Aristides, the leader
of the aristocratic party, proposed and carried the abolition of such
qualifications, allowing to all citizens, with or without property, a
share in the government, and ordaining that the archons should be
chosen out of the whole body; the form of investigation as to moral
character was still indispensable.  This change, great as it was,
appears, like all aristocratic reforms, to have been a compromise
<a href="#note-149" name="noteref-149"><small>149</small></a> between concession and demand.  And the prudent Aristides
yielded what was inevitable, to prevent the greater danger of
resistance.  It may be ever remarked, that the people value more a
concession from the aristocratic party than a boon from their own
popular leaders.  The last can never equal, and the first can so
easily exceed, the public expectation.
</p>
<p>
XXIII.  This decree, uniting the aristocratic with the more democratic
party, gave Aristides and his friends an unequivocal ascendency over
Themistocles, which, however, during the absence of Aristides and
Cimon, and the engrossing excitement of events abroad, was not plainly
visible for some years; and although, on his return to Athens,
Aristides himself prudently forbore taking an active part against his
ancient rival, he yet lent all the influence of his name and
friendship to the now powerful and popular Cimon.  The victories, the
manners, the wealth, the birth of the son of Miltiades were supported
by his talents and his ambition.  It was obvious to himself and to his
party that, were Themistocles removed, Cimon would become the first
citizen of Athens.
</p>
<p>
XXIV.  Such were the causes that long secretly undermined, that at
length openly stormed, the authority of the hero of Salamis; and at
this juncture we may conclude, that the vices of his character avenged
themselves on the virtues.  His duplicity and spirit of intrigue,
exercised on behalf of his country, it might be supposed, would
hereafter be excited against it.  And the pride, the ambition, the
craft that had saved the people might serve to create a despot.
</p>
<p>
Themistocles was summoned to the ordeal of the ostracism and condemned
by the majority of suffrages (B. C. 471).  Thus, like Aristides, not
punished for offences, but paying the honourable penalty of rising by
genius to that state of eminence which threatens danger to the
equality of republics.
</p>
<p>
He departed from Athens, and chose his refuge at Argos, whose hatred
to Sparta, his deadliest foe, promised him the securest protection.
</p>
<p>
XXV.  Death soon afterward removed Aristides from all competitorship
with Cimon; according to the most probable accounts, he died at
Athens; and at the time of Plutarch his monument was still to be seen
at Phalerum.  His countrymen, who, despite all plausible charges, were
never ungrateful except where their liberties appeared imperilled
(whether rightly or erroneously our documents are too scanty to
prove), erected his monument at the public charge, portioned his three
daughters, and awarded to his son Lysimachus a grant of one hundred
minae of silver, a plantation of one hundred plethra <a href="#note-150" name="noteref-150"><small>150</small></a> of land,
and a pension of four drachmae a day (double the allowance of an
Athenian ambassador).

Popularity and Policy of Cimon.&mdash;Naxos revolts from the Ionian
League.&mdash;Is besieged by Cimon.&mdash;Conspiracy and Fate of Pausanias.&mdash;
Flight and Adventures of Themistocles.&mdash;His Death.
</p>
<p>
I.  The military abilities and early habits of Cimon naturally
conspired with past success to direct his ambition rather to warlike
than to civil distinctions.  But he was not inattentive to the arts
which were necessary in a democratic state to secure and confirm his
power.  Succeeding to one, once so beloved and ever so affable as
Themistocles, he sought carefully to prevent all disadvantageous
contrast.  From the spoils of Byzantium and Sestos he received a vast
addition to his hereditary fortunes.  And by the distribution of his
treasures, he forestalled all envy at their amount.  He threw open his
gardens to the public, whether foreigners or citizens&mdash;he maintained a
table to which men of every rank freely resorted, though probably
those only of his own tribe <a href="#note-151" name="noteref-151"><small>151</small></a>&mdash;he was attended by a numerous
train, who were ordered to give mantles to what citizen soever&mdash;aged
and ill-clad&mdash;they encountered; and to relieve the necessitous by aims
delicately and secretly administered.  By these artful devices he
rendered himself beloved, and concealed the odium of his politics
beneath the mask of his charities.  For while he courted the favour,
he advanced not the wishes, of the people.  He sided with the
aristocratic party, and did not conceal his attachment to the
oligarchy of Sparta.  He sought to content the people with himself, in
order that he might the better prevent discontent with their position.
But it may be doubted whether Cimon did not, far more than any of his
predecessors, increase the dangers of a democracy by vulgarizing its
spirit.  The system of general alms and open tables had the effect
that the abuses of the Poor Laws <a href="#note-152" name="noteref-152"><small>152</small></a> have had with us.  It
accustomed the native poor to the habits of indolent paupers, and what
at first was charity soon took the aspect of a right.  Hence much of
the lazy turbulence, and much of that licentious spirit of exaction
from the wealthy, that in a succeeding age characterized the mobs of
Athens.  So does that servile generosity, common to an anti-popular
party, when it affects kindness in order to prevent concession,
ultimately operate against its own secret schemes.  And so much less
really dangerous is it to exalt, by constitutional enactments, the
authority of a people, than to pamper, by the electioneering
cajoleries of a selfish ambition, the prejudices which thus settle
into vices, or the momentary exigences thus fixed into permanent
demands.
</p>
<p>
II.  While the arts or manners of Cimon conciliated the favour, his
integrity won the esteem, of the people.  In Aristides he found the
example, not more of his aristocratic politics than of his lofty
honour.  A deserter from Persia, having arrived at Athens with great
treasure, and being harassed by informers, sought the protection of
Cimon by gifts of money.
</p>
<p>
"Would you have me," said the Athenian, smiling, "your mercenary or
your friend?"
</p>
<p>
"My friend!" replied the barbarian.
</p>
<p>
"Then take back your gifts." <a href="#note-153" name="noteref-153"><small>153</small></a>
</p>
<p>
III.  In the mean while the new ascendency of Athens was already
endangered.  The Carystians in the neighbouring isle of Euboea openly
defied her fleet, and many of the confederate states, seeing
themselves delivered from all immediate dread of another invasion of
the Medes, began to cease contributions both to the Athenian navy and
the common treasury.  For a danger not imminent, service became
burdensome and taxation odious.  And already some well-founded
jealousy of the ambition of Athens increased the reluctance to augment
her power.  Naxos was the first island that revolted from the
conditions of the league, and thither Cimon, having reduced the
Carystians, led a fleet numerous and well equipped.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the secret views of Cimon for the aggrandizement of his
country, he could not but feel himself impelled by his own genius and
the popular expectation not lightly to forego that empire of the sea,
rendered to Athens by the profound policy of Themistocles and the
fortunate prudence of Aristides; and every motive of Grecian, as well
as Athenian, policy justified the subjugation of the revolters&mdash;an
evident truth in the science of state policy, but one somewhat hastily
lost sight of by those historians who, in the subsequent and
unlooked-for results, forgot the necessity of the earlier enterprise.
Greece had voluntarily intrusted to Athens the maritime command of the
confederate states.  To her, Greece must consequently look for no
diminution of the national resources committed to her charge; to her,
that the conditions of the league were fulfilled, and the common
safety of Greece ensured.  Commander of the forces, she was answerable
for the deserters.  Nor, although Persia at present remained tranquil
and inert, could the confederates be considered safe from her revenge.
No compact of peace had been procured.  The more than suspected
intrigues of Xerxes with Pausanias were sufficient proofs that the
great king did not yet despair of the conquest of Greece.  And the
peril previously incurred in the want of union among the several
states was a solemn warning not to lose the advantages of that league,
so tardily and so laboriously cemented.  Without great dishonour and
without great imprudence, Athens could not forego the control with
which she had been invested; if it were hers to provide the means, it
was hers to punish the defaulters; and her duty to Greece thus
decorously and justly sustained her ambition for herself.
</p>
<p>
IV.  And now it is necessary to return to the fortunes of Pausanias,
involving in their fall the ruin of one of far loftier virtues and
more unequivocal renown.  The recall of Pausanias, the fine inflicted
upon him, his narrow escape from a heavier sentence, did not suffice
to draw him, intoxicated as he was with his hopes and passions, from
his bold and perilous intrigues.  It is not improbable that his mind
was already tainted with a certain insanity <a href="#note-154" name="noteref-154"><small>154</small></a>.  And it is a
curious physiological fact, that the unnatural constraints of Sparta,
when acting on strong passions and fervent imaginations, seem, not
unoften, to have produced a species of madness.  An anecdote is
recorded <a href="#note-155" name="noteref-155"><small>155</small></a>, which, though romantic, is not perhaps wholly
fabulous, and which invests with an interest yet more dramatic the
fate of the conqueror of Plataea.
</p>
<p>
At Byzantium, runs the story, he became passionately enamoured of a
young virgin named Cleonice.  Awed by his power and his sternness, the
parents yielded her to his will.  The modesty of the maiden made her
stipulate that the room might be in total darkness when she stole to
his embraces.  But unhappily, on entering, she stumbled against the
light, and the Spartan, asleep at the time, imagined, in the confusion
of his sudden waking, that the noise was occasioned by one of his
numerous enemies seeking his chamber with the intent to assassinate
him.  Seizing the Persian cimeter <a href="#note-156" name="noteref-156"><small>156</small></a> that lay beside him, he
plunged it in the breast of the intruder, and the object of his
passion fell dead at his feet.  "From that hour," says the biographer,
"he could rest no more!"  A spectre haunted his nights&mdash;the voice of
the murdered girl proclaimed doom to his ear.  It is added, and, if we
extend our belief further, we must attribute the apparition to the
skill of the priests, that, still tortured by the ghost of Cleonice,
he applied to those celebrated necromancers who, at Heraclea <a href="#note-157" name="noteref-157"><small>157</small></a>,
summoned by gloomy spells the manes of the dead, and by their aid
invoked the spirit he sought to appease.  The shade of Cleonice
appeared and told him, "that soon after his return to Sparta he would
be delivered from all his troubles." <a href="#note-158" name="noteref-158"><small>158</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Such was the legend repeated, as Plutarch tells us, by many
historians; the deed itself was probable, and conscience, even without
necromancy, might supply the spectre.
</p>
<p>
V.  Whether or not this story have any foundation in fact, the conduct
of Pausanias seems at least to have partaken of that inconsiderate
recklessness which, in the ancient superstition, preceded the
vengeance of the gods.  After his trial he had returned to Byzantium,
without the consent of the Spartan government.  Driven thence by the
resentment of the Athenians <a href="#note-159" name="noteref-159"><small>159</small></a>, he repaired, not to Sparta, but to
Colonae, in Asia Minor, and in the vicinity of the ancient Troy; and
there he renewed his negotiations with the Persian king.  Acquainted
with his designs, the vigilant ephors despatched to him a herald with
the famous scytale.  This was an instrument peculiar to the Spartans.
To every general or admiral, a long black staff was entrusted; the
magistrates kept another exactly similar.  When they had any
communication to make, they wrote it on a roll of parchment, applied
it to their own staff, fold upon fold&mdash;then cutting it off, dismissed
it to the chief.  The characters were so written that they were
confused and unintelligible until fastened to the stick, and thus
could only be construed by the person for whose eye they were
intended, and to whose care the staff was confided.
</p>
<p>
The communication Pausanias now received was indeed stern and laconic.
"Stay," it said, "behind the herald, and war is proclaimed against you
by the Spartans."
</p>
<p>
On receiving this solemn order, even the imperious spirit of Pausanias
did not venture to disobey.  Like Venice, whose harsh, tortuous, but
energetic policy her oligarchy in so many respects resembled, Sparta
possessed a moral and mysterious power over the fiercest of her sons.
His fate held him in her grasp, and, confident of acquittal, instead
of flying to Persia, the regent hurried to his doom, assured that by
the help of gold he could baffle any accusation.  His expectations
were so far well-founded, that, although, despite his rank as regent
of the kingdom and guardian of the king, he was thrown into prison by
the ephors, he succeeded, by his intrigues and influence, in procuring
his enlargement: and boldly challenging his accusers, he offered to
submit to trial.
</p>
<p>
The government, however, was slow to act.  The proud caution of the
Spartans was ever loath to bring scandal on their home by public
proceedings against any freeborn citizen&mdash;how much more against the
uncle of their monarch and the hero of their armies!  His power, his
talents, his imperious character awed alike private enmity and public
distrust.  But his haughty disdain of their rigid laws, and his
continued affectation of the barbarian pomp, kept the government
vigilant; and though released from prison, the stern ephors were his
sentinels.  The restless and discontented mind of the expectant
son-in-law of Xerxes could not relinquish its daring schemes.  And the
regent of Sparta entered into a conspiracy, on which it were much to
be desired that our information were more diffuse.
</p>
<p>
VI.  Perhaps no class of men in ancient times excite a more painful
and profound interest than the helots of Sparta.  Though, as we have
before seen, we must reject all rhetorical exaggerations of the savage
cruelty to which they were subjected, we know, at least, that their
servitude was the hardest imposed by any of the Grecian states upon
their slaves <a href="#note-160" name="noteref-160"><small>160</small></a>, and that the iron soldiery of Sparta were exposed
to constant and imminent peril from their revolts&mdash;a proof that the
curse of their bondage had passed beyond the degree which subdues the
spirit to that which arouses, and that neither the habit of years, nor
the swords of the fiercest warriors, nor the spies of the keenest
government of Greece had been able utterly to extirpate from human
hearts that law of nature which, when injury passes an allotted, yet
rarely visible, extreme, converts suffering to resistance.
</p>
<p>
Scattered in large numbers throughout the rugged territories of
Laconia&mdash;separated from the presence, but not the watch, of their
master, these singular serfs never abandoned the hope of liberty.
Often pressed into battle to aid their masters, they acquired the
courage to oppose them.  Fierce, sullen, and vindictive, they were as
droves of wild cattle, left to range at will, till wanted for the
burden or the knife&mdash;not difficult to butcher, but impossible to tame.
</p>
<p>
We have seen that a considerable number of these helots had fought as
light-armed troops at Plataea; and the common danger and the common
glory had united the slaves of the army with the chief.  Entering into
somewhat of the desperate and revengeful ambition that, under a
similar constitution, animated Marino Faliero, Pausanias sought, by
means of the enslaved multitude, to deliver himself from the thraldom
of the oligarchy which held prince and slave alike in subjection.  He
tampered with the helots, and secretly promised them the rights and
liberties of citizens of Sparta, if they would co-operate with his
projects and revolt at his command.
</p>
<p>
Slaves are never without traitors; and the ephors learned the
premeditated revolution from helots themselves.  Still, slow and wary,
those subtle and haughty magistrates suspended the blow&mdash;it was not
without the fullest proof that a royal Spartan was to be condemned on
the word of helots: they continued their vigilance&mdash;they obtained the
proof they required.
</p>
<p>
VII.  Argilius, a Spartan, with whom Pausanias had once formed the
vicious connexion common to the Doric tribes, and who was deep in his
confidence, was intrusted by the regent with letters to Artabazus.
Argilius called to mind that none intrusted with a similar mission had
ever returned.  He broke open the seals and read what his fears
foreboded, that, on his arrival at the satrap's court, the silence of
the messenger was to be purchased by his death.  He carried the packet
to the ephors.  That dark and plotting council were resolved yet more
entirely to entangle their guilty victim, and out of his own mouth to
extract his secret; they therefore ordered Argilius to take refuge as
a suppliant in the sanctuary of the temple of Neptune on Mount
Taenarus.  Within the sacred confines was contrived a cell, which, by
a double partition, admitted some of the ephors, who, there concealed,
might witness all that passed.
</p>
<p>
Intelligence was soon brought to Pausanias that, instead of proceeding
to Artabazus, his confidant had taken refuge as a suppliant in the
temple of Neptune.  Alarmed and anxious, the regent hastened to the
sanctuary.  Argilius informed him that he had read the letters, and
reproached him bitterly with his treason to himself.  Pausanias,
confounded and overcome by the perils which surrounded him, confessed
his guilt, spoke unreservedly of the contents of the letter, implored
the pardon of Argilius, and promised him safety and wealth if he would
leave the sanctuary and proceed on the mission.
</p>
<p>
The ephors, from their hiding-place, heard all.
</p>
<p>
On the departure of Pausanias from the sanctuary, his doom was fixed.
But, among the more public causes of the previous delay of justice, we
must include the friendship of some of the ephors, which Pausanias had
won or purchased.  It was the moment fixed for his arrest.  Pausanias,
in the streets, was alone and on foot.  He beheld the ephors
approaching him.  A signal from one warned him of his danger.  He
turned&mdash;he fled.  The temple of Minerva Chalcioecus at hand proffered
a sanctuary&mdash;he gained the sacred confines, and entered a small house
hard by the temple.  The ephors&mdash;the officers&mdash;the crowd pursued; they
surrounded the refuge, from which it was impious to drag the criminal.
Resolved on his death, they removed the roof&mdash;blocked up the entrances
(and if we may credit the anecdote, that violating human was
characteristic of Spartan nature, his mother, a crone of great age
<a href="#note-161" name="noteref-161"><small>161</small></a>, suggested the means of punishment, by placing, with her own
hand, a stone at the threshold)&mdash;and, setting a guard around, left the
conqueror of Mardonius to die of famine.  When he was at his last
gasp, unwilling to profane the sanctuary by his actual death, they
bore him out into the open air, which he only breathed to expire
<a href="#note-162" name="noteref-162"><small>162</small></a>.  His corpse, which some of the fiercer Spartans at first
intended to cast in the place of burial for malefactors, was afterward
buried in the neighbourhood of the temple.  And thus ended the glory
and the crimes&mdash;the grasping ambition and the luxurious ostentation&mdash;
of the bold Spartan who first scorned and then imitated the
effeminacies of the Persian he subdued.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Amid the documents of which the ephors possessed themselves
after the death of Pausanias was a correspondence with Themistocles,
then residing in the rival and inimical state of Argos.  Yet
vindictive against that hero, the Spartan government despatched
ambassadors to Athens, accusing him of a share in the conspiracy of
Pausanias with the Medes.  It seems that Themistocles did not disavow
a correspondence with Pausanias, nor affect an absolute ignorance of
his schemes; but he firmly denied by letter, his only mode of defence,
all approval and all participation of the latter.  Nor is there any
proof, nor any just ground of suspicion, that he was a party to the
betrayal of Greece.  It was consistent, indeed, with his astute
character, to plot, to manoeuvre, to intrigue, but for great and not
paltry ends.  By possessing himself of the secret, he possessed
himself of the power of Pausanias; and that intelligence might perhaps
have enabled him to frustrate the Spartan's treason in the hour of
actual danger to Greece.  It is possible that, so far as Sparta alone
was concerned, the Athenian felt little repugnance to any revolution
or any peril confined to a state whose councils it had been the object
of his life to baffle, and whose power it was the manifest interest of
his native city to impair.  He might have looked with complacency on
the intrigues which the regent was carrying on against the Spartan
government, and which threatened to shake that Doric constitution to
its centre.  But nothing, either in the witness of history or in the
character or conduct of a man profoundly patriotic, even in his vices,
favours the notion that he connived at the schemes which implicated,
with the Grecian, the Athenian welfare.  Pausanias, far less able, was
probably his tool.  By an insight into his projects, Themistocles
might have calculated on the restoration of his own power.  To weaken
the Spartan influence was to weaken his own enemies at Athens; to
break up the Spartan constitution was to leave Athens herself without
a rival.  And if, from the revolt of the helots, Pausanias should
proceed to an active league with the Persians, Themistocles knew
enough of Athens and of Greece to foresee that it was to the victor of
Salamis and the founder of the Grecian navy that all eyes would be
directed.  Such seem the most probable views which would have been
opened to the exile by the communications of Pausanias.  If so, they
were necessarily too subtle for the crowd to penetrate or understand.
The Athenians heard only the accusations of the Spartans; they saw
only the treason of Pausanias; they learned only that Themistocles had
been the correspondent of the traitor.  Already suspicious of a genius
whose deep and intricate wiles they were seldom able to fathom, and
trembling at the seeming danger they had escaped, it was natural
enough that the Athenians should accede to the demands of the
ambassadors.  An Athenian, joined with a Lacedaemonian troop, was
ordered to seize Themistocles wherever he should be found.  Apprized
of his danger, he hastily quitted the Peloponnesus and took refuge at
Corcyra.  Fear of the vengeance at once of Athens and of Sparta
induced the Corcyreans to deny the shelter he sought, but they
honourably transported him to the opposite continent.  His route was
discovered&mdash;his pursuers pressed upon him.  He had entered the country
of Admetus, king of the Molossians, from whose resentment he had
everything to dread.  For he had persuaded the Athenians to reject the
alliance once sought by that monarch, and Admetus had vowed vengeance.
</p>
<p>
Thus situated, the fugitive formed a resolution which a great mind
only could have conceived, and which presents to us one of the most
touching pictures in ancient history.  He repaired to the palace of
Admetus himself.  The prince was absent.  He addressed his consort,
and, advised by her, took the young child of the royal pair in his
hand, and sat down at the hearth&mdash;"THEMISTOCLES THE SUPPLIANT!" <a href="#note-163" name="noteref-163"><small>163</small></a>
On the return of the prince he told his name, and bade him not wreak
his vengeance on an exile.  "To condemn me now," he said, "would be to
take advantage of distress.  Honour dictates revenge only among equals
upon equal terms.  True that I opposed you once, but on a matter not
of life, but of business or of interest.  Now surrender me to my
persecutors, and you deprive me of the last refuge of life itself."
</p>
<p>
IX.  Admetus, much affected, bade him rise, and assured him of
protection.  The pursuers arrived; but, faithful to the guest who had
sought his hearth, after a form peculiarly solemn among the
Molossians, Admetus refused to give him up, and despatched him,
guarded, to the sea-town of Pydna, over an arduous and difficult
mountain-road.  The sea-town gained, he took ship, disguised and
unknown to all the passengers, in a trading vessel bound to Ionia.  A
storm arose&mdash;the vessel was driven from its course, and impelled right
towards the Athenian fleet, that then under Cimon, his bitterest foe,
lay before the Isle of Naxos (B. C. 466).
</p>
<p>
Prompt and bold in his expedients, Themistocles took aside the master
of the vessel&mdash;discovered himself; threatened, if betrayed, to inform
against the master as one bribed to favour his escape; promised, if
preserved, everlasting gratitude; and urged that the preservation was
possible, if no one during the voyage were permitted, on any pretext,
to quit the vessel.
</p>
<p>
The master of the vessel was won&mdash;kept out at sea a day and a night to
windward of the fleet, and landed Themistocles in safety at Ephesus.
</p>
<p>
In the mean while the friends of Themistocles had not been inactive in
Athens.  On the supposed discovery of his treason, such of his
property as could fall into the hands of the government was, as usual
in such offences, confiscated to the public use; the amount was
variously estimated at eighty and a hundred talents <a href="#note-164" name="noteref-164"><small>164</small></a>.  But the
greater part of his wealth&mdash;some from Athens, some from Argos&mdash;was
secretly conveyed to him at Ephesus <a href="#note-165" name="noteref-165"><small>165</small></a>.  One faithful friend
procured the escape of his wife and children from Athens to the court
of Admetus, for which offence of affection, a single historian,
Stesimbrotus (whose statement even the credulous Plutarch questions,
and proves to be contradictory with another assertion of the same
author), has recorded that he was condemned to death by Cimon.  It is
not upon such dubious chronicles that we can suffer so great a stain
on the character of a man singularly humane. <a href="#note-166" name="noteref-166"><small>166</small></a>
</p>
<p>
X.  As we have now for ever lost sight of Themistocles on the stage of
Athenian politics, the present is the most fitting opportunity to
conclude the history of his wild and adventurous career.
</p>
<p>
Persecuted by the Spartans, abandoned by his countrymen, excluded from
the whole of Greece, no refuge remained to the man who had crushed the
power of Persia, save the Persian court.  The generous and
high-spirited policy that characterized the oriental despotism towards
its foes proffered him not only a safe, but a magnificent asylum.  The
Persian monarchs were ever ready to welcome the exiles of Greece, and to
conciliate those whom they had failed to conquer.  It was the fate of
Themistocles to be saved by the enemies of his country.  He had no
alternative.  The very accusation of connivance with the Medes drove him
into their arms.
</p>
<p>
Under guidance of a Persian, Themistocles traversed the Asiatic
continent; and ere he reached Susa, contrived to have a letter, that
might prepare the way for him, delivered at the Persian court.  His
letter ran somewhat thus, if we may suppose that Thucydides preserved
the import, though he undoubtedly fashioned the style. <a href="#note-167" name="noteref-167"><small>167</small></a>
</p>
<p>
"I, Themistocles, who of all the Greeks have inflicted the severest
wounds upon your race, so long as I was called by fate to resist the
invasion of the Persians, now come to you."  (He then urged, on the
other hand, the services he had rendered to Xerxes in his messages
after Salamis, relative to the breaking of the bridges, assuming a
credit to which he was by no means entitled&mdash;and insisted that his
generosity demanded a return.) "Able" (he proceeded) "to perform great
services&mdash;persecuted by the Greeks for my friendship for you&mdash;I am
near at hand.  Grant me only a year's respite, that I may then apprize
you in person of the object of my journey hither."
</p>
<p>
The bold and confident tone of Themistocles struck the imagination of
the young king (Artaxerxes), and he returned a favourable reply.
Themistocles consumed the year in the perfect acquisition of the
language, and the customs and manners of the country.  He then sought
and obtained an audience. <a href="#note-168" name="noteref-168"><small>168</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Able to converse with fluency, and without the medium of an
interpreter, his natural abilities found their level.  He rose to
instant favour.  Never before had a stranger been so honoured.  He was
admitted an easy access to the royal person&mdash;instructed in the
learning of the Magi&mdash;and when he quitted the court it was to take
possession of the government of three cities&mdash;Myus, celebrated for its
provisions; Lampsacus, for its vineyards; and Magnesia, for the
richness of the soil; so that, according to the spirit and phraseology
of oriental taxation, it was not unaptly said that they were awarded
to him for meat, wine, and bread.
</p>
<p>
XI.  Thus affluent and thus honoured, Themistocles passed at Magnesia
the remainder of his days&mdash;the time and method of his death uncertain;
whether cut off by natural disease, or, as is otherwise related <a href="#note-169" name="noteref-169"><small>169</small></a>,
by a fate than which fiction itself could have invented none more
suited to the consummation of his romantic and great career.  It is
said that when afterward Egypt revolted, and that revolt was aided by
the Athenians; when the Grecian navy sailed as far as Cilicia and
Cyprus; and Cimon upheld, without a rival, the new sovereignty of the
seas; when Artaxerxes resolved to oppose the growing power of a state
which, from the defensive, had risen to the offending, power;
Themistocles received a mandate to realize the vague promises he had
given, and to commence his operations against Greece (B. C. 449).
Then (if with Plutarch we accept this version of his fate), neither
resentment against the people he had deemed ungrateful, nor his
present pomp, nor the fear of life, could induce the lord of Magnesia
to dishonour his past achievements <a href="#note-170" name="noteref-170"><small>170</small></a>, and demolish his immortal
trophies.  Anxious only to die worthily&mdash;since to live as became him
was no longer possible&mdash;he solemnly sacrificed to the gods&mdash;took leave
of his friends, and finished his days by poison.
</p>
<p>
His monument long existed in the forum of Magnesia; but his bones are
said by his own desire to have been borne back privately to Attica,
and have rested in the beloved land that exiled him from her bosom.
And this his last request seems touchingly to prove his loyalty to
Athens, and to proclaim his pardon of her persecution.  Certain it is,
at least, that however honoured in Persia, he never perpetrated one
act against Greece; and that, if sullied by the suspicion of others,
his fame was untarnished by himself.  He died, according to Plutarch,
in his sixty-fifth year, leaving many children, and transmitting his
name to a long posterity, who received from his memory the honours
they could not have acquired for themselves.
</p>
<p>
XII.  The character of Themistocles has already in these pages
unfolded itself&mdash;profound, yet tortuous in policy&mdash;vast in conception
&mdash;subtle, patient, yet prompt in action; affable in manner, but
boastful, ostentatious, and disdaining to conceal his consciousness of
merit; not brilliant in accomplishment, yet master not more of the
Greek wiles than the Attic wit; sufficiently eloquent, but greater in
deeds than words, and penetrating, by an almost preternatural insight,
at once the characters of men and the sequences of events.
Incomparably the greatest of his own times, and certainly not
surpassed by those who came after him.  Pisistratus, Cimon, Pericles,
Aristides himself, were of noble and privileged birth.  Themistocles
was the first, and, except Demosthenes, the greatest of those who rose
from the ranks of the people, and he drew the people upward in his
rise.  His fame was the creation of his genius only.  "What other man"
(to paraphrase the unusual eloquence of Diodorus) "could in the same
time have placed Greece at the head of nations, Athens at the head of
Greece, himself at the head of Athens?&mdash;in the most illustrious age
the most illustrious man.  Conducting to war the citizens of a state
in ruins, he defeated all the arms of Asia.  He alone had the power to
unite the most discordant materials, and to render danger itself
salutary to his designs.  Not more remarkable in war than peace&mdash;in
the one he saved the liberties of Greece, in the other he created the
eminence of Athens."
</p>
<p>
After him, the light of the heroic age seems to glimmer and to fade,
and even Pericles himself appears dwarfed and artificial beside that
masculine and colossal intellect which broke into fragments the might
of Persia, and baffled with a vigorous ease the gloomy sagacity of
Sparta.  The statue of Themistocles, existent six hundred years after
his decease, exhibited to his countrymen an aspect as heroical as his
deeds. <a href="#note-171" name="noteref-171"><small>171</small></a>

<p>
We return to Cimon

</p>
<p>
I.  At the time in which Naxos refused the stipulated subsidies, and
was, in consequence, besieged by Cimon, that island was one of the
most wealthy and populous of the confederate states.  For some time
the Naxians gallantly resisted the besiegers; but, at length reduced,
they were subjected to heavier conditions than those previously
imposed upon them.  No conqueror contents himself with acquiring the
objects, sometimes frivolous and often just, with which he commences
hostilities.  War inflames the passions, and success the ambition.
Cimon, at first anxious to secure the Grecian, was now led on to
desire the increase of the Athenian power.  The Athenian fleet had
subdued Naxos, and Naxos was rendered subject to Athens.  This was the
first of the free states which the growing republic submitted to her
yoke <a href="#note-172" name="noteref-172"><small>172</small></a>.  The precedent once set, as occasion tempted, the rest
shared a similar fate.
</p>
<p>
II.  The reduction of Naxos was but the commencement of the victories
of Cimon.  In Asia Minor there were many Grecian cities in which the
Persian ascendency had never yet been shaken.  Along the Carian coast
Cimon conducted his armament, and the terror it inspired sufficed to
engage all the cities, originally Greek, to revolt from Persia; those
garrisoned by Persians he besieged and reduced.  Victorious in Caria,
he passed with equal success into Lycia <a href="#note-173" name="noteref-173"><small>173</small></a>, augmenting his fleet
and forces as he swept along.  But the Persians, not inactive, had now
assembled a considerable force in Pamphylia, and lay encamped on the
banks of the Eurymedon (B. C. 466), whose waters, sufficiently wide,
received their fleet.  The expected re-enforcement of eighty
Phoenician vessels from Cyprus induced the Persians to delay <a href="#note-174" name="noteref-174"><small>174</small></a>
actual hostilities.  But Cimon, resolved to forestall the anticipated
junction, sailed up the river, and soon forced the barbarian fleet,
already much more numerous than his own, into active engagement.  The
Persians but feebly supported the attack; driven up the river, the
crews deserted the ships, and hastened to join the army arrayed along
the coast.  Of the ships thus deserted, some were destroyed; and two
hundred triremes, taken by Cimon, yet more augmented his armament.
But the Persians, now advanced to the verge of the shore, presented a
long and formidable array, and Cimon, with some anxiety, saw the
danger he incurred in landing troops already much harassed by the late
action, while a considerable proportion of the hostile forces, far
more numerous, were fresh and unfatigued.  The spirit of the men, and
their elation at the late victory, bore down the fears of the general;
yet warm from the late action, he debarked his heavy-armed infantry,
and with loud shouts the Athenians rushed upon the foe.  The contest
was fierce&mdash;the slaughter great.  Many of the noblest Athenians fell
in the action.  Victory at length declared in favour of Cimon; the
Persians were put to flight, and the Greeks remained masters of the
battle and the booty&mdash;the last considerable.  Thus, on the same day,
the Athenians were victorious on both elements&mdash;an unprecedented
glory, which led the rhetorical Plutarch to declare&mdash;that Plataea and
Salamis were outshone.  Posterity, more discerning, estimates glory
not by the greatness of the victory alone, but the justice of the
cause.  And even a skirmish won by men struggling for liberty on their
own shores is more honoured than the proudest battle in which the
conquerors are actuated by the desire of vengeance or the lust of
enterprise.
</p>
<p>
III.  To the trophies of this double victory were soon added those of
a third, obtained over the eighty vessels of the Phoenicians off the
coast of Cyprus.  These signal achievements spread the terror of the
Athenian arms on remote as on Grecian shores.  Without adopting the
exaggerated accounts of injudicious authors as to the number of ships
and prisoners <a href="#note-175" name="noteref-175"><small>175</small></a>, it seems certain, at least, that the amount of
the booty was sufficient, in some degree, to create in Athens a moral
revolution&mdash;swelling to a vast extent the fortunes of individuals, and
augmenting the general taste for pomp, for luxury, and for splendour,
which soon afterward rendered Athens the most magnificent of the
Grecian states.
</p>
<p>
The navy of Persia thus broken, her armies routed, the scene of action
transferred to her own dominions, all designs against Greece were laid
aside.  Retreating, as it were, more to the centre of her vast
domains, she left the Asiatic outskirts to the solitude, rather of
exhaustion than of peace.  "No troops," boasted the later
rhetoricians, "came within a day's journey, on horseback, of the
Grecian seas."  From the Chelidonian isles on the Pamphylian coast, to
those <a href="#note-176" name="noteref-176"><small>176</small></a> twin rocks at the entrance of the Euxine, between which
the sea, chafed by their rugged base, roars unappeasably through its
mists of foam, no Persian galley was descried.  Whether this was the
cause of defeat or of acknowledged articles of peace, has been
disputed.  But, as will be seen hereafter, of the latter all
historical evidence is wanting.
</p>
<p>
In a subsequent expedition, Cimon, sailing from Athens with a small
force, wrested the Thracian Chersonese from the Persians&mdash;an exploit
which restored to him his own patrimony.
</p>
<p>
IV.  Cimon was now at the height of his fame and popularity.  His
share of the booty, and the recovery of the Chersonese, rendered him
by far the wealthiest citizen of Athens; and he continued to use his
wealth to cement his power.  His intercourse with other nations, his
familiarity with the oriental polish and magnificence, served to
elevate his manners from their early rudeness, and to give splendour
to his tastes.  If he had spent his youth among the wild soldiers of
Miltiades, the leisure of his maturer years was cultivated by an
intercourse with sages and poets.  His passion for the sex, which even
in its excesses tends to refine and to soften, made his only vice.  He
was the friend of every genius and every art; and, the link between
the lavish ostentation of Themistocles and the intellectual grace of
Pericles, he conducted, as it were, the insensible transition from the
age of warlike glory to that of civil pre-eminence.  He may be said to
have contributed greatly to diffuse that atmosphere of poetry and of
pleasure which even the meanest of the free Athenians afterward
delighted to respire.  He led the citizens more and more from the
recesses of private life; and carried out that social policy commenced
by Pisistratus, according to which all individual habits became merged
into one animated, complex, and excited public.  Thus, himself gay and
convivial, addicted to company, wine, and women, he encouraged shows
and spectacles, and invested them with new magnificence; he
embellished the city with public buildings, and was the first to erect
at Athens those long colonnades&mdash;beneath the shade of which, sheltered
from the western suns, that graceful people were accustomed to
assemble and converse.  The Agora, that universal home of the
citizens, was planted by him with the oriental planes; and the groves
of Academe, the immortal haunt of Plato, were his work.  That
celebrated garden, associated with the grateful and bright
remembrances of all which poetry can lend to wisdom, was, before the
time of Cimon, a waste and uncultivated spot.  It was his hand that
intersected it with walks and alleys, and that poured through its
green retreats the ornamental waters so refreshing in those climes,
and not common in the dry Attic soil, which now meandered in living
streams, and now sparkled into fountains.  Besides these works to
embellish, he formed others to fortify the city.  He completed the
citadel, hitherto unguarded on the south side; and it was from the
barbarian spoils deposited in the treasury that the expenses of
founding the Long Walls, afterward completed, were defrayed.
</p>
<p>
V.  In his conduct towards the allies, the natural urbanity of Cimon
served to conceal a policy deep-laid and grasping.  The other Athenian
generals were stern and punctilious in their demands on the
confederates; they required the allotted number of men, and, in
default of the supply, increased the rigour of their exactions.  Not
so Cimon&mdash;from those whom the ordinary avocations of a peaceful life
rendered averse to active service, he willingly accepted a pecuniary
substitute, equivalent to the value of those ships or soldiers they
should have furnished.  These sums, devoted indeed to the general
service, were yet appropriated to the uses of the Athenian navy; thus
the states, hitherto warlike, were artfully suffered to lapse into
peaceful and luxurious pursuits; and the confederates became at once,
under the most lenient pretexts, enfeebled and impoverished by the
very means which strengthened the martial spirit and increased the
fiscal resources of the Athenians.  The tributaries found too late,
when they ventured at revolt, that they had parted with the facilities
of resistance. <a href="#note-177" name="noteref-177"><small>177</small></a>
</p>
<p>
In the mean while it was the object of Cimon to sustain the naval
ardour and discipline of the Athenians; while the oar and the sword
fell into disuse with the confederates, he kept the greater part of
the citizens in constant rotation at maritime exercise or enterprise&mdash;
until experience and increasing power with one, indolence and gradual
subjection with the other, destroying the ancient equality in arms,
made the Athenians masters and their confederates subjects. <a href="#note-178" name="noteref-178"><small>178</small></a>
</p>
<p>
VI.  According to the wise policy of the ancients, the Athenians never
neglected a suitable opportunity to colonize; thus extending their
dominion while they draughted off the excess of their population, as
well as the more enterprising spirits whom adventure tempted or
poverty aroused.  The conquest of Eion had opened to the Athenians a
new prospect of aggrandizement, of which they were now prepared to
seize the advantages.  Not far from Eion, and on the banks of the
Strymon, was a place called the Nine Ways, afterward Amphipolis, and
which, from its locality and maritime conveniences, seemed especially
calculated for the site of a new city.  Thither ten thousand persons,
some confederates, some Athenians, had been sent to establish a
colony.  The views of the Athenians were not, however, in this
enterprise, bounded to its mere legitimate advantages.  About the same
time they carried on a dispute with the Thasians relative to certain
mines and places of trade on the opposite coasts of Thrace.  The
dispute was one of considerable nicety.  The Athenians, having
conquered Eion and the adjacent territory, claimed the possession by
right of conquest.  The Thasians, on the other hand, had anciently
possessed some of the mines and the monopoly of the commerce; they had
joined in the confederacy; and, asserting that the conquest had been
made, if by Athenian arms, for the federal good, they demanded that
the ancient privileges should revert to them.  The Athenian government
was not disposed to surrender a claim which proffered to avarice the
temptation of mines of gold.  The Thasians renounced the confederacy,
and thus gave to the Athenians the very pretext for hostilities which
the weaker state should never permit to the more strong.  While the
colony proceeded to its destination, part of the Athenian fleet, under
Cimon, sailed to Thasos&mdash;gained a victory by sea&mdash;landed on the
island&mdash;and besieged the city.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the new colonizers had become masters of the Nine Ways,
having dislodged the Edonian Thracians, its previous habitants.  But
hostility following hostility, the colonists were eventually utterly
routed and cut off in a pitched battle at Drabescus (B. C. 465), in
Edonia, by the united forces of all the neighbouring Thracians.
</p>
<p>
VII.  The siege of Thasos still continued, and the besieged took the
precaution to send to Sparta for assistance.  That sullen state had
long viewed with indignation the power of Athens; her younger warriors
clamoured against the inert indifference with which a city, for ages
so inferior to Sparta, had been suffered to gain the ascendency over
Greece.  In vain had Themistocles been removed; the inexhaustible
genius of the people had created a second Themistocles in Cimon.  The
Lacedaemonians, glad of a pretext for quarrel, courteously received
the Thasian ambassadors, and promised to distract the Athenian forces
by an irruption into Attica.  They were actively prepared in
concerting measures for this invasion, when sudden and complicated
afflictions, now to be related, forced them to abandon their designs,
and confine their attention to themselves.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  An earthquake, unprecedented in its violence, occurred in
Sparta.  In many places throughout Laconia the rocky soil was rent
asunder.  From Mount Taygetus, which overhung the city, and on which
the women of Lacedaemon were wont to hold their bacchanalian orgies,
huge fragments rolled into the suburbs.  The greater portion of the
city was absolutely overthrown; and it is said, probably with
exaggeration, that only five houses wholly escaped the shock.  This
terrible calamity did not cease suddenly as it came; its concussions
were repeated; it buried alike men and treasure: could we credit
Diodorus, no less than twenty thousand persons perished in the shock.
Thus depopulated, empoverished, and distressed, the enemies whom the
cruelty of Sparta nursed within her bosom resolved to seize the moment
to execute their vengeance and consummate her destruction.  Under
Pausanias we have seen before that the helots were already ripe for
revolt.  The death of that fierce conspirator checked, but did not
crush, their designs of freedom.  Now was the moment, when Sparta lay
in ruins&mdash;now was the moment to realize their dreams.  From field to
field, from village to village, the news of the earthquake became the
watchword of revolt.  Up rose the helots (B. C. 464)&mdash;they armed
themselves, they poured on&mdash;a wild, and gathering, and relentless
multitude, resolved to slay by the wrath of man all whom that of
nature had yet spared.  The earthquake that levelled Sparta rent her
chains; nor did the shock create one chasm so dark and wide as that
between the master and the slave.
</p>
<p>
It is one of the sublimest and most awful spectacles in history&mdash;that
city in ruins&mdash;the earth still trembling&mdash;the grim and dauntless
soldiery collected amid piles of death and ruin; and in such a time,
and such a scene, the multitude sensible, not of danger, but of wrong,
and rising, not to succour, but to revenge: all that should have
disarmed a feebler enmity, giving fire to theirs; the dreadest
calamity their blessing&mdash;dismay their hope it was as if the Great
Mother herself had summoned her children to vindicate the long-abused,
the all inalienable heritage derived from her; and the stir of the
angry elements was but the announcement of an armed and solemn union
between nature and the oppressed.
</p>
<p>
IX.  Fortunately for Sparta, the danger was not altogether unforeseen.
After the confusion and horror of the earthquake, and while the
people, dispersed, were seeking to save their effects, Archidamus,
who, four years before, had succeeded to the throne of Lacedaemon,
ordered the trumpets to sound as to arms.  That wonderful superiority
of man over matter which habit and discipline can effect, and which
was ever so visible among the Spartans, constituted their safety at
that hour.  Forsaking the care of their property, the Spartans seized
their arms, flocked around their king, and drew up in disciplined
array.  In her most imminent crisis, Sparta was thus saved.  The
helots approached, wild, disorderly, and tumultuous; they came intent
only to plunder and to slay; they expected to find scattered and
affrighted foes&mdash;they found a formidable army; their tyrants were
still their lords.  They saw, paused, and fled, scattering themselves
over the country&mdash;exciting all they met to rebellion, and soon, joined
with the Messenians, kindred to them by blood and ancient
reminiscences of heroic struggles, they seized that same Ithome which
their hereditary Aristodemus had before occupied with unforgotten
valour.  This they fortified; and, occupying also the neighbouring
lands, declared open war upon their lords.  As the Messenians were the
more worthy enemy, so the general insurrection is known by the name of
the Third Messenian War.
</p>
<p>
X.  While these events occurred in Sparta, Cimon, intrusting to others
the continued siege of Thasos, had returned to Athens <a href="#note-179" name="noteref-179"><small>179</small></a>.  He found
his popularity already shaken, and his power endangered.  The
democratic party had of late regained the influence it had lost on the
exile of Themistocles.  Pericles, son of Xanthippus (the accuser of
Miltiades), had, during the last six years, insensibly risen into
reputation: the house of Miltiades was fated to bow before the race of
Xanthippus, and hereditary opposition ended in the old hereditary
results.  Born of one of the loftiest families of Athens,
distinguished by the fame as the fortunes of his father, who had been
linked with Aristides in command of the Athenian fleet, and in whose
name had been achieved the victory of Mycale, the young Pericles found
betimes an easy opening to his brilliant genius and his high ambition.
He had nothing to contend against but his own advantages.  The beauty
of his countenance, the sweetness of his voice, and the blandness of
his address, reminded the oldest citizens of Pisistratus; and this
resemblance is said to have excited against him a popular jealousy
which he found it difficult to surmount.  His youth was passed
alternately in the camp and in the schools.  He is the first of the
great statesmen of his country who appears to have prepared himself
for action by study; Anaxagoras, Pythoclides, and Damon were his
tutors, and he was early eminent in all the lettered accomplishments
of his time.  By degrees, accustoming the people to his appearance in
public life, he became remarkable for an elaborate and impassioned
eloquence, hitherto unknown.  With his intellectual and meditative
temperament all was science; his ardour in action regulated by long
forethought, his very words by deliberate preparation.  Till his time,
oratory, in its proper sense, as a study and an art, was uncultivated
in Athens.  Pisistratus is said to have been naturally eloquent, and
the vigorous mind of Themistocles imparted at once persuasion and
force to his counsels.  But Pericles, aware of all the advantages to
be gained by words, embellished words with every artifice that his
imagination could suggest.  His speeches were often written
compositions, and the novel dazzle of their diction, and that
consecutive logic which preparation alone can impart to language,
became irresistible to a people that had itself become a Pericles.
Universal civilization, universal poetry, had rendered the audience
susceptible and fastidious; they could appreciate the ornate and
philosophical harangues of Pericles; and, the first to mirror to
themselves the intellectual improvements they had made, the first to
represent the grace and enlightenment, as Themistocles had been the
first to represent the daring and enterprise, of his time, the son of
Xanthippus began already to eclipse that very Cimon whose qualities
prepared the way for him.
</p>
<p>
XI.  We must not suppose, that in the contests between the
aristocratic and popular parties, the aristocracy were always on one
side.  Such a division is never to be seen in free constitutions.
There is always a sufficient party of the nobles whom conviction,
ambition, or hereditary predilections will place at the head of the
popular movement; and it is by members of the privileged order that
the order itself is weakened.  Athens in this respect, therefore,
resembled England, and as now in the latter state, so then at Athens,
it was often the proudest, the wealthiest, the most high-born of the
aristocrats that gave dignity and success to the progress of
democratic opinion.  There, too, the vehemence of party frequently
rendered politics an hereditary heirloom; intermarriages kept together
men of similar factions; and the memory of those who had been the
martyrs or the heroes of a cause mingled with the creed of their
descendants.  Thus, it was as natural that one of the race of that
Clisthenes who had expelled the Pisistratides, and popularized the
constitution, should embrace the more liberal side, as that a Russell
should follow out in one age the principles for which his ancestor
perished in another.  So do our forefathers become sponsors for
ourselves.  The mother of Pericles was the descendant of Clisthenes;
and though Xanthippus himself was of the same party as Aristides, we
may doubt, by his prosecution of Miltiades as well as by his connexion
with the Alcmaeonids, whether he ever cordially co-operated with the
views and the ambition of Cimon.  However this be, his brilliant son
cast himself at once into the arms of the more popular faction, and
opposed with all his energy the aristocratic predilections of Cimon.
Not yet, however, able to assume the lead to which he aspired (for it
had now become a matter of time as well as intellect to rise), he
ranged himself under Ephialtes, a personage of whom history gives us
too scanty details, although he enjoyed considerable influence,
increased by his avowed jealousy of the Spartans and his own
unimpeachable integrity.
</p>
<p>
XII.  It is noticeable, that men who become the leaders of the public,
less by the spur of passion than by previous study and conscious
talent&mdash;men whom thought and letters prepare for enterprise&mdash;are
rarely eager to advance themselves too soon.  Making politics a
science, they are even fastidiously alive to the qualities and the
experience demanded for great success; their very self-esteem renders
them seemingly modest; they rely upon time and upon occasion; and,
pushed forward rather by circumstance than their own exertions, it is
long before their ambition and their resources are fully developed.
Despite all his advantages, the rise of Pericles was gradual.
</p>
<p>
On the return of Cimon the popular party deemed itself sufficiently
strong to manifest its opposition.  The expedition to Thasos had not
been attended with results so glorious as to satisfy a people pampered
by a series of triumphs.  Cimon was deemed culpable for not having
taken advantage of the access into Macedonia, and added that country
to the Athenian empire.  He was even suspected and accused of
receiving bribes from Alexander, the king of Macedon.  Pericles <a href="#note-180" name="noteref-180"><small>180</small></a>
is said to have taken at first an active part in this prosecution; but
when the cause came on, whether moved by the instances of Cimon's
sister, or made aware of the injustice of the accusation, he conducted
himself favourably towards the accused.  Cimon himself treated the
charges with a calm disdain; the result was worthy of Athens and
himself.  He was honourably acquitted.
</p>
<p>
XIII.  Scarce was this impeachment over, when a Spartan ambassador
arrived at Athens to implore her assistance against the helots; the
request produced a vehement discussion.
</p>
<p>
Ephialtes strongly opposed the proposition to assist a city, sometimes
openly, always heartily, inimical to Athens.  "Much better," he
contended, "to suffer her pride to be humbled, and her powers of
mischief to be impaired."  Ever supporting and supported by the
Lacedaemonian party, whether at home or abroad, Cimon, on the other
hand, maintained the necessity of marching to the relief of Sparta.
"Do not," he said, almost sublimely&mdash;and his words are reported to
have produced a considerable impression on that susceptible assembly&mdash;
"do not suffer Greece to be mutilated, nor deprive Athens of her
companion!"
</p>
<p>
The more generous and magnanimous counsel prevailed with a generous
and magnanimous people; and Cimon was sent to the aid of Sparta at the
head of a sufficient force.  It may be observed, as a sign of the
political morality of the time, that the wrongs of the helots appear
to have been forgotten.  But such is the curse of slavery, that it
unfits its victims to be free, except by preparations and degrees.
And civilization, humanity, and social order are often enlisted on the
wrong side, in behalf of the oppressors, from the license and
barbarity natural to the victories of the oppressed.  A conflict
between the negroes and the planters in modern times may not be
unanalogous to that of the helots and Spartans; and it is often a
fatal necessity to extirpate the very men we have maddened, by our own
cruelties, to the savageness of beasts.
</p>
<p>
It would appear that, during the revolt of the helots and Messenians,
which lasted ten years, the Athenians, under Cimon, marched twice
<a href="#note-181" name="noteref-181"><small>181</small></a> to the aid of the Spartans.  In the first (B. C. 464) they
probably drove the scattered insurgents into the city of Ithome; in
the second (B. C. 461) they besieged the city.  In the interval Thasos
surrendered (B. C. 463); the inhabitants were compelled to level their
walls, to give up their shipping, to pay the arrear of tribute, to
defray the impost punctually in future, and to resign all claims on
the continent and the mines.
</p>
<p>
XIV.  Thus did the Athenians establish their footing on the Thracian
continent, and obtain the possession of the golden mines, which they
mistook for wealth.  In the second expedition of the Athenians, the
long-cherished jealousy between themselves and the Spartans could no
longer be smothered.  The former were applied to especially from their
skill in sieges, and their very science galled perhaps the pride of
the martial Spartans.  While, as the true art of war was still so
little understood, that even the Athenians were unable to carry the
town by assault, and compelled to submit to the tedious operations of
a blockade, there was ample leisure for those feuds which the
uncongenial habits and long rivalry of the nations necessarily
produced.  Proud of their Dorian name, the Spartans looked on the
Ionic race of Athens as aliens.  Severe in their oligarchic
discipline, they regarded the Athenian Demus as innovators; and, in
the valour itself of their allies, they detected a daring and restless
energy which, if serviceable now, might easily be rendered dangerous
hereafter.  They even suspected the Athenians of tampering with the
helots&mdash;led, it may be, to that distrust by the contrast, which they
were likely to misinterpret, between their own severity and the
Athenian mildness towards the servile part of their several
populations, and also by the existence of a powerful party at Athens,
which had opposed the assistance Cimon afforded.  With their usual
tranquil and wary policy, the Spartan government attempted to conceal
their real fears, and simply alleging they had no further need of
their assistance, dismissed the Athenians.  But that people,
constitutionally irritable, perceiving that, despite this hollow
pretext, the other allies, including the obnoxious Aeginetans, were
retained, received their dismissal as an insult.  Thinking justly that
they had merited a nobler confidence from the Spartans, they gave way
to their first resentment, and disregarding the league existing yet
between themselves and Sparta against the Mede&mdash;the form of which had
survived the spirit&mdash;they entered into an alliance with the Argives,
hereditary enemies of Sparta, and in that alliance the Aleuads of
Thessaly were included.
</p>
<p>
XV.  The obtaining of these decrees by the popular party was the
prelude to the fall of Cimon.  The talents of that great man were far
more eminent in war than peace; and despite his real or affected
liberality of demeanour, he wanted either the faculty to suit the
time, or the art to conceal his deficiencies.  Raised to eminence by
Spartan favour, he had ever too boldly and too imprudently espoused
the Spartan cause.  At first, when the Athenians obtained their naval
ascendency&mdash;and it was necessary to conciliate Sparta&mdash;the partiality
with which Cimon was regarded by that state was his recommendation;
now when, no longer to be conciliated, Sparta was to be dreaded and
opposed, it became his ruin.  It had long been his custom to laud the
Spartans at the expense of the Athenians, and to hold out their
manners as an example to the admiration of his countrymen.  It was a
favourite mode of reproof with him&mdash;"The Spartans would not have done
this."  It was even remembered against him that he had called his son
Lacedaemonius.  These predilections had of late rankled in the popular
mind; and now, when the Athenian force had been contumeliously
dismissed, it was impossible to forget that Cimon had obtained the
decree of the relief, and that the mortification which resulted from
it was the effect of his counsels.
</p>
<p>
Public spirit ran high against the Spartans, and at the head of the
Spartan faction in Athens stood Cimon.
</p>
<p>
XVI.  But at this time, other events, still more intimately connected
with the Athenian politics, conspired to weaken the authority of this
able general.  Those constitutional reforms, which are in reality
revolutions under a milder name, were now sweeping away the last
wrecks of whatever of the old aristocratic system was still left to
the Athenian commonwealth.
</p>
<p>
We have seen that the democratic party had increased in power by the
decree of Aristides, which opened all offices to all ranks.  This, as
yet, was productive less of actual than of moral effects.  The liberal
opinions possessed by a part of the aristocracy, and the legitimate
influence which in all countries belongs to property and high descent
(greatest, indeed, where the countries are most free)&mdash;secured, as a
general rule, the principal situations in the state to rank and
wealth.  But the moral effect of the decree was to elevate the lower
classes with a sense of their own power and dignity, and every victory
achieved over a foreign foe gave new authority to the people whose
voices elected the leader&mdash;whose right arms won the battle.
</p>
<p>
The constitution previous to Solon was an oligarchy of birth.  Solon
rendered it an aristocracy of property.  Clisthenes widened its basis
from property to population; as we have already seen, it was, in all
probability, Clisthenes also who weakened the more illicit and
oppressive influences of wealth, by establishing the ballot or secret
suffrage instead of the open voting, which was common in the time of
Solon.  It is the necessary constitution of society, that when one
class obtains power, the ancient checks to that power require
remodelling.  The Areopagus was designed by Solon as the aristocratic
balance to the popular assembly.  But in all states in which the
people and the aristocracy are represented, the great blow to the
aristocratic senate is given, less by altering its own constitution
than by infusing new elements of democracy into the popular assembly.
The old boundaries are swept away, not by the levelling of the bank,
but by the swelling of the torrent.  The checks upon democracy ought
to be so far concealed as to be placed in the representation of the
democracy itself; for checks upon its progress from without are but as
fortresses to be stormed; and what, when latent, was the influence of
a friend, when apparent, is the resistance of a foe.
</p>
<p>
The Areopagus, the constitutional bulwark of the aristocratic party of
Athens, became more and more invidious to the people.  And now, when
Cimon resisted every innovation on that assembly, he only ensured his
own destruction, while he expedited the policy he denounced.
Ephialtes directed all the force of the popular opinion against this
venerable senate; and at length, though not openly assisted by
Pericles <a href="#note-182" name="noteref-182"><small>182</small></a>, who took no prominent part in the contention, that
influential statesman succeeded in crippling its functions and
limiting its authority.
</p>
<p>
XVII.  I do not propose to plunge the reader into the voluminous and
unprofitable controversy on the exact nature of the innovations of
Ephialtes which has agitated the students of Germany.  It appears to
me most probable that the Areopagus retained the right of adjudging
cases of homicide <a href="#note-183" name="noteref-183"><small>183</small></a>, and little besides of its ancient
constitutional authority, that it lost altogether its most dangerous
power in the indefinite police it had formerly exercised over the
habits and morals of the people, that any control of the finances was
wisely transferred to the popular senate <a href="#note-184" name="noteref-184"><small>184</small></a>, that its irresponsible
character was abolished, and it was henceforth rendered accountable to
the people.  Such alterations were not made without exciting the deep
indignation of the aristocratic faction.
</p>
<p>
In all state reforms a great and comprehensive mind does not so much
consider whether each reform is just, as what will be the ultimate
ascendency given to particular principles.  Cimon preferred to all
constitutions a limited aristocracy, and his practical experience
regarded every measure in its general tendency towards or against the
system which he honestly advocated.
</p>
<p>
XVIII.  The struggle between the contending parties and principles had
commenced before Cimon's expedition to Ithome; the mortification
connected with that event, in weakening Cimon, weakened the
aristocracy itself.  Still his fall was not immediate <a href="#note-185" name="noteref-185"><small>185</small></a>, nor did
it take place as a single and isolated event, but as one of the
necessary consequences of the great political change effected by
Ephialtes.  All circumstances, however, conspired to place the son of
Miltiades in a situation which justified the suspicion and jealousy of
the Athenians.  Of all the enemies, how powerful soever, that Athens
could provoke, none were so dangerous as Lacedaemon.
</p>
<p>
Dark, wily, and implacable, the rugged queen of the Peloponnesus
reared her youth in no other accomplishments than those of stratagem
and slaughter.  Her enmity against Athens was no longer smothered.
Athens had everything to fear, not less from her influence than her
armies.  It was not, indeed, so much from the unsheathed sword as from
the secret councils of Sparta that danger was to be apprehended.  It
cannot be too often remembered, that among a great portion of the
Athenian aristocracy, the Spartan government maintained a considerable
and sympathetic intelligence.  That government ever sought to adapt
and mould all popular constitutions to her own oligarchic model; and
where she could not openly invade, she secretly sought to undermine,
the liberties of her neighbours.  Thus, in addition to all fear from
an enemy in the field, the Athenian democracy were constantly excited
to suspicion against a spy within the city: always struggling with an
aristocratic party, which aimed at regaining the power it had lost,
there was just reason to apprehend that that party would seize any
occasion to encroach upon the popular institutions; every feud with
Sparta consequently seemed to the Athenian people, nor without cause,
to subject to intrigue and conspiracy their civil freedom; and (as
always happens with foreign interference, whether latent or avowed)
exasperated whatever jealousies already existed against those for
whose political interests the interference was exerted.  Bearing this
in mind, we shall see no cause to wonder at the vehement opposition to
which Cimon was now subjected.  We are driven ourselves to search
deeply into the causes which led to his prosecution, as to that of
other eminent men in Athens, from want of clear and precise historical
details.  Plutarch, to whom, in this instance, we are compelled
chiefly to resort, is a most equivocal authority.  Like most
biographers, his care is to exalt his hero, though at the expense of
that hero's countrymen; and though an amiable writer, nor without some
semi-philosophical views in morals, his mind was singularly deficient
in grasp and in comprehension.  He never penetrates the subtle causes
of effects.  He surveys the past, sometimes as a scholar, sometimes as
a taleteller, sometimes even as a poet, but never as a statesman.
Thus, we learn from him little of the true reasons for the ostracism,
either of Aristides, of Themistocles, or of Cimon&mdash;points now
intricate, but which might then, alas! have been easily cleared up by
a profound inquirer, to the acquittal alike of themselves and of their
judges.  To the natural deficiencies of Plutarch we must add his party
predilections.  He was opposed to democratic opinions&mdash;and that
objection, slight in itself, or it might be urged against many of the
best historians and the wisest thinkers, is rendered weighty in that
he was unable to see, that in all human constitutions perfection is
impossible, that we must take the evil with the good, and that what he
imputes to one form of government is equally attributable to another.
For in what monarchy, what oligarchy, have not great men been
misunderstood, and great merits exposed to envy!
</p>
<p>
Thus, in the life of Cimon, Plutarch says that it was "on a slight
pretext" <a href="#note-186" name="noteref-186"><small>186</small></a> that that leader of the Spartan party in Athens was
subjected to the ostracism.  We have seen enough to convince us that,
whatever the pretext, the reasons, at least, were grave and solid&mdash;
that they were nothing short of Cimon's unvarying ardour for, and
constant association with, the principles and the government of that
state most inimical to Athens, and the suspicious policy of which was,
in all times&mdash;at that time especially&mdash;fraught with danger to her
power, her peace, and her institutions.  Could we penetrate farther
into the politics of the period, we might justify the Athenians yet
more.  Without calling into question the integrity and the patriotism
of Cimon, without supposing that he would have entered into any
intrigue against the Athenian independence of foreign powers&mdash;a
supposition his subsequent conduct effectually refutes&mdash;he might, as a
sincere and warm partisan of the nobles, and a resolute opposer of the
popular party, have sought to restore at home the aristocratic balance
of power, by whatever means his great rank, and influence, and
connexion with the Lacedaemonian party could afford him.  We are told,
at least, that he not only opposed all the advances of the more
liberal party&mdash;that he not only stood resolutely by the interests and
dignities of the Areopagus, which had ceased to harmonize with the
more modern institutions, but that he expressly sought to restore
certain prerogatives which that assembly had formally lost during his
foreign expeditions, and that he earnestly endeavoured to bring back
the whole constitution to the more aristocratic government established
by Clisthenes.  It is one thing to preserve, it is another to restore.
A people may be deluded under popular pretexts out of the rights they
have newly acquired, but they never submit to be openly despoiled of
them.  Nor can we call that ingratitude which is but the refusal to
surrender to the merits of an individual the acquisitions of a nation.
</p>
<p>
All things considered, then, I believe, that if ever ostracism was
justifiable, it was so in the case of Cimon&mdash;nay, it was perhaps
absolutely essential to the preservation of the constitution.  His
very honesty made him resolute in his attempts against that
constitution.  His talents, his rank, his fame, his services, only
rendered those attempts more dangerous.
</p>
<p>
XIX.  Could the reader be induced to view, with an examination equally
dispassionate, the several ostracisms of Aristides and Themistocles,
he might see equal causes of justification, both in the motives and in
the results.  The first was absolutely necessary for the defeat of the
aristocratic party, and the removal of restrictions on those energies
which instantly found the most glorious vents for action; the second
was justified by a similar necessity that produced similar effects.
To impartial eyes a people may be vindicated without traducing those
whom a people are driven to oppose.  In such august and complicated
trials the accuser and defendant may be both innocent.

</p>
<p>
I.  Cimon, summoned to the ostracism, was sentenced to its appointed
term of banishment&mdash;ten years.  By his removal, the situation of
Pericles became suddenly more prominent and marked, and he mingled
with greater confidence and boldness in public affairs.  The vigour of
the new administration was soon manifest.  Megara had hitherto been
faithful to the Lacedaemonian alliance&mdash;a dispute relative to the
settlement of frontiers broke out between that state and Corinth.
Although the Corinthian government, liberal and enlightened, was often
opposed to the Spartan oligarchy, it was still essential to the
interest of both those Peloponnesian states to maintain a firm general
alliance, and to keep the Peloponnesian confederacy as a
counterbalance to the restless ambition of the new head of the Ionian
league.  Sparta could not, therefore, have been slow in preferring the
alliance of Corinth to that of Megara.  On the other hand, Megara, now
possessed of a democratic constitution, had long since abandoned the
Dorian character and habits.  The situation of its territories, the
nature of its institutions, alike pointed to Athens as its legitimate
ally.  Thus, when the war broke out between Megara and Corinth, on the
side of the latter appeared Sparta, while Megara naturally sought the
assistance of Athens.  The Athenian government eagerly availed itself
of the occasion to increase the power which Athens was now rapidly
extending over Greece.  If we cast our eyes along the map of Greece,
we shall perceive that the occupation of Megara proffered peculiar
advantages.  It became at once a strong and formidable fortress
against any incursions from the Peloponnesus, while its seaports of
Nisaea and Pegae opened new fields, both of ambition and of commerce,
alike on the Saronic and the Gulf of Corinth.  The Athenians seized
willingly on the alliance thus offered to them, and the Megarians had
the weakness to yield both Megara and Pegae to Athenian garrisons,
while the Athenians fortified their position by long walls that united
Megara with its harbour at Nisaea.
</p>
<p>
II.  A new and more vast enterprise contributed towards the stability
of the government by draining off its bolder spirits, and diverting
the popular attention from domestic to foreign affairs.
</p>
<p>
It is necessary to pass before us, in brief review, the vicissitudes
of the Persian court.  In republican Greece, the history of the people
marches side by side with the biography of great men.  In despotic
Persia, all history dies away in the dark recesses and sanguinary
murthers of a palace governed by eunuchs and defended but by slaves.
</p>
<p>
In the year 465 B. C. the reign of the unfortunate Xerxes drew to its
close.  On his return to Susa, after the disastrous results of the
Persian invasion, he had surrendered himself to the indolent luxury of
a palace.  An able and daring traitor, named Artabanus <a href="#note-187" name="noteref-187"><small>187</small></a>, but who
seems to have been a different personage from that Artabanus whose
sagacity had vainly sought to save the armies of Xerxes from the
expedition to Greece, entered into a conspiracy against the feeble
monarch.  By the connivance of a eunuch, he penetrated at night the
chamber of the king&mdash;and the gloomy destinies of Xerxes were
consummated by assassination.  Artabanus sought to throw the guilt
upon Darius, the eldest son of the murdered king; and Artaxerxes, the
younger brother, seems to have connived at a charge which might render
himself the lawful heir to the throne.  Darius accordingly perished by
the same fate as his father.  The extreme youth of Artaxerxes had
induced Artabanus to believe that but a slender and insecure life now
stood between himself and the throne; but the young prince was already
master of the royal art of dissimulation: he watched his opportunity&mdash;
and by a counter-revolution Artabanus was sacrificed to the manes of
his victims. <a href="#note-188" name="noteref-188"><small>188</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Thus Artaxerxes obtained the undisturbed possession of the Persian
throne (B. C. 464).  The new monarch appears to have derived from
nature a stronger intellect than his father.  But the abuses, so rapid
and rank of growth in Eastern despotisms, which now ate away the
strength of the Persian monarchy, were already, perhaps, past the
possibility of reform.  The enormous extent of the ill-regulated
empire tempted the ambition of chiefs who might have plausibly hoped,
that as the Persian masters had now degenerated to the effeminacy of
the Assyrians they had supplanted, so the enterprise of a second Cyrus
might be crowned by a similar success.
</p>
<p>
Egypt had been rather overrun by Xerxes than subdued&mdash;and the spirit
of its ancient people waited only the occasion of revolt.  A Libyan
prince, of the name of Inarus, whose territories bordered Egypt,
entered that country (B. C. 460), and was hailed by the greater part
of the population as a deliverer.  The recent murder of Xerxes&mdash;the
weakness of a new reign, commenced in so sanguinary a manner, appeared
to favour their desire of independence; and the African adventurer
beheld himself at the head of a considerable force.  Having already
secured foreign subsidiaries, Inarus was anxious yet more to
strengthen himself abroad; and more than one ambassador was despatched
to Athens, soliciting her assistance, and proffering, in return, a
share in the government for whose establishment her arms were
solicited: a singular fatality, that the petty colony which, if we
believe tradition, had so many centuries ago settled in the then
obscure corners of Attica, should now be chosen the main auxiliary of
the parent state in her vital struggles for national independence.
</p>
<p>
III.  In acceding to the propositions of Inarus, Pericles yielded to
considerations wholly contrary to his after policy, which made it a
principal object to confine the energies of Athens within the limits
of Greece.  It is probable that that penetrating and scientific
statesman (if indeed he had yet attained to a position which enabled
him to follow out his own conceptions) saw that every new government
must dazzle either by great enterprises abroad or great changes at
home&mdash;and that he preferred the former.  There are few sacrifices that
a wary minister, newly-established, from whom high hopes are
entertained, and who can justify the destruction of a rival party only
by the splendour of its successor&mdash;will not hazard rather than incur
the contempt which follows disappointment.  He will do something that
is dangerous rather than do nothing that is brilliant.
</p>
<p>
Neither the hatred nor the fear of Persia was at an end in Athens; and
to carry war into the heart of her empire was a proposition eagerly
hailed.  The more democratic and turbulent portion of the populace,
viz., the seamen, had already been disposed of in an expedition of two
hundred triremes against Cyprus.  But the distant and magnificent
enterprise of Egypt&mdash;the hope of new empire&mdash;the lust of undiscovered
treasures&mdash;were more alluring than the reduction of Cyprus.  That
island was abandoned, and the fleet, composed both of Athenian and
confederate ships, sailed up the Nile.  Masters of that river, the
Athenians advanced to Memphis, the capital of Lower Egypt.  They
stormed and took two of the divisions of that city; the third, called
the White Castle (occupied by the Medes, the Persians, and such of the
Egyptians as had not joined the revolt), resisted their assault.
</p>
<p>
IV.  While thus occupied in Egypt, the Athenian arms were equally
employed in Greece.  The whole forces of the commonwealth were in
demand&mdash;war on every side.  The alliance with Megara not only created
an enemy in Corinth, but the Peloponnesian confederacy became involved
with the Attic: Lacedaemon herself, yet inert, but menacing; while the
neighbouring Aegina, intent and jealous, prepared for hostilities soon
manifest.
</p>
<p>
The Athenians forestalled the attack&mdash;made a descent on Haliae, in
Argolis&mdash;were met by the Corinthians and Epidaurians, and the result
of battle was the victory of the latter.  This defeat the Athenians
speedily retrieved at sea.  Off Cecryphalea, in the Saronic gulf, they
attacked and utterly routed the Peloponnesian fleet.  And now Aegina
openly declared war and joined the hostile league.  An important
battle was fought by these two maritime powers with the confederates
of either side.  The Athenians were victorious&mdash;took seventy ships&mdash;
and, pushing the advantage they had obtained, landed in Aegina and
besieged her city.  Three hundred heavy-armed Peloponnesians were
despatched to the relief of Aegina; while the Corinthians invaded the
Megarian territory, seized the passes of Geranea, and advanced to
Megara with their allies.  Never was occasion more propitious.  So
large a force in Egypt, so large a force at Aegina&mdash;how was it
possible for the Athenians to march to the aid of Megara?  They
appeared limited to the choice either to abandon Megara or to raise
the siege of Aegina: so reasoned the Peloponnesians.  But the
advantage of a constitution widely popular is, that the whole
community become soldiers in time of need.  Myronides, an Athenian of
great military genius, not unassisted by Pericles, whose splendid
qualities now daily developed themselves, was well adapted to give
direction to the enthusiasm of the people.  Not a man was called from
Aegina.  The whole regular force disposed of, there yet remained at
Athens those too aged and those too young for the ordinary service.
Under Myronides, boys and old men marched at once to the assistance of
their Megarian ally.  A battle ensued; both sides retiring, neither
considered itself defeated.  But the Corinthians retreating to
Corinth, the Athenians erected a trophy on the field.  The Corinthian
government received its troops with reproaches, and, after an interval
of twelve days, the latter returned to the scene of contest, and
asserting their claim to the victory, erected a trophy of their own.
During the work the Athenians sallied from Megara, where they had
ensconced themselves, attacked and put to flight the Corinthians; and
a considerable portion of the enemy turning into ground belonging to a
private individual, became entangled in a large pit or ditch, from
which was but one outlet, viz., that by which they had entered.  At
this passage the Athenians stationed their heavy-armed troops, while
the light-armed soldiers surrounded the ditch, and with the missiles
of darts and stones put the enemy to death.  The rest (being the
greater part) of the Corinthian forces effected a safe but
dishonourable retreat.
</p>
<p>
V.  This victory effected and Megara secured&mdash;although Aegina still
held out, and although the fate of the Egyptian expedition was still
unknown&mdash;the wonderful activity of the government commenced what even
in times of tranquillity would have been a great and arduous
achievement.  To unite their city with its seaports, they set to work
at the erection of the long walls, which extended from Athens both to
Phalerus and Piraeus.  Under Cimon, preparations already had been made
for the undertaking, and the spoils of Persia now provided the means
for the defence of Athens.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Spartans still continued at the siege of Ithome.  We
must not imagine that all the helots had joined in the revolt.  This,
indeed, would be almost to suppose the utter disorganization of the
Spartan state.  The most luxurious subjects of a despotism were never
more utterly impotent in procuring for themselves the necessaries of
life, than were the hardy and abstemious freemen of the Dorian Sparta.
It was dishonour for a Spartan to till the land&mdash;to exercise a trade.
He had all the prejudices against any calling but that of arms which
characterized a noble of the middle ages.
</p>
<p>
As is ever the case in the rebellion of slaves, the rise was not
universal; a sufficient number of these wretched dependants remained
passive and inert to satisfy the ordinary wants of their masters, and
to assist in the rebuilding of the town.  Still the Spartans were
greatly enfeebled, crippled, and embarrassed by the loss of the rest:
and the siege of Ithome sufficed to absorb their attention, and to
make them regard without open hostilities, if with secret enmity, the
operations of the Athenians.  The Spartan alliance formally dissolved
&mdash;Megara, with its command of the Peloponnesus seized&mdash;the Doric city
of Corinth humbled and defeated&mdash;Aegina blockaded; all these&mdash;the
Athenian proceedings&mdash;the Spartans bore without any formal declaration
of war.
</p>
<p>
VI.  And now, in the eighth year of the Messenian war, piety succeeded
where pride and revenge had failed, and the Spartans permitted other
objects to divide their attention with the siege of Ithome.  It was
one of the finest characteristics of that singular people, their
veneration for antiquity.  For the little, rocky, and obscure
territory of Doris, whence tradition derived their origin, they felt
the affection and reverence of sons.  A quarrel arising between the
people of this state and the neighbouring Phocians, the latter invaded
Doris, and captured one of its three towns <a href="#note-189" name="noteref-189"><small>189</small></a>.  The Lacedaemonians
marched at once to the assistance of their reputed father-land, with
an army of no less than fifteen hundred heavy-armed Spartans and ten
thousand of their Peloponnesian allies <a href="#note-190" name="noteref-190"><small>190</small></a>, under the command of
Nicomedes, son of Cleombrotus, and guardian of their king Pleistoanax,
still a minor.  They forced the Phocians to abandon the town they had
taken; and having effectually protected Doris by a treaty of peace
between the two nations, prepared to return home.  But in this they
were much perplexed; the pass of Geranea was now occupied by the
Athenians: Megara, too, and Pegae were in their hands.  Should they
pass by sea through the Gulf of Crissa, an Athenian squadron already
occupied that passage.  Either way they were intercepted <a href="#note-191" name="noteref-191"><small>191</small></a>.  Under
all circumstances, they resolved to halt a while in Boeotia, and watch
an opportunity to effect their return.  But with these ostensible
motives for that sojourn assigned by Thucydides, there was another
more deep and latent.  We have had constant occasion to remark how
singularly it was the Spartan policy to plot against the constitution
of free states, and how well-founded was the Athenian jealousy of the
secret interference of the Grecian Venice.
</p>
<p>
Halting now in Boeotia, Nicomedes entered into a clandestine
communication with certain of the oligarchic party in Athens, the
object of the latter being the overthrow of the existent popular
constitution.  With this object was certainly linked the recall of
Cimon, though there is no reason to believe that great general a party
in the treason.  This conspiracy was one main reason of the halt in
Boeotia.  Another was, probably, the conception of a great and politic
design, glanced at only by historians, but which, if successful, would
have ranked among the masterpieces of Spartan statesmanship.  This
design was&mdash;while Athens was to be weakened by internal divisions, and
her national spirit effectually curbed by the creation of an
oligarchy, the tool of Sparta&mdash;to erect a new rival to Athens in the
Boeotian Thebes.  It is true that this project was not, according to
Diodorus, openly apparent until after the battle of Tanagra.  But such
a scheme required preparation; and the sojourn of Nicomedes in Boeotia
afforded him the occasion to foresee its possibility and prepare his
plans.  Since the Persian invasion, Thebes had lost her importance,
not only throughout Greece, but throughout Boeotia, her dependant
territory.  Many of the states refused to regard her as their capital,
and the Theban government desired to regain its power.  Promises to
make war upon Athens rendered the Theban power auxiliary to Sparta:
the more Thebes was strengthened, the more Athens was endangered: and
Sparta, ever averse to quitting the Peloponnesus, would thus erect a
barrier to the Athenian arms on the very frontiers of Attica.
</p>
<p>
VII.  While such were the designs and schemes of Nicomedes, the
conspiracy of the aristocratic party could not be so secret in Athens
but what some rumour, some suspicion, broke abroad.  The people became
alarmed and incensed.  They resolved to anticipate the war; and,
judging Nicomedes cut off from retreat, and embarrassed and confined
in his position, they marched against him with a thousand Argives,
with a band of Thessalian horse, and some other allied troops drawn
principally from Ionia, which, united to the whole force of the armed
population within their walls, amounted, in all, to fourteen thousand
men.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  It is recorded by Plutarch, that during their march Cimon
appeared, and sought permission to join the army.  This was refused by
the senate of Five Hundred, to whom the petition was referred, not
from any injurious suspicion of Cimon, but from a natural fear that
his presence, instead of inspiring confidence, would create confusion;
and that it might be plausibly represented that he sought less to
resist the Spartans than to introduce them into Athens&mdash;a proof how
strong was the impression against him, and how extensive had been the
Spartan intrigues.  Cimon retired, beseeching his friends to vindicate
themselves from the aspersions cast upon them.  Placing the armour of
Cimon&mdash;a species of holy standard&mdash;in their ranks, a hundred of the
warmest supporters among his tribe advanced to battle conscious of the
trust committed to their charge.
</p>
<p>
IX.  In the territory of Tanagra a severe engagement took place.  On
that day Pericles himself fought in the thickest part of the battle
(B. C. 457); exposing himself to every danger, as if anxious that the
loss of Cimon should not be missed.  The battle was long, obstinate,
and even: when in the midst of it, the Thessalian cavalry suddenly
deserted to the Spartans.  Despite this treachery, the Athenians, well
supported by the Argives, long maintained their ground with advantage.
But when night separated the armies <a href="#note-192" name="noteref-192"><small>192</small></a>, victory remained with the
Spartans and their allies. <a href="#note-193" name="noteref-193"><small>193</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The Athenians were not, however, much disheartened by defeat, nor did
the Spartans profit by their advantage.  Anxious only for escape,
Nicomedes conducted his forces homeward, passed through Megara,
destroying the fruit-trees on his march; and, gaining the pass of
Geranea, which the Athenians had deserted to join the camp at Tanagra,
arrived at Lacedaemon.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the Thebans took advantage of the victory to extend their
authority, agreeably to the project conceived with Sparta.  Thebes now
attempted the reduction of all the cities of Boeotia.  Some submitted,
others opposed.
</p>
<p>
X.  Aware of the necessity of immediate measures against a neighbour,
brave, persevering, and ambitious, the Athenian government lost no
time in recruiting its broken forces.  Under Myronides, an army,
collected from the allies and dependant states, was convened to
assemble upon a certain day.  Many failed the appointment, and the
general was urged to delay his march till their arrival.  "It is not
the part of a general," said Myronides, sternly, "to await the
pleasure of his soldiers!  By delay I read an omen of the desire of
the loiterers to avoid the enemy.  Better rely upon a few faithful
than on many disaffected."
</p>
<p>
With a force comparatively small, Myronides commenced his march,
entered Boeotia sixty-two days only after the battle of Tanagra, and,
engaging the Boeotians at Oenophyta, obtained a complete and splendid
victory (B. C. 456).  This battle, though Diodorus could find no
details of the action, was reckoned by Athens among the most glorious
she had ever achieved; preferred by the vain Greeks even to those of
Marathon and Plataea, inasmuch as Greek was opposed to Greek, and not
to the barbarians.  Those who fell on the Athenian side were first
honoured by public burial in the Ceramichus&mdash;"As men," says Plato,
"who fought against Grecians for the liberties of Greece."  Myronides
followed up his victory by levelling the walls of Tanagra.  All
Boeotia, except Thebes herself, was brought into the Athenian
alliance&mdash;as democracies in the different towns, replacing the
oligarchical governments, gave the moral blow to the Spartan
ascendency.  Thus, in effect, the consequences of the battle almost
deserved the eulogies bestowed upon the victory.  Those consequences
were to revolutionize nearly all the states in Boeotia; and, by
calling up a democracy in each state, Athens at once changed enemies
into allies.
</p>
<p>
From Boeotia, Myronides marched to Phocis, and, pursuing the same
policy, rooted out the oligarchies, and established popular
governments.  The Locrians of Opus gave a hundred of their wealthiest
citizens as hostages.  Returned to Athens, Myronides was received with
public rejoicings <a href="#note-194" name="noteref-194"><small>194</small></a>, and thus closed a short but brilliant
campaign, which had not only conquered enemies, but had established
everywhere garrisons of friends.
</p>
<p>
XI.  Although the banishment of Cimon had appeared to complete the
triumph of the popular party in Athens, his opinions were not banished
also.  Athens, like all free states, was ever agitated by the feud of
parties, at once its danger and its strength.  Parties in Athens were,
however, utterly unlike many of those that rent the peace of the
Italian republics; nor are they rightly understood in the vague
declamations of Barthelemi or Mitford; they were not only parties of
names and men&mdash;they were also parties of principles&mdash;the parties of
restriction and of advance.  And thus the triumph of either was
invariably followed by the triumph of the principle it espoused.
Nobler than the bloody contests of mere faction, we do not see in
Athens the long and sweeping proscriptions, the atrocious massacres
that attended the party-strifes of ancient Rome or of modern Italy.
The ostracism, or the fine, of some obnoxious and eminent partisans,
usually contented the wrath of the victorious politicians.  And in the
advance of a cause the people found the main vent for their passions.
I trust, however, that I shall not be accused of prejudice when I
state as a fact, that the popular party in Athens seems to have been
much more moderate and less unprincipled even in its excesses than its
antagonists.  We never see it, like the Pisistratidae, leagued with
the Persian, nor with Isagoras, betraying Athens to the Spartan.  What
the oligarchic faction did when triumphant, we see hereafter in the
establishment of the Thirty Tyrants.  And compared with their
offences, the ostracism of Aristides, or the fine and banishment of
Cimon, lose all their colours of wrong.
</p>
<p>
XII.  The discontented advocates for an oligarchy, who had intrigued
with Nicomedes, had been foiled in their object, partly by the conduct
of Cimon in disavowing all connexion with them, partly by the retreat
of Nicomedes himself.  Still their spirit was too fierce to suffer
them to forego their schemes without a struggle, and after the battle
of Tanagra they broke out into open conspiracy against the republic.
</p>
<p>
The details of this treason are lost to us; it is one of the darkest
passages of Athenian history.  From scattered and solitary references
we can learn, however, that for a time it threatened the democracy
with ruin. <a href="#note-195" name="noteref-195"><small>195</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The victory of the Spartans at Tanagra gave strength to the Spartan
party in Athens; it also inspired with fear many of the people; it was
evidently desirable rather to effect a peace with Sparta than to
hazard a war.  Who so likely to effect that peace as the banished
Cimon?  Now was the time to press for his recall.  Either at this
period, or shortly afterward, Ephialtes, his most vehement enemy, was
barbarously murdered&mdash;according to Aristotle, a victim to the hatred
of the nobles.
</p>
<p>
XIII.  Pericles had always conducted his opposition to Cimon with
great dexterity and art; and indeed the aristocratic leaders of
contending parties are rarely so hostile to each other as their
subordinate followers suppose.  In the present strife for the recall
of his rival, amid all the intrigues and conspiracies, the open
violence and the secret machination, which threatened not only the
duration of the government, but the very existence of the republic,
Pericles met the danger by proposing himself the repeal of Cimon's
sentence.
</p>
<p>
Plutarch, with a childish sentimentality common to him when he means
to be singularly effective, bursts into an exclamation upon the
generosity of this step, and the candour and moderation of those
times, when resentments could be so easily laid aside.  But the
profound and passionless mind of Pericles was above all the weakness
of a melodramatic generosity.  And it cannot be doubted that this
measure was a compromise between the government and the more moderate
and virtuous of the aristocratic party.  Perhaps it was the most
advantageous compromise Pericles was enabled to effect; for by
concession with respect to individuals, we can often prevent
concession as to things.  The recall <a href="#note-196" name="noteref-196"><small>196</small></a> of the great leader of the
anti-popular faction may have been deemed equivalent to the surrender
of many popular rights.  And had we a deeper insight into the
intrigues of that day and the details of the oligarchic conspiracy, I
suspect we should find that, by recalling Cimon, Pericles saved the
constitution. <a href="#note-197" name="noteref-197"><small>197</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XIV.  The first and most popular benefit anticipated from the recall
of the son of Miltiades in a reconciliation between Sparta and Athens,
was not immediately realized further than by an armistice of four
months. <a href="#note-198" name="noteref-198"><small>198</small></a>
</p>
<p>
About this time the long walls of the Piraeus were completed (B. C.
455), and shortly afterward Aegina yielded to the arms of the
Athenians (B. C. 455), upon terms which subjected the citizens of that
gallant and adventurous isle (whose achievements and commerce seem no
less a miracle than the greatness of Athens when we survey the limits
of their narrow and rocky domain) to the rival they had long so
fearlessly, nor fruitlessly braved.  The Aeginetans surrendered their
shipping, demolished their walls, and consented to the payment of an
annual tribute.  And so was fulfilled the proverbial command of
Pericles, that Aegina ought not to remain the eyesore of Athens.
</p>
<p>
XV.  Aegina reduced, the Athenian fleet of fifty galleys, manned by
four thousand men <a href="#note-199" name="noteref-199"><small>199</small></a>, under the command of Tolmides,
circumnavigated the Peloponnesus&mdash;the armistice of four months had
expired&mdash;and, landing in Laconia, Tolmides burnt Gythium, a dock of
the Lacedaemonians; took Chalcis, a town belonging to Corinth, and,
debarking at Sicyon, engaged and defeated the Sicyonians.  Thence
proceeding to Cephallenia, he mastered the cities of that isle; and
descending at Naupactus, on the Corinthian gulf, wrested it from the
Ozolian Locrians.
</p>
<p>
In the same year with this expedition, and in the tenth year of the
siege (B. C. 455), Ithome surrendered to Lacedaemon.  The long and
gallant resistance of that town, the precipitous site of which nature
herself had fortified, is one of the most memorable and glorious
events in the Grecian history; and we cannot but regret that the
imperfect morality of those days, which saw glory in the valour of
freemen, rebellion only in that of slaves, should have left us but
frigid and scanty accounts of so obstinate a siege.  To posterity
neither the cause nor the achievements of Marathon or Plataea, seem
the one more holy, the other more heroic, than this long defiance of
Messenians and helots against the prowess of Sparta and the aid of her
allies.  The reader will rejoice to learn that it was on no
dishonourable terms that the city at last surrendered.  Life and free
permission to depart was granted to the besieged, and recorded by a
pillar erected on the banks of the Alpheus <a href="#note-200" name="noteref-200"><small>200</small></a>.  But such of the
helots as had been taken in battle or in the neighbouring territory
were again reduced to slavery&mdash;the ringleaders so apprehended alone
executed. <a href="#note-201" name="noteref-201"><small>201</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The gallant defenders of Ithome having conditioned to quit for ever
the Peloponnesus, Tolmides invested them with the possession of his
new conquest of Naupactus.  There, under a democratic government,
protected by the power of Athens, they regained their ancient freedom,
and preserved their hereditary name of Messenians&mdash;long distinguished
from their neighbours by their peculiar dialect.
</p>
<p>
XVI.  While thus, near at home, the Athenians had extended their
conquests and cemented their power, the adventurers they had
despatched to the Nile were maintaining their strange settlement with
more obstinacy than success.  At first, the Athenians and their ally,
the Libyan Inarus, had indeed, as we have seen, obtained no
inconsiderable advantage.
</p>
<p>
Anxious to detach the Athenians from the Egyptian revolt, Artaxerxes
had despatched an ambassador to Sparta, in order to prevail upon that
state to make an excursion into Attica, and so compel the Athenians to
withdraw their troops from Egypt.  The liability of the Spartan
government to corrupt temptation was not unknown to a court which had
received the Spartan fugitives; and the ambassador was charged with
large treasures to bribe those whom he could not otherwise convince.
Nevertheless, the negotiation failed; the government could not be
induced to the alliance with the Persian king.  There was indeed a
certain spirit of honour inherent in that haughty nation which, if not
incompatible with cunning and intrigue, held at least in profound
disdain an alliance with the barbarian, for whatsoever ends.  But, in
fact, the Spartans were then entirely absorbed in the reduction of
Ithome, and the war in Arcady; and it would, further, have been the
height of impolicy in that state, if meditating any designs against
Athens, to assist in the recall of an army which it was its very
interest to maintain employed in distant and perilous expeditions.
</p>
<p>
The ambassador had the satisfaction indeed of wasting some of his
money, but to no purpose; and he returned without success to Asia.
Artaxerxes then saw the necessity of arousing himself to those active
exertions which the feebleness of an exhausted despotism rendered the
final, not the first resort.  Under Megabyzus an immense army was
collected; traversing Syria and Phoenicia, it arrived in Egypt,
engaged the Egyptian forces in a pitched battle, and obtained a
complete victory.  Thence marching to Memphis, it drove the Greeks
from their siege of the White Castle, till then continued, and shut
them up in Prosopitis, an island in the Nile, around which their ships
lay anchored.  Megabyzus ordered the channel to be drained by dikes,
and the vessels, the main force of the Athenians, were left stranded.
Terrified by this dexterous manoeuvre, as well as by the success of
the Persians, the Egyptians renounced all further resistance; and the
Athenians were deprived at once of their vessels and their allies.
<a href="#note-202" name="noteref-202"><small>202</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XVII.  Nothing daunted, and inspired by their disdain no less than by
their valour, the Athenians were yet to the barbarian what the Norman
knights were afterward to the Greeks.  They burnt their vessels that
they might be as useless to the enemy as to themselves, and, exhorting
each other not to dim the glory of their past exploits, shut up still
in the small town of Byblus situated in the isle of Prosopitis,
resolved to defend themselves to the last.
</p>
<p>
The blockade endured a year and a half, such was the singular
ignorance of the art of sieges in that time.  At length, when the
channel was drained, as I have related, the Persians marched across
the dry bed, and carried the place by a land assault.  So ended this
wild and romantic expedition.  The greater part of the Athenians
perished; a few, however, either forced their way by arms, or, as
Diodorus more probably relates, were permitted by treaty to retire,
out of the Egyptian territory.  Taking the route of Libya, they
arrived at Cyrene, and finally reached Athens.
</p>
<p>
Inarus, the author of the revolt, was betrayed, and perished on the
cross, and the whole of Egypt once more succumbed to the Persian yoke,
save only that portion called the marshy or fenny parts (under the
dominion of a prince named Amyrtaeus), protected by the nature of the
soil and the proverbial valour of the inhabitants.  Meanwhile a
squadron of fifty vessels, despatched by Athens to the aid of their
countrymen, entered the Mendesian mouth of the Nile too late to
prevent the taking of Byblus.  Here they were surprised and defeated
by the Persian troops and a Phoenician fleet (B. C. 455), and few
survived a slaughter which put the last seal on the disastrous results
of the Egyptian expedition.
</p>
<p>
At home the Athenians continued, however, their military operations.
Thessaly, like the rest of Greece, had long shaken off the forms of
kingly government, but the spirit of monarchy still survived in a
country where the few were opulent and the multitude enslaved.  The
Thessalian republics, united by an assembly of deputies from the
various towns, elected for their head a species of protector&mdash;who
appears to have possessed many of the characteristics of the podesta
of the Italian states.  His nominal station was that of military
command&mdash;a station which, in all save the most perfect constitutions,
comprehends also civil authority.  The name of Tagus was given to this
dangerous chief, and his power and attributes so nearly resembled
those of a monarch, that even Thucydides confers on a Tagus the title
of king.  Orestes, one of these princes, had been driven from his
country by a civil revolution.  He fled to Athens, and besought her
assistance to effect his restoration.  That the Athenians should exert
themselves in favour of a man whose rank so nearly resembled the
odious dignity of a monarch, appears a little extraordinary.  But as
the Tagus was often the favourite of the commonalty and the foe of the
aristocratic party, it is possible that, in restoring Orestes, the
Athenians might have seen a new occasion to further the policy so
triumphantly adopted in Boeotia and Phocis&mdash;to expel a hostile
oligarchy and establish a friendly democracy <a href="#note-203" name="noteref-203"><small>203</small></a>.  Whatever their
views, they decided to yield to the exile the assistance he demanded,
and under Myronides an army in the following year accompanied Orestes
into Thessaly.  They were aided by the Boeotians and Phocians.
Myronides marched to Pharsalus, a Thessalian city, and mastered the
surrounding country; but the obstinate resistance of the city
promising a more protracted blockade than it was deemed advisable to
await, the Athenians raised the siege without effecting the object of
the expedition.
</p>
<p>
XVIII.  The possession of Pegae and the new colony of Naupactus <a href="#note-204" name="noteref-204"><small>204</small></a>
induced the desire of extending the Athenian conquests on the
neighbouring coasts, and the government were naturally anxious to
repair the military honours of Athens&mdash;lessened in Egypt, and
certainly not increased in Thessaly.  With a thousand Athenian
soldiers, Pericles himself set out for Pegae.  Thence the fleet, there
anchored, made a descent on Sicyon; Pericles defeated the Sicyonians
in a pitched battle, and besieged the city; but, after some fruitless
assaults, learning that the Spartans were coming to the relief of the
besieged, he quitted the city, and, re-enforced by some Achaeans,
sailed to the opposite side of the continent, crossed over the
Corinthian Bay, besieged the town of Oeniadae in Acarnania (B. C. 454)
(the inhabitants of which Pausanias <a href="#note-205" name="noteref-205"><small>205</small></a> styles the hereditary
enemies of the Athenians), ravaged the neighbouring country, and bore
away no inconsiderable spoils.  Although he reduced no city, the
successes of Pericles were signal enough to render the campaign
triumphant <a href="#note-206" name="noteref-206"><small>206</small></a>; and it gratified the national pride and resentment
to have insulted the cities and wasted the lands of the Peloponnesus.
</p>
<p>
These successes were sufficient to render a peace with Sparta and her
allies advisable for the latter, while they were not sufficiently
decided to tempt the Athenians to prolong irregular and fruitless
hostilities.  Three years were consumed without further aggressions on
either side, and probably in negotiations for peace.  At the end of
that time, the influence and intervention of Cimon obtained a truce of
five years between the Athenians and the Peloponnesians.
</p>
<p>
XIX.  The truce with the Peloponnesians (B. C. 450) removed the main
obstacle to those more bright and extensive prospects of enterprise
and ambition which the defeat of the Persians had opened to the
Athenians.  In that restless and unpausing energy, which is the
characteristic of an intellectual republic, there seems, as it were, a
kind of destiny: a power impossible to resist urges the state from
action to action, from progress to progress, with a rapidity dangerous
while it dazzles; resembling in this the career of individuals
impelled onward, first to obtain, and thence to preserve, power, and
who cannot struggle against the fate which necessitates them to soar,
until, by the moral gravitation of human things, the point which has
no beyond is attained; and the next effort to rise is but the prelude
of their fall.  In such states Time indeed moves with gigantic
strides; years concentrate what would be the epochs of centuries in
the march of less popular institutions.  The planet of their fortunes
rolls with an equal speed through the cycle of internal civilization
as of foreign glory.  The condition of their brilliant life is the
absence of repose.  The accelerated circulation of the blood
beautifies but consumes, and action itself, exhausting the stores of
youth by its very vigour, becomes a mortal but divine disease.
</p>
<p>
XX.  When Athens rose to the ascendency of Greece, it was necessary to
the preservation of that sudden and splendid dignity that she should
sustain the naval renown by which it had been mainly acquired.  There
is but one way to sustain reputation, viz., to increase it and the
memory of past glories becomes dim unless it be constantly refreshed
by new.  It must also be borne in mind that the maritime habits of the
people had called a new class into existence in the councils of the
state.  The seamen, the most democratic part of the population, were
now to be conciliated and consulted: it was requisite to keep them in
action, for they were turbulent&mdash;in employment, for they were poor:
and thus the domestic policy and the foreign interests of Athens alike
conspired to necessitate the prosecution of maritime enterprise.
</p>
<p>
XXI.  No longer harassed and impeded by fears of an enemy in the
Peloponnesus, the lively imagination of the people readily turned to
more dazzling and profitable warfare.  The Island of Cyprus had (we
have seen) before attracted the ambition of the mistress of the
Aegaean.  Its possession was highly advantageous, whether for military
or commercial designs, and once subjected, the fleet of the Athenians
might readily retain the dominion.  Divided into nine petty states,
governed, not by republican, but by monarchical institutions, the
forces of the island were distracted, and the whole proffered an easy
as well as glorious conquest; while the attempt took the plausible
shape of deliverance, inasmuch as Persia, despite the former successes
of Cimon, still arrogated the supremacy over the island, and the war
was, in fact, less against Cyprus than against Persia.  Cimon, who
ever affected great and brilliant enterprises, and whose main policy
it was to keep the Athenians from the dangerous borders of the
Peloponnesus, hastened to cement the truce he had formed with the
states of that district, by directing the spirit of enterprise to the
conquest of Cyprus.
</p>
<p>
Invested with the command of two hundred galleys, he set sail for that
island (B. C. 450) <a href="#note-207" name="noteref-207"><small>207</small></a>.  But designs more vast were associated with
this enterprise.  The objects of the late Egyptian expedition still
tempted, and sixty vessels of the fleet were despatched to Egypt to
the assistance of Amyrtaeus, who, yet unconquered, in the marshy
regions, sustained the revolt against the Persian king.
</p>
<p>
Artabazus commanded the Persian forces, and with a fleet of three
hundred vessels he ranged himself in sight of Cyprus.  Cimon, however,
landing on the island, succeeded in capturing many of its principal
towns.  Humbled and defeated, it was not the policy of Persia to
continue hostilities with an enemy from whom it had so much to fear
and so little to gain.  It is not, therefore, altogether an improbable
account of the later authorities, that ambassadors with proposals of
peace were formally despatched to Athens.  But we must reject as a
pure fable the assertions that a treaty was finally agreed upon, by
which it was decreed, on the one hand, that the independence of the
Asiatic Greek towns should be acknowledged, and that the Persian
generals should not advance within three days' march of the Grecian
seas; nor should a Persian vessel sail within the limit of Phaselis
and the Cyanean rocks; while, on the other hand, the Athenians were
bound not to enter the territories of Artaxerxes <a href="#note-208" name="noteref-208"><small>208</small></a>.  No such
arrangement was known to Thucydides; no reference is ever made to such
a treaty in subsequent transactions with Persia.  A document,
professing to be a copy of this treaty, was long extant; but it was
undoubtedly the offspring of a weak credulity or an ingenious
invention.  But while negotiations, if ever actually commenced, were
yet pending, Cimon was occupied in the siege of Citium, where famine
conspired with the obstinacy of the besieged to protract the success
of his arms.  It is recorded among the popular legends of the day that
Cimon <a href="#note-209" name="noteref-209"><small>209</small></a> sent a secret mission to the oracle of Jupiter Ammon.
"Return," was the response to the messengers; "Cimon is with me!"  The
messengers did return to find the son of Miltiades was no more.  He
expired during the blockade of Citium (B. C. 449).  By his orders his
death was concealed, the siege raised, and, still under the magic of
Cimon's name, the Athenians engaging the Phoenicians and Cilicians off
the Cyprian Salamis, obtained signal victories both by land and sea.
Thence, joined by the squadron despatched to Egypt, which, if it did
not share, did not retrieve, the misfortunes of the previous
expedition, they returned home.
</p>
<p>
The remains of Cimon were interred in Athens, and the splendid
monument consecrated to his name was visible in the time of Plutarch.

</p>
<p>
I.  Before we pass to the administration of Pericles&mdash;a period so
brilliant in the history not more of Athens than of art&mdash;it may not be
unseasonable to take a brief survey of the progress which the
Athenians had already made in civilization and power (B. C. 449).
</p>
<p>
The comedians and the rhetoricians, when at a later period they boldly
represented to the democracy, in a mixture of satire and of truth, the
more displeasing features of the popular character, delighted to draw
a contrast between the new times and the old.  The generation of men
whom Marathon and Salamis had immortalized were, according to these
praisers of the past, of nobler manners and more majestic virtues than
their degenerate descendants.  "Then," exclaimed Isocrates, "our young
men did not waste their days in the gambling-house, nor with
music-girls, nor in the assemblies, in which whole days are now consumed
then did they shun the Agora, or, if they passed through its haunts,
it was with modest and timorous forbearance&mdash;then, to contradict an
elder was a greater offence than nowadays to offend a parent&mdash;then,
not even a servant of honest repute would have been seen to eat or
drink within a tavern!"  "In the good old times," says the citizen of
Aristophanes <a href="#note-210" name="noteref-210"><small>210</small></a>, "our youths breasted the snow without a mantle&mdash;
their music was masculine and martial&mdash;their gymnastic exercises
decorous and chaste.  Thus were trained the heroes of Marathon!"
</p>
<p>
In such happy days we are informed that mendicancy and even want were
unknown. <a href="#note-211" name="noteref-211"><small>211</small></a>
</p>
<p>
It is scarcely necessary to observe, that we must accept these
comparisons between one age and another with considerable caution and
qualification.  We are too much accustomed to such declamations in our
own time not to recognise an ordinary trick of satirists and
declaimers.  As long as a people can bear patiently to hear their own
errors and follies scornfully proclaimed, they have not become
altogether degenerate or corrupt.  Yet still, making every allowance
for rhetorical or poetic exaggeration, it is not more evident than
natural that the luxury of civilization&mdash;the fervour of unbridled
competition, in pleasure as in toil&mdash;were attended with many changes
of manners and life favourable to art and intellect, but hostile to
the stern hardihood of a former age.
</p>
<p>
II.  But the change was commenced, not under a democracy, but under a
tyranny&mdash;it was consummated, not by the vices, but the virtues of the
nation.  It began with the Pisistratidae <a href="#note-212" name="noteref-212"><small>212</small></a>, who first introduced
into Athens the desire of pleasure and the habits of ostentation, that
refine before they enervate; and that luxury which, as in Athenaeus it
is well and profoundly said, is often the concomitant of freedom, "as
soft couches took their name from Hercules"&mdash;made its rapid progress
with the result of the Persian war.  The plunder of Plataea, the
luxuries of Byzantium, were not limited in their effect to the wild
Pausanias.  The decay of old and the rise of new families tended to
give a stimulus to the emulation of wealth&mdash;since it is by wealth that
new families seek to eclipse the old.  And even the destruction of
private houses, in the ravages of Mardonius, served to quicken the
career of art.  In rebuilding their mansions, the nobles naturally
availed themselves of the treasures and the appliances of the gorgeous
enemy they had vanquished and despoiled.  Few ever rebuild their
houses on as plain a scale as the old ones.  In the city itself the
residences of the great remained plain and simple; they were mostly
built of plaster and unburnt brick, and we are told that the houses of
Cimon and Pericles were scarcely distinguishable from those of the
other citizens.  But in their villas in Attica, in which the Athenians
took a passionate delight, they exhibited their taste and displayed
their wealth <a href="#note-213" name="noteref-213"><small>213</small></a>.  And the lucrative victories of Cimon, backed by
his own example of ostentation, gave to a vast number of families,
hitherto obscure, at once the power to gratify luxury and the desire
to parade refinement.  Nor was the Eastern example more productive of
emulation than the Ionian.  The Persian war, and the league which
followed it, brought Athens into the closest intercourse with her
graceful but voluptuous colonies.  Miletus fell, but the manners of
Miletus survived her liberties.  That city was renowned for the
peculiar grace and intellectual influence of its women; and it is
evident that there must have been a gradual change of domestic habits
and the formation of a new class of female society in Athens before
Aspasia could have summoned around her the power, and the wisdom, and
the wit of Athens&mdash;before an accomplished mistress could have been
even suspected of urging the politic Pericles into war&mdash;and, above
all, before an Athenian audience could have assented in delight to
that mighty innovation on their masculine drama&mdash;which is visible in
the passionate heroines and the sentimental pathos of Euripides.
</p>
<p>
But this change was probably not apparent in the Athenian matrons
themselves, who remained for the most part in primitive seclusion; and
though, I think, it will be shown hereafter that modern writers have
greatly exaggerated both the want of mental culture and the degree of
domestic confinement to which the Athenian women <a href="#note-214" name="noteref-214"><small>214</small></a> were subjected,
yet it is certain, at least, that they did not share the social
freedom or partake the intellectual accomplishments of their lords.
It was the new class of "Female Friends" or "Hetaerae," a phrase ill
translated by the name of "courtesans" (from whom they were
indubitably but not to our notions very intelligibly, distinguished),
that exhibited the rarest union of female blandishment and masculine
culture.  "The wife for our house and honour," implies Demosthenes,
"the Hetaera for our solace and delight."  These extraordinary women,
all foreigners, and mostly Ionian, made the main phenomenon of
Athenian society.  They were the only women with whom an enlightened
Greek could converse as equal to himself in education.  While the law
denied them civil rights, usage lavished upon them at once admiration
and respect.  By stealth, as it were, and in defiance of legislation,
they introduced into the ambitious and restless circles of Athens many
of the effects, pernicious or beneficial, which result from the
influence of educated women upon the manners and pursuits of men.
<a href="#note-215" name="noteref-215"><small>215</small></a>
</p>
<p>
III.  The alteration of social habits was not then sudden and
startling (such is never the case in the progress of national
manners), but, commencing with the graces of a polished tyranny,
ripened with the results of glorious but too profitable victories.
Perhaps the time in which the state of transition was most favourably
visible was just prior to the death of Cimon.  It was not then so much
the over-refinement of a new and feebler generation, as the polish and
elegance which wealth, art, and emulation necessarily imparted to the
same brave warriors who exchanged posts with the Spartans at Plataea,
and sent out their children and old men to fight and conquer with
Myronides.
</p>
<p>
IV.  A rapid glance over the events of the few years commemorated in
the last book of this history will suffice to show the eminence which
Athens had attained over the other states of Greece.  She was the head
of the Ionian League&mdash;the mistress of the Grecian seas; with Sparta,
the sole rival that could cope with her armies and arrest her
ambition, she had obtained a peace; Corinth was humbled, Aegina
ruined, Megara had shrunk into her dependency and garrison.  The
states of Boeotia had received their very constitution from the hands
of an Athenian general&mdash;the democracies planted by Athens served to
make liberty itself subservient to her will, and involved in her
safety.  She had remedied the sterility of her own soil by securing
the rich pastures of the neighbouring Euboea.  She had added the gold
of Thasos to the silver of Laurion, and established a footing in
Thessaly which was at once a fortress against the Asiatic arms and a
mart for Asiatic commerce.  The fairest lands of the opposite coast&mdash;
the most powerful islands of the Grecian seas&mdash;contributed to her
treasury, or were almost legally subjected to her revenge.  Her navy
was rapidly increasing in skill, in number, and renown; at home, the
recall of Cimon had conciliated domestic contentions, and the death of
Cimon dispirited for a while the foes to the established constitution.
In all Greece, Myronides was perhaps the ablest general&mdash;Pericles (now
rapidly rising to the sole administration of affairs <a href="#note-216" name="noteref-216"><small>216</small></a>) was
undoubtedly the most highly educated, cautious, and commanding
statesman.
</p>
<p>
But a single act of successful daring had, more than all else,
contributed to the Athenian power.  Even in the lifetime of Aristides
it had been proposed to transfer the common treasury from Delos to
Athens <a href="#note-217" name="noteref-217"><small>217</small></a>.  The motion failed&mdash;perhaps through the virtuous
opposition of Aristides himself.  But when at the siege of Ithome the
feud between the Athenians and Spartans broke out, the fairest pretext
and the most favourable occasion conspired in favour of a measure so
seductive to the national ambition.  Under pretence of saving the
treasury from the hazard of falling a prey to the Spartan rapacity or
need,&mdash;it was at once removed to Athens (B. C. 461 or 460) <a href="#note-218" name="noteref-218"><small>218</small></a>; and
while the enfeebled power of Sparta, fully engrossed by the Messenian
war, forbade all resistance to the transfer from that the most
formidable quarter, the conquests of Naxos and the recent reduction of
Thasos seem to have intimidated the spirit, and for a time even to
have silenced the reproaches, of the tributary states themselves.
Thus, in actual possession of the tribute of her allies, Athens
acquired a new right to its collection and its management; and while
she devoted some of the treasures to the maintenance of her strength,
she began early to uphold the prerogative of appropriating a part to
the enhancement of her splendour. <a href="#note-219" name="noteref-219"><small>219</small></a>
</p>
<p>
As this most important measure occurred at the very period when the
power of Cimon was weakened by the humiliating circumstances that
attended his expedition to Ithome, and by the vigorous and popular
measures of the opposition, so there seems every reason to believe
that it was principally advised and effected by Pericles, who appears
shortly afterward presiding over the administration of the finances.
<a href="#note-220" name="noteref-220"><small>220</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Though the Athenian commerce had greatly increased, it was still
principally confined to the Thracian coasts and the Black Sea.  The
desire of enterprises, too vast for a state whose power reverses might
suddenly destroy, was not yet indulged to excess; nor had the
turbulent spirits of the Piraeus yet poured in upon the various
barriers of the social state and the political constitution, the
rashness of sailors and the avarice of merchants.  Agriculture, to
which all classes in Athens were addicted, raised a healthful
counteraction to the impetus given to trade.  Nor was it till some
years afterward, when Pericles gathered all the citizens into the
town, and left no safety-valve to the ferment and vices of the Agora,
that the Athenian aristocracy gradually lost all patriotism and
manhood, and an energetic democracy was corrupted into a vehement
though educated mob.  The spirit of faction, it is true, ran high, but
a third party, headed by Myronides and Tolmides, checked the excesses
of either extreme.
</p>
<p>
V.  Thus, at home and abroad, time and fortune, the concurrence of
events, and the happy accident of great men, not only maintained the
present eminence of Athens, but promised, to ordinary foresight, a
long duration of her glory and her power.  To deeper observers, the
picture might have presented dim but prophetic shadows.  It was clear
that the command Athens had obtained was utterly disproportioned to
her natural resources&mdash;that her greatness was altogether artificial,
and rested partly upon moral rather than physical causes, and partly
upon the fears and the weakness of her neighbours.  A steril soil, a
limited territory, a scanty population&mdash;all these&mdash;the drawbacks and
disadvantages of nature&mdash;the wonderful energy and confident daring of
a free state might conceal in prosperity; but the first calamity could
not fail to expose them to jealous and hostile eyes.  The empire
delegated to the Athenians they must naturally desire to retain and to
increase; and there was every reason to forbode that their ambition
would soon exceed their capacities to sustain it.  As the state became
accustomed to its power, it would learn to abuse it.  Increasing
civilization, luxury, and art, brought with them new expenses, and
Athens had already been permitted to indulge with impunity the
dangerous passion of exacting tribute from her neighbours.  Dependance
upon other resources than those of the native population has ever been
a main cause of the destruction of despotisms, and it cannot fail,
sooner or later, to be equally pernicious to the republics that trust
to it.  The resources of taxation, confined to freemen and natives,
are almost incalculable; the resources of tribute, wrung from
foreigners and dependants, are sternly limited and terribly
precarious&mdash;they rot away the true spirit of industry in the people
that demand the impost&mdash;they implant ineradicable hatred in the states
that concede it.
</p>
<p>
VI.  Two other causes of great deterioration to the national spirit
were also at work in Athens.  One, as I have before hinted, was the
policy commenced by Cimon, of winning the populace by the bribes and
exhibitions of individual wealth.  The wise Pisistratus had invented
penalties&mdash;Cimon offered encouragement&mdash;to idleness.  When the poor
are once accustomed to believe they have a right to the generosity of
the rich, the first deadly inroad is made upon the energies of
independence and the sanctity of property.  A yet more pernicious evil
in the social state of the Athenians was radical in their
constitution&mdash;it was their courts of justice.  Proceeding upon a
theory that must have seemed specious and plausible to an
inexperienced and infant republic, Solon had laid it down as a
principle of his code, that as all men were interested in the
preservation of law, so all men might exert the privilege of the
plaintiff and accuser.  As society grew more complicated, the door was
thus opened to every species of vexatious charge and frivolous
litigation.  The common informer became a most harassing and powerful
personage, and made one of a fruitful and crowded profession; and in
the very capital of liberty there existed the worst species of
espionage.  But justice was not thereby facilitated.  The informer was
regarded with universal hatred and contempt; and it is easy to
perceive, from  the writings of the great comic poet, that the
sympathies of the Athenian audience were as those of the English
public at this day, enlisted against the man who brought the
inquisition of the law to the hearth of his neighbour.
</p>
<p>
VII.  Solon committed a yet more fatal and incurable error when he
carried the democratic principle into judicial tribunals.  He
evidently considered that the very strength and life of his
constitution rested in the Heliaea&mdash;a court the numbers and nature of
which have been already described.  Perhaps, at a time when the old
oligarchy was yet so formidable, it might have been difficult to
secure justice to the poorer classes while the judges were selected
from the wealthier.  But justice to all classes became a yet more
capricious uncertainty when a court of law resembled a popular
hustings. <a href="#note-221" name="noteref-221"><small>221</small></a>
</p>
<p>
If we intrust a wide political suffrage to the people, the people at
least hold no trust for others than themselves and their posterity&mdash;
they are not responsible to the public, for they are the public. But
in law, where there are two parties concerned, the plaintiff and
defendant, the judge should not only be incorruptible, but strictly
responsible.  In Athens the people became the judge; and, in offences
punishable by fine, were the very party interested in procuring
condemnation; the numbers of the jury prevented all responsibility,
excused all abuses, and made them susceptible of the same shameless
excesses that characterize self-elected corporations&mdash;from which
appeal is idle, and over which public opinion exercises no control.
These numerous, ignorant, and passionate assemblies were liable at all
times to the heats of party, to the eloquence of individuals&mdash;to the
whims and caprices, the prejudices, the impatience, and the turbulence
which must ever be the characteristics of a multitude orally
addressed.  It was evident, also, that from service in such a court,
the wealthy, the eminent, and the learned, with other occupation or
amusement, would soon seek to absent themselves.  And the final blow
to the integrity and respectability of the popular judicature was
given at a later period by Pericles, when he instituted a salary, just
sufficient to tempt the poor and to be disdained by the affluent, to
every dicast or juryman in the ten ordinary courts <a href="#note-222" name="noteref-222"><small>222</small></a>.  Legal
science became not the profession of the erudite and the laborious
few, but the livelihood of the ignorant and idle multitude.  The
canvassing&mdash;the cajoling&mdash;the bribery&mdash;that resulted from this, the
most vicious institution of the Athenian democracy&mdash;are but too
evident and melancholy tokens of the imperfection of human wisdom.
Life, property, and character were at the hazard of a popular
election.  These evils must have been long in progressive operation;
but perhaps they were scarcely visible till the fatal innovation of
Pericles, and the flagrant excesses that ensued allowed the people
themselves to listen to the branding and terrible satire upon the
popular judicature, which is still preserved to us in the comedy of
Aristophanes.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, certain critics and historians have widely and
grossly erred in supposing that these courts of "the sovereign
multitude" were partial to the poor and hostile to the rich.  All
testimony proves that the fact was lamentably the reverse.  The
defendant was accustomed to engage the persons of rank or influence
whom he might number as his friends, to appear in court on his behalf.
And property was employed to procure at the bar of justice the
suffrages it could command at a political election.  The greatest vice
of the democratic Heliaea was, that by a fine the wealthy could
purchase pardon&mdash;by interest the great could soften law.  But the
chances were against the poor man.  To him litigation was indeed
cheap, but justice dear.  He had much the same inequality to struggle
against in a suit with a powerful antagonist, that he would have had
in contesting with him for an office in the administration.  In all
trials resting on the voice of popular assemblies, it ever has been
and ever will be found, that, caeteris paribus, the aristocrat will
defeat the plebeian.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Meanwhile the progress of general education had been great and
remarkable.  Music <a href="#note-223" name="noteref-223"><small>223</small></a>, from the earliest time, was an essential
part of instruction; and it had now become so common an acquirement,
that Aristotle <a href="#note-224" name="noteref-224"><small>224</small></a> observes, that at the close of the Persian war
there was scarcely a single freeborn Athenian unacquainted with the
flute.  The use of this instrument was afterward discontinued, and
indeed proscribed in the education of freemen, from the notion that it
was not an instrument capable of music sufficiently elevated and
intellectual <a href="#note-225" name="noteref-225"><small>225</small></a>; yet it was only succeeded by melodies more
effeminate and luxurious.  And Aristophanes enumerates the change from
the old national airs and measures among the worst symptoms of
Athenian degeneracy.  Besides the musician, the tutor of the gymnasium
and the grammarian still made the nominal limit of scholastic
instruction. <a href="#note-226" name="noteref-226"><small>226</small></a>  But life itself had now become a school.  The
passion for public intercourse and disputation, which the gardens and
the Agora, and exciting events, and free institutions, and the rise of
philosophy, and a serene and lovely climate, made the prevalent
characteristic of the matured Athenian, began to stir within the
young.  And in the mean while the tardy invention of prose literature
worked its natural revolution in intellectual pursuits.
</p>
<p>
IX.  It has been before observed, that in Greece, as elsewhere, the
first successor of the poet was the philosopher, and that the oral
lecturer preceded the prose writer.  With written prose HISTORY
commenced.  Having found a mode of transmitting that species of
knowledge which could not, like rhythmical tales or sententious
problems, be accurately preserved by the memory alone, it was natural
that a present age should desire to record and transmit the past&mdash;
chtaema es aei&mdash;an everlasting heirloom to the future.
</p>
<p>
To a semi-barbarous nation history is little more than poetry.  The
subjects to which it would be naturally devoted are the legends of
religion&mdash;the deeds of ancestral demigods&mdash;the triumphs of successful
war.  In recording these themes of national interest, the poet is the
first historian.  As philosophy&mdash;or rather the spirit of conjecture,
which is the primitive and creative breath of philosophy&mdash;becomes
prevalent, the old credulity directs the new research to the
investigation of subjects which the poets have not sufficiently
explained, but which, from their remote and religious antiquity, are
mysteriously attractive to a reverent and inquisitive population, with
whom long descent is yet the most flattering proof of superiority.
Thus genealogies, and accounts of the origin of states and deities,
made the first subjects of history, and inspired the Argive Acusilaus
<a href="#note-227" name="noteref-227"><small>227</small></a>, and, as far as we can plausibly conjecture, the Milesian
Cadmus.
</p>
<p>
X.  The Dorians&mdash;a people who never desired to disturb tradition,
unwilling carefully to investigate, precisely because they
superstitiously venerated, the past, little inquisitive as to the
manners or the chronicles of alien tribes, satisfied, in a word, with
themselves, and incurious as to others&mdash;were not a race to whom
history became a want.  Ionia&mdash;the subtle, the innovating, the
anxious, and the restless&mdash;nurse of the arts, which the mother country
ultimately reared, boasts in Cadmus the Milesian the first writer of
history and of prose <a href="#note-228" name="noteref-228"><small>228</small></a>; Samos, the birthplace of Pythagoras,
produced Eugeon, placed by Dionysius at the head of the early
historians; and Mitylene claimed Hellanicus, who seems to have formed
a more ambitious design than his predecessors.  He wrote a history of
the ancient kings of the earth, and an account of the founders of the
most celebrated cities in each kingdom <a href="#note-229" name="noteref-229"><small>229</small></a>.  During the early and
crude attempts of these and other writers, stern events contributed to
rear from tedious research and fruitless conjecture the true genius of
history; for it is as a people begin to struggle for rights, to
comprehend political relations, to contend with neighbours abroad, and
to wrestle with obnoxious institutions at home, that they desire to
secure the sanction of antiquity, to trace back to some illustrious
origin the rights they demand, and to stimulate hourly exertions by a
reference to departed fame.  Then do mythologies, and genealogies, and
geographical definitions, and the traditions that concern kings and
heroes, ripen into chronicles that commemorate the convulsions or the
progress of a nation.
</p>
<p>
During the stormy period which saw the invasion of Xerxes (B. C. 480),
when everything that could shed lustre upon the past incited to
present struggles, flourished Pherecydes.  He is sometimes called of
Leria, which seems his birthplace&mdash;sometimes of Athens, where he
resided thirty years, and to which state his history refers.  Although
his work was principally mythological, it opened the way to sound
historical composition, inasmuch as it included references to later
times&mdash;to existent struggles&mdash;the descent of Miltiades&mdash;the Scythian
expedition of Darius.  Subsequently, Xanthus, a Lydian, composed a
work on his own country (B. C. 463), of which some extracts remain,
and from which Herodotus did not disdain to borrow.
</p>
<p>
XI.  It was nearly a century after the invention of prose and of
historical composition, and with the guides and examples of, many
writers not uncelebrated in their day before his emulation, that
Herodotus first made known to the Grecian public, and, according to
all probable evidence, at the Olympic Games, a portion of that work
which drew forth the tears of Thucydides, and furnishes the
imperishable model of picturesque and faithful narrative.  This
happened in a brilliant period of Athenian history; it was in the same
year as the battle of Oenophyta, when Athens gave laws and
constitutions to Boeotia, and the recall of Cimon established for
herself both liberty and order.  The youth of Herodotus was passed
while the glory of the Persian war yet lingered over Greece, and while
with the ascendency of Athens commenced a new era of civilization.
His genius drew the vital breath from an atmosphere of poetry.  The
desire of wild adventure still existed, and the romantic expedition of
the Athenians into Egypt had served to strengthen the connexion
between the Greeks and that imposing and interesting land.  The rise
of the Greek drama with Aeschylus probably contributed to give effect,
colour, and vigour to the style of Herodotus.  And something almost of
the art of the contemporaneous Sophocles may be traced in the easy
skill of his narratives, and the magic yet tranquil energy of his
descriptions.
</p>
<p>
XII.  Though Dorian by ancient descent, it was at Halicarnassus, in
Caria, a city of Asia Minor, that Herodotus was born; nor does his
style, nor do his views, indicate that he derived from the origin of
his family any of the Dorian peculiarities.  His parents were
distinguished alike by birth and fortune.  Early in life those
internal commotions, to which all the Grecian towns were subjected,
and which crushed for a time the liberties of his native city, drove
him from Halicarnassus: and, suffering from tyranny, he became
inspired by that enthusiasm for freedom which burns throughout his
immortal work.  During his exile he travelled through Greece, Thrace,
and Macedonia&mdash;through Scythia, Asia, and Egypt.  Thus he collected
the materials of his work, which is, in fact, a book of travels
narrated historically.  If we do not reject the story that he read a
portion of his work at the Olympian Games, when Thucydides, one of his
listeners, was yet a boy, and if we suppose the latter to have been
about fifteen, this anecdote is calculated <a href="#note-230" name="noteref-230"><small>230</small></a> to bear the date of
Olym. 81, B. C. 456, when Herodotus was twenty-eight.
</p>
<p>
The chief residence of Herodotus was at Samos, until a revolution
broke out in Halicarnassus.  The people conspired against their tyrant
Lygdamis.  Herodotus repaired to his native city, took a prominent
part in the conspiracy, and finally succeeded in restoring the popular
government.  He was not, however, long left to enjoy the liberties he
had assisted to acquire for his fellow-citizens: some intrigue of the
counter-party drove him a second time into exile.  Repairing to
Athens, he read the continuation of his history at the festival of the
Panathenaea (B. C. 446).  It was received with the most rapturous
applause; and we are told that the people solemnly conferred upon the
man who had immortalized their achievements against the Mede the gift
of ten talents.  The disposition of this remarkable man, like that of
all travellers, inclined to enterprise and adventure.  His early
wanderings, his later vicissitudes, seem to have confirmed a
temperament originally restless and inquisitive.  Accordingly, in his
forty-first year, he joined the Athenian emigrators that in the south
of Italy established a colony at Thurium (B. C. 443).
</p>
<p>
VIII.  At Thurium Herodotus apparently passed the remainder of his
life, though whether his tomb was built there or in Athens is a matter
of dispute.  These particulars of his life, not uninteresting in
themselves, tend greatly to illustrate the character of his writings.
Their charm consists in the earnestness of a man who describes
countries as an eyewitness, and events as one accustomed to
participate in them.  The life, the raciness, the vigour of an
adventurer and a wanderer glow in every page.  He has none of the
refining disquisitions that are born of the closet.  He paints history
rather than descants on it; he throws the colourings of a mind,
unconsciously poetic, over all he describes.  Now a soldier&mdash;now a
priest&mdash;now a patriot&mdash;he is always a poet, if rarely a philosopher.
He narrates like a witness, unlike Thucydides, who sums up like a
judge.  No writer ever made so beautiful an application of
superstitions to truths.  His very credulities have a philosophy of
their own; and modern historians have acted unwisely in disdaining the
occasional repetition even of his fables.  For if his truths record
the events, his fables paint the manners and the opinions of the time;
and the last fill up the history, of which events are only the
skeleton.
</p>
<p>
To account for his frequent use of dialogue and his dramatic effects
of narrative, we must remember the tribunal to which the work of
Herodotus was subjected.  Every author, unconsciously to himself,
consults the tastes of those he addresses.  No small coterie of
scholars, no scrupulous and critical inquirers, made the ordeal
Herodotus underwent.  His chronicles were not dissertations to be
coldly pondered over and skeptically conned: they were read aloud at
solemn festivals to listening thousands; they were to arrest the
curiosity&mdash;to amuse the impatience&mdash;to stir the wonder of a lively and
motley crowd.  Thus the historian imbibed naturally the spirit of the
taleteller.  And he was driven to embellish his history with the
romantic legend&mdash;the awful superstition&mdash;the gossip anecdote&mdash;which
yet characterize the stories of the popular and oral fictionist, in
the bazars of the Mussulman, or on the seasands of Sicily.  Still it
has been rightly said that a judicious reader is not easily led astray
by Herodotus in important particulars.  His descriptions of
localities, of manners and customs, are singularly correct; and modern
travellers can yet trace the vestiges of his fidelity.  As the
historian, therefore, was in some measure an orator, so his skill was
to be manifest in the arts which keep alive the attention of an
audience.  Hence Herodotus continually aims at the picturesque; he
gives us the very words of his actors, and narrates the secrets of
impenetrable palaces with as much simplicity and earnestness as if he
had been placed behind the arras. <a href="#note-231" name="noteref-231"><small>231</small></a>
</p>
<p>
That it was impossible for the wandering Halicarnassian to know what
Gyges said to Candaules, or Artabanus to Xerxes, has, perhaps, been
too confidently asserted.  Heeren reminds us, that both by Jewish and
Grecian writers there is frequent mention of the scribes or
secretaries who constantly attended the person of the Persian monarch
&mdash;on occasion of festivals <a href="#note-232" name="noteref-232"><small>232</small></a>, of public reviews <a href="#note-233" name="noteref-233"><small>233</small></a>, and even in
the tumult of battle; and, with the idolatrous respect in which
despotism was held, noted down the words that fell from the royal lip.
The ingenious German then proceeds to show that this custom was common
to all the Asiatic nations.  Thus were formed the chronicles or
archives of the Persians; and by reference to these minute and
detailed documents, Herodotus was enabled to record conversations and
anecdotes, and preserve to us the memoirs of a court.  And though this
conjecture must be received with caution, and, to many passages
unconnected with Persia or the East, cannot be applied, it is
sufficiently plausible, in some very important parts of the history,
not to be altogether dismissed with contempt.
</p>
<p>
But it is for another reason that I have occasionally admitted the
dialogues of Herodotus, as well as the superstitious anecdotes current
at the day.  The truth of history consists not only in the relation of
events, but in preserving the character of the people, and depicting
the manners of the time.  Facts, if too nakedly told, may be very
different from truths, in the impression they convey; and the spirit
of Grecian history is lost if we do not feel the Greeks themselves
constantly before us.  Thus when, as in Herodotus, the agents of
events converse, every word reported may not have been spoken; but
what we lose in accuracy of details we more than gain by the fidelity
of the whole.  We acquire a lively and accurate impression of the
general character&mdash;of the thoughts, and the manners, and the men of
the age and the land.  It is so also with legends, sparingly used, and
of which the nature is discernible from fact by the most superficial
gaze; we more sensibly feel that it was the Greeks who were engaged at
Marathon when we read of the dream of Hippias or the apparition of
Theseus.  Finally, an historian of Greece will, almost without an
effort, convey to the reader a sense of the mighty change, from an age
of poetical heroes to an age of practical statesmen, if we suffer
Herodotus to be his model in the narrative of the Persian war, and
allow the more profound and less imaginative Thucydides to colour the
pictures of the Peloponnesian.
</p>
<p>
XIV.  The period now entered upon is also remarkable for the fertile
and rapid development of one branch of intellectual cultivation in
which the Greeks were pre-eminently illustrious.  In history, Rome was
the rival of Greece; in philosophy, Rome was never more than her
credulous and reverend scholar.
</p>
<p>
We have seen the dawn of philosophy with Thales; Miletus, his
birthplace, bore his immediate successors.  Anaximander, his younger
contemporary <a href="#note-234" name="noteref-234"><small>234</small></a>, is said, with Pherecydes, to have been the first
philosopher who availed himself of the invention of writing.  His
services have not been sufficiently appreciated&mdash;like those of most
men who form the first steps in the progress between the originator
and the perfector.  He seems boldly to have differed from his master,
Thales, in the very root of his system.  He rejected the original
element of water or humidity, and supposed the great primary essence
and origin of creation to be in that EVERYTHING or NOTHING which he
called THE INFINITE, and which we might perhaps render as "The Chaos;"
<a href="#note-235" name="noteref-235"><small>235</small></a> that of this vast element, the parts are changed&mdash;the whole
immutable, and all things arise from and return unto that universal
source <a href="#note-236" name="noteref-236"><small>236</small></a>.  He pursued his researches into physics, and attempted
to account for the thunder, the lightning, and the winds.  His
conjectures are usually shrewd and keen; and sometimes, as in his
assertion, "that the moon shone in light borrowed from the sun," may
deserve a higher praise.  Both Anaximander and Pherecydes concurred in
the principles of their doctrines, but the latter seems to have more
distinctly asserted the immortality of the soul. <a href="#note-237" name="noteref-237"><small>237</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Anaximenes, also of Miletus, was the friend and follower of
Anaximander (B. C. 548).  He seems, however, to have deserted the
abstract philosophical dogmas of his tutor, and to have resumed the
analogical system commenced by Thales&mdash;like that philosopher, he
founded axioms upon observations, bold and acute, but partial and
contracted.  He maintained that air was the primitive element.  In
this theory he united the Zeus, or ether, of Pherecydes, and the
Infinite of Anaximander, for he held the air to be God in itself, and
infinite in its nature.
</p>
<p>
XV.  While these wild but ingenious speculators conducted the career
of that philosophy called the Ionian, to the later time of the serene
and lofty spiritualism of Anaxagoras, two new schools arose, both
founded by Ionians, but distinguished by separate names&mdash;the Eleatic
and the Italic.  The first was founded by Xenophanes of Colophon, in
Elea, a town in western Italy.  Migrating to an alien shore,
colonization seems to have produced in philosophy the same results
which it produced in politics: it emancipated the reason from all
previous prejudice and prescriptive shackles.  Xenophanes was the
first thinker who openly assailed the popular faith (B. C. 538).  He
divested the Great Deity of the human attributes which human vanity,
assimilating God to man, had bestowed upon him.  The divinity of
Xenophanes is that of modern philosophy&mdash;eternal, unalterable, and
alone: graven images cannot represent his form.  His attributes are&mdash;
ALL HEARING, ALL SIGHT, and ALL THOUGHT.
</p>
<p>
To the Eleatic school, founded by Xenophanes, belong Parmenides,
Melissus the Samian, Zeno, and Heraclitus of Ephesus.  All these were
thinkers remarkable for courage and subtlety.  The main metaphysical
doctrines of this school approach, in many respects, to those that
have been familiar to modern speculators.  Their predecessors argued,
as the basis of their system, from experience of the outward world,
and the evidence of the senses; the Eleatic school, on the contrary,
commenced their system from the reality of ideas, and thence argued on
the reality of external objects; experience with them was but a show
and an appearance; knowledge was not in things without, but in the
mind; they were the founders of idealism.  With respect to the Deity,
they imagined the whole universe filled with it&mdash;God was ALL IN ALL.
Such, though each philosopher varied the system in detail, were the
main metaphysical dogmas of the Eleatic school.  Its masters were
high-wrought, subtle, and religious thinkers; but their doctrines were
based upon a theory that necessarily led to parodox and mysticism; and
finally conduced to the most dangerous of all the ancient sects&mdash;that
of the sophists.
</p>
<p>
We may here observe, that the spirit of poetry long continued to
breathe in the forms of philosophy.  Even Anaximander, and his
immediate followers in the Ionic school, while writing in prose,
appear, from a few fragments left to us, to have had much recourse to
poetical expression, and often convey a dogma by an image; while, in
the Eleatic school, Xenophanes and Parmenides adopted the form itself
of verse, as the medium for communicating their theories; and Zeno,
perhaps from the new example of the drama, first introduced into
philosophical dispute that fashion of dialogue which afterward gave to
the sternest and loftiest thought the animation and life of dramatic
pictures.
</p>
<p>
XVI.  But even before the Eleatic school arose, the most remarkable
and ambitious of all the earlier reasoners, the arch uniter of actual
politics with enthusiastic reveries&mdash;the hero of a thousand legends&mdash;a
demigod in his ends and an impostor in his means&mdash;Pythagoras of Samos
&mdash;conceived and partially executed the vast design of establishing a
speculative wisdom and an occult religion as the keystone of political
institutions.
</p>
<p>
So mysterious is everything relating to Pythagoras, so mingled with
the grossest fables and the wildest superstitions, that he seems
scarcely to belong to the age of history, or to the advanced and
practical Ionia.  The date of his birth&mdash;his very parentage, are
matters of dispute and doubt.  Accounts concur in considering his
father not a native of Samos; and it seems a probable supposition that
he was of Lemnian or Pelasgic origin.  Pythagoras travelled early into
Egypt and the East, and the system most plausibly ascribed to him
betrays something of oriental mystery and priestcraft in its peculiar
doctrines, and much more of those alien elements in its pervading and
general spirit.  The notion of uniting a state with religion is
especially Eastern, and essentially anti-Hellenic.  Returning to
Samos, he is said to have found the able Polycrates in the tyranny of
the government, and to have quitted his birthplace in disgust.  If,
then, he had already conceived his political designs, it is clear that
they could never have been executed under a jealous and acute tyrant;
for, in the first place, radical innovations are never so effectually
opposed as in governments concentrated in the hands of a single man;
and, secondly, the very pith and core of the system of Pythagoras
consisted in the establishment of an oligarchic aristocracy&mdash;a
constitution most hated and most persecuted by the Grecian tyrants.
The philosopher migrated into Italy.  He had already, in all
probability, made himself renowned in Greece.  For it was then a
distinction to have travelled into Egypt, the seat of mysterious and
venerated learning; and philosophy, like other novelties, appears to
have passed into fashion even with the multitude.  Not only all the
traditions respecting this extraordinary man, but the certain fact of
the mighty effect that, in his single person, he afterward wrought in
Italy, prove him also to have possessed that nameless art of making a
personal impression upon mankind, and creating individual enthusiasm,
which is necessary to those who obtain a moral command, and are the
founders of sects and institutions.  It is so much in conformity with
the manners of the time and the objects of Pythagoras to believe that
he diligently explored the ancient, religions and political systems of
Greece, from which he had long been a stranger, that we cannot reject
the traditions (however disfigured with fable) that he visited Delos,
and affected to receive instructions from the pious ministrants of
Delphi. <a href="#note-238" name="noteref-238"><small>238</small></a>
</p>
<p>
At Olympia, where he could not fail to be received with curiosity and
distinction, the future lawgiver is said to have assumed the title of
philosopher, the first who claimed the name.  For the rest, we must
yield our faith to all probable accounts, both of his own earnest
preparations for his design, and of the high repute he acquired in
Greece, that may tend to lessen the miracle of the success that
awaited him in the cities of the west.
</p>
<p>
XVII.  Pythagoras (B. C. 540-510) arrived in Italy during the reign of
Tarquinius Superbus, according to the testimony of Cicero and Aulus
Gellius <a href="#note-239" name="noteref-239"><small>239</small></a>, and fixed his residence in Croton, a city in the Bay of
Tarentum, colonized by Greeks of the Achaean tribe <a href="#note-240" name="noteref-240"><small>240</small></a>.  If we may
lend a partial credit to the extravagant fables of later disciples,
endeavouring to extract from florid superaddition some original germe
of simple truth, it would seem that he first appeared in the character
of a teacher of youth <a href="#note-241" name="noteref-241"><small>241</small></a>; and, as was not unusual in those times,
soon rose from the preceptor to the legislator.  Dissensions in the
city favoured his objects.  The senate (consisting of a thousand
members, doubtless of a different race from the body of the people;
the first the posterity of the settlers, the last the native
population) availed itself of the arrival and influence of an eloquent
and renowned philosopher.  He lent himself to the consolidation of
aristocracies, and was equally inimical to democracy and tyranny.  But
his policy was that of no vulgar ambition; he refused, at least for a
time, ostensible power and office, and was contented with instituting
an organized and formidable society&mdash;not wholly dissimilar to that
mighty order founded by Loyola in times comparatively recent.  The
disciples admitted into this society underwent examination and
probation; it was through degrees that they passed into its higher
honours, and were admitted into its deepest secrets.  Religion made
the basis of the fraternity&mdash;but religion connected with human ends of
advancement and power.  He selected the three hundred who, at Croton,
formed his order, from the noblest families, and they were professedly
reared to know themselves, that so they might be fitted to command the
world.  It was not long before this society, of which Pythagoras was
the head, appears to have supplanted the ancient senate and obtained
the legislative administration.  In this institution, Pythagoras
stands alone&mdash;no other founder of Greek philosophy resembles him.  By
all accounts, he also differed from the other sages of his time in his
estimate of the importance of women.  He is said to have lectured to
and taught them.  His wife was herself a philosopher, and fifteen
disciples of the softer sex rank among the prominent ornaments of his
school.  An order based upon so profound a knowledge of all that can
fascinate or cheat mankind, could not fail to secure a temporary
power.  His influence was unbounded in Croton&mdash;it extended to other
Italian cities&mdash;it amended or overturned political constitutions; and
had Pythagoras possessed a more coarse and personal ambition, he
might, perhaps, have founded a mighty dynasty, and enriched our social
annals with the results of a new experiment.  But his was the
ambition, not of a hero, but a sage.  He wished rather to establish a
system than to exalt himself; his immediate followers saw not all the
consequences that might be derived from the fraternity he founded: and
the political designs of his gorgeous and august philosophy, only for
a while successful, left behind them but the mummeries of an impotent
freemasonry and the enthusiastic ceremonies of half-witted ascetics.
</p>
<p>
XVIII.  It was when this power, so mystic and so revolutionary, had,
by the means of branch societies, established itself throughout a
considerable portion of Italy, that a general feeling of alarm and
suspicion broke out against the sage and his sectarians.  The
anti-Pythagorean risings, according to Porphyry, were sufficiently
numerous and active to be remembered for long generations afterward.
Many of the sage's friends are said to have perished, and it is doubtful
whether Pythagoras himself fell a victim to the rage of his enemies, or
died a fugitive among his disciples at Metapontum.  Nor was it until
nearly the whole of Lower Italy was torn by convulsions, and Greece
herself drawn into the contest, as pacificator and arbiter, that the
ferment was allayed&mdash;the Pythagorean institutions were abolished, and
the timocratic democracies <a href="#note-242" name="noteref-242"><small>242</small></a> of the Achaeans rose upon the ruins of
those intellectual but ungenial oligarchies.
</p>
<p>
XIX.  Pythagoras committed a fatal error when, in his attempt to
revolutionize society, he had recourse to aristocracies for his
agents.  Revolutions, especially those influenced by religion, can
never be worked out but by popular emotions.  It was from this error
of judgment that he enlisted the people against him&mdash;for, by the
account of Neanthes, related by Porphyry <a href="#note-243" name="noteref-243"><small>243</small></a>, and, indeed, from all
other testimony, it is clearly evident that to popular, not party
commotion, his fall must be ascribed.  It is no less clear that, after
his death, while his philosophical sect remained, his political code
crumbled away.  The only seeds sown by philosophers, which spring up
into great states, are those that, whether for good or evil, are
planted in the hearts of the many.
</p>
<p>
XX.  The purely intellectual additions made by Pythagoras to human
wisdom seem to have been vast and permanent.  By probable testimony,
he added largely to mathematical science; and his discoveries in
arithmetic, astronomy, music, and geometry, constitute an era in the
history of the mind.  His metaphysical and moral speculations are not
to be separated from the additions or corruptions of his disciples.
But we must at least suppose that Pythagoras established the main
proposition of the occult properties of NUMBERS, which were held to be
the principles of all things.  According to this theory, unity is the
abstract principle of all perfection, and the ten elementary numbers
contain the elements of the perfect system of nature.  By numbers the
origin and the substance of all things could be explained <a href="#note-244" name="noteref-244"><small>244</small></a>.
Numbers make the mystery of earth and heaven&mdash;of the gods themselves.
And this part of his system, which long continued to fool mankind, was
a sort of monstrous junction between arithmetic and magic&mdash;the most
certain of sciences with the most fantastic of chimeras.  The
Pythagoreans supposed the sun, or central fire, to be the seat of
Jupiter and the principle of life.  The stars were divine.  Men, and
even animals, were held to have within them a portion of the celestial
nature.  The soul, emanating from the celestial fire <a href="#note-245" name="noteref-245"><small>245</small></a>&mdash;can
combine with any form of matter, and is compelled to pass through
various bodies.  Adopting the Egyptian doctrine of transmigration, the
Pythagoreans coupled it with the notion of future punishment or
reward.
</p>
<p>
Much of the doctrinal morality of Pythagoras is admirable; but it is
vitiated by the ceremonial quackery connected with it.  Humanity to
all things&mdash;gentleness&mdash;friendship&mdash;love&mdash;and, above all the rest,
SELF-COMMAND&mdash;form the principal recommendations of his mild and
patriarchal ethics.  But, perhaps, from his desire to establish a
political fraternity&mdash;perhaps from his doubt of the capacity of
mankind to embrace Truth unadorned, enamoured only of her own beauty&mdash;
these doctrines were united with an austere and frivolous ascetism.
And virtue was but to be attained by graduating through the secret and
rigid ceremonies of academical imposture.  His disciples soon pushed
the dogmas of their master into an extravagance at once dangerous and
grotesque; and what the sage designed but for symbols of a truth were
cultivated to the prejudice of the truth itself.  The influence of
Pythagoras became corrupt and pernicious in proportion as the original
tenets became more and more adulterated or obscure, and served, in
succeeding ages, to invest with the sanctity of a great name the most
visionary chimeras and the most mischievous wanderings of perverted
speculation.  But, looking to the man himself&mdash;his discoveries&mdash;his
designs&mdash;his genius&mdash;his marvellous accomplishments&mdash;we cannot but
consider him as one of the most astonishing persons the world ever
produced; and, if in part a mountebank and an impostor, no one,
perhaps, ever deluded others with motives more pure&mdash;from an ambition
more disinterested and benevolent.
</p>
<p>
XXI.  Upon the Athenians the effect of these various philosophers was
already marked and influential.  From the time of Solon there had
existed in Athens a kind of school of political philosophy <a href="#note-246" name="noteref-246"><small>246</small></a>.  But
it was not a school of refining dogmas or systematic ethics; it was
too much connected with daily and practical life to foster to any
great extent the abstract contemplations and recondite theories of
metaphysical discoveries.  Mnesiphilus, the most eminent of these
immediate successors of Solon, was the instructor of Themistocles, the
very antipodes of rhetoricians and refiners.  But now a new age of
philosophy was at hand.  Already the Eleatic sages, Zeno and
Parmenides, had travelled to Athens, and there proclaimed their
doctrines, and Zeno numbered among his listeners and disciples the
youthful Pericles.  But a far more sensible influence was exercised by
Anaxagoras of the Ionian school.  For thirty years, viz., from B. C.
480 to B. C. 450, during that eventful and stirring period intervening
between the battle of Thermopylae and the commencement of the five
years' truce with Sparta, followed by the death of Cimon (B. C. 449),
this eminent and most accomplished reasoner resided in Athens <a href="#note-247" name="noteref-247"><small>247</small></a>.
His doctrines were those most cherished by Pericles, who ranked the
philosopher among his intimate friends.  After an absence of some
years, he again returned to Athens; and we shall then find him
subjected to a prosecution in which religious prejudice was stimulated
by party feud.  More addicted to physics than to metaphysical
research, he alarmed the national superstition by explaining on
physical principles the formation even of the celestial bodies.
According to him, the sun itself&mdash;that centre of divine perfection
with the Pythagoreans&mdash;was ejected from the earth and heated into fire
by rapid motion.  He maintained that the proper study of man was the
contemplation of nature and the heavens <a href="#note-248" name="noteref-248"><small>248</small></a>: and he refined the
Author of the universe into an intellectual principle (Nous), which
went to the root of the material causes mostly favoured by his
predecessors and contemporaries.  He admitted the existence of matter,
but INTELLIGENCE was the animating and prevailing principle, creating
symmetry from chaos, imposing limit and law on all things, and
inspiring life, and sensation, and perception.  His predecessors in
the Ionian school, who left the universe full of gods, had not openly
attacked the popular mythology.  But the assertion of One
Intelligence, and the reduction of all else to material and physical
causes, could not but have breathed a spirit wholly inimical to the
numerous and active deities of Hellenic worship.  Party feeling
against his friend and patron Pericles ultimately drew the general
suspicion into a focus; and Anaxagoras was compelled to quit Athens,
and passed the remainder of his days at Lampsacus.  But his influence
survived his exile.  His pupil Archelaus was the first <i>native
Athenian</i> who taught philosophy at Athens (B. C. 450), and from him we
date the foundation of those brilliant and imperishable schools which
secured to Athens an intellectual empire long after her political
independence had died away <a href="#note-249" name="noteref-249"><small>249</small></a>.  Archelaus himself (as was the usual
custom of the earlier sages) departed widely from the tenets of his
master.  He supposed that two discordant principles, fire and water,
had, by their operation, drawn all things from chaos into order, and
his metaphysics were those of unalloyed materialism.  At this period,
too, or a little later, began slowly to arise in Athens the sect of
the Sophists, concerning whom so much has been written and so little
is known.  But as the effects of their lessons were not for some time
widely apparent, it will be more in the order of this history to defer
to a later era an examination of the doctrines of that perverted but
not wholly pernicious school.
</p>
<p>
XXII.  Enough has been now said to convey to the reader a general
notion of the prodigious rise which, in the most serene of
intellectual departments, had been made in Greece, from the appearance
of Solon to the lectures of Archelaus, who was the master of Socrates.
With the Athenians philosophy was not a thing apart from the
occupations of life and the events of history&mdash;it was not the monopoly
of a few studious minds, but was cultivated as a fashion by the young
and the well-born, the statesman, the poet, the man of pleasure, the
votary of ambition <a href="#note-250" name="noteref-250"><small>250</small></a>.  It was inseparably interwoven with their
manners, their pursuits, their glory, their decay.  The history of
Athens includes in itself the history of the human mind.  Science and
art&mdash;erudition and genius&mdash;all conspired&mdash;no less than the trophies of
Miltiades, the ambition of Alcibiades&mdash;the jealousy of Sparta&mdash;to the
causes of the rise and fall of Athens.  And even that satire on
themselves, to which, in the immortal lampoons of Aristophanes, the
Athenian populace listened, exhibits a people whom, whatever their
errors, the world never can see again&mdash;with whom philosophy was a
pastime&mdash;with whom the Agora itself was an academe&mdash;whose coarsest
exhibitions of buffoonery and caricature sparkle with a wit, or expand
into a poetry, which attest the cultivation of the audience no less
than the genius of the author; a people, in a word, whom the stagirite
unconsciously individualized when he laid down a general proposition,
which nowhere else can be received as a truism&mdash;that the common people
are the most exquisite judges of whatever in art is graceful,
harmonious, or sublime.

</p>
<p>
I.  On the death of Cimon (B. C. 449) the aristocratic party in Athens
felt that the position of their antagonists and the temper of the
times required a leader of abilities widely distinct from those which
had characterized the son of Miltiades.  Instead of a skilful and
enterprising general, often absent from the city on dazzling but
distant expeditions, it was necessary to raise up a chief who could
contend for their enfeebled and disputed privileges at home, and meet
the formidable Pericles, with no unequal advantages of civil
experience and oratorical talent, in the lists of the popular
assembly, or in the stratagems of political intrigue.  Accordingly
their choice fell neither on Myronides nor Tolmides, but on one who,
though not highly celebrated for military exploits, was deemed
superior to Cimon, whether as a practical statesman or a popular
orator.  Thucydides, their new champion, united with natural gifts
whatever advantage might result from the memory of Cimon; and his
connexion with that distinguished warrior, to whom he was
brother-in-law, served to keep together the various partisans of the
faction, and retain to the eupatrids something of the respect and
enthusiasm which the services of Cimon could not fail to command, even
among the democracy.  The policy embraced by Thucydides was perhaps the
best which the state of affairs would permit; but it was one which was
fraught with much danger.  Hitherto the eupatrids and the people, though
ever in dispute, had not been absolutely and totally divided; the
struggles of either faction being headed by nobles, scarcely permitted
to the democracy the perilous advantage of the cry&mdash;that the people were
on one side, and the nobles on the other.  But Thucydides, seeking to
render his party as strong, as compact, and as united as possible,
brought the main bulk of the eupatrids to act together in one body.  The
means by which he pursued and attained this object are not very clearly
narrated; but it was probably by the formation of a political club&mdash;a
species of social combination, which afterward became very common to all
classes in Athens.  The first effect of this policy favoured the
aristocracy, and the energy and union they displayed restored for a
while the equilibrium of parties; but the aristocratic influence, thus
made clear and open, and brought into avowed hostility with the popular
cause, the city was rent in two, and the community were plainly invited
to regard the nobles as their foes <a href="#note-251" name="noteref-251"><small>251</small></a>.  Pericles, thus more and more
thrown upon the democracy, became identified with their interests, and
he sought, no less by taste than policy, to prove to the populace that
they had grown up into a wealthy and splendid nation, that could
dispense with the bounty, the shows, and the exhibitions of individual
nobles.  He lavished the superfluous treasures of the state upon public
festivals, stately processions, and theatrical pageants.  As if desirous
of elevating the commons to be themselves a nobility, all by which he
appealed to their favour served to refine their taste and to inspire the
meanest Athenian with a sense of the Athenian grandeur.  It was said by
his enemies, and the old tale has been credulously repeated, that his
own private fortune not allowing him to vie with the wealthy nobles whom
he opposed, it was to supply his deficiencies from the public stock that
he directed some part of the national wealth to the encouragement of the
national arts and the display of the national magnificence.  But it is
more than probable that it was rather from principle than personal
ambition that Pericles desired to discountenance and eclipse the
interested bribes to public favour with which Cimon and others had
sought to corrupt the populace.  Nor was Pericles without the means or
the spirit to devote his private fortune to proper objects of
generosity.  "It was his wealth and his prudence," says Plutarch, when,
blaming the improvidence of Anaxagoras, "that enabled him to relieve the
distressed."  What he spent in charity he might perhaps have spent more
profitably in display, had he not conceived that charity was the
province of the citizen, magnificence the privilege of the state.  It
was in perfect consonance with the philosophy that now began to spread
throughout Greece, and with which the mind of this great political
artist was so deeply imbued, to consider that the graces ennobled the
city they adorned, and that the glory of a state was intimately
connected with the polish of the people.
</p>
<p>
II.  While, at home, the divisions of the state were progressing to
that point in which the struggle between the opposing leaders must
finally terminate in the ordeal of the ostracism&mdash;abroad, new causes
of hostility broke out between the Athenians and the Spartans.  The
sacred city of Delphi formed a part of the Phocian station; but, from
a remote period, its citizens appear to have exercised the independent
right of managing to affairs of the temple <a href="#note-252" name="noteref-252"><small>252</small></a>, and to have elected
their own superintendents of the oracle and the treasures.  In Delphi
yet lingered the trace of the Dorian institutions and the Dorian
blood, but the primitive valour and hardy virtues of the ancestral
tribe had long since mouldered away.  The promiscuous intercourse of
strangers, the contaminating influence of unrelaxing imposture and
priestcraft&mdash;above all, the wealth of the city, from which the natives
drew subsistence, and even luxury, without labour <a href="#note-253" name="noteref-253"><small>253</small></a>, contributed
to enfeeble and corrupt the national character.  Unable to defend
themselves by their own exertions against any enemy, the Delphians
relied on the passive protection afforded by the superstitious
reverence of their neighbours, or on the firm alliance that existed
between themselves and the great Spartan representatives of their
common Dorian race.  The Athenian government could not but deem it
desirable to wrest from the Delphians the charge over the oracle and
the temple, since that charge might at any time be rendered
subservient to the Spartan cause; and accordingly they appear to have
connived at a bold attempt of the Phocians, who were now their allies.
These hardier neighbours of the sacred city claimed and forcibly
seized the right of superintendence of the temple.  The Spartans,
alarmed and aroused, despatched an armed force to Delphi, and restored
their former privileges to the citizens.  They piously gave to their
excursion the name of the Sacred War.  Delphi formally renounced the
Phocian league, declared itself an independent state, and even defined
the boundaries between its own and the Phocian domains.  Sparta was
rewarded for its aid by the privilege of precedence in consulting the
oracle, and this decree the Spartans inscribed on a brazen wolf in the
sacred city.  The Athenians no longer now acted through others&mdash;they
recognised all the advantage of securing to their friends and wresting
from their foes the management of an oracle, on whose voice depended
fortune in war and prosperity in peace.  Scarce had the Spartans
withdrawn, than an Athenian force, headed by Pericles, who is said to
have been freed by Anaxagoras from superstitious prejudices, entered
the city, and restored the temple to the Phocians.  The same image
which had recorded the privilege of the Spartans now bore an
inscription which awarded the right of precedence to the Athenians.
The good fortune of this expedition was soon reversed.
</p>
<p>
III.  When the Athenians, after the battle of Oenophyta, had
established in the Boeotian cities democratic forms of government, the
principal members of the defeated oligarchy, either from choice or by
compulsion, betook themselves to exile.  These malecontents, aided, no
doubt, by partisans who did not share their banishment, now seized
upon Chaeronea, Orchomenus, and some other Boeotian towns.  The
Athenians, who had valued themselves on restoring liberty to Boeotia,
and, for the first time since the Persian war, had honoured with
burial at the public expense those who fell under Myronides, could not
regard this attempt at counterrevolution with indifference.  Policy
aided their love of liberty; for it must never be forgotten that the
change from democratic to oligarchic government in the Grecian states
was the formal exchange of the Athenian for the Spartan alliance.  Yet
Pericles, who ever unwillingly resorted to war, and the most
remarkable attribute of whose character was a profound and calculating
caution, opposed the proposition of sending an armed force into
Boeotia.  His objections were twofold&mdash;he considered the time
unseasonable, and he was averse to hazard upon an issue not
immediately important to Athens the flower of her Hoplites, or
heavy-armed soldiery, of whom a thousand had offered their services in
the enterprise.  Nevertheless, the counsel of Tolmides, who was eager
for the war, and flushed with past successes, prevailed.  "If," said
Pericles, "you regard not my experience, wait, at least, for the advice
of TIME, that best of counsellors."  The saying was forgotten in the
popular enthusiasm it opposed&mdash;it afterward attained the veneration of a
prophecy. <a href="#note-254" name="noteref-254"><small>254</small></a>
</p>
<p>
IV.  Aided by some allied troops, and especially by his thousand
volunteers, Tolmides swept into Boeotia&mdash;reduced Chaeronea&mdash;garrisoned
the captured town, and was returning homeward, when, in the territory
of Coronea, he suddenly fell in with a hostile ambush <a href="#note-255" name="noteref-255"><small>255</small></a>, composed
of the exiled bands of Orchomenus, of Opuntian Locrians, and the
partisans of the oligarchies of Euboea.  Battle ensued&mdash;the Athenians
received a signal and memorable defeat (B. C. 447); many were made
prisoners, many slaughtered: the pride and youth of the Athenian
Hoplites were left on the field; the brave and wealthy Clinias (father
to the yet more renowned Alcibiades), and Tolmides himself, were
slain.  But the disaster of defeat was nothing in comparison with its
consequences.  To recover their prisoners, the Athenian government
were compelled to enter into a treaty with the hostile oligarchies and
withdraw their forces from Boeotia.  On their departure, the old
oligarchies everywhere replaced the friendly democracies, and the
nearest neighbours of Athens were again her foes.  Nor was this change
confined to Boeotia.  In Locris and Phocis the popular party fell with
the fortunes of Coronea&mdash;the exiled oligarchies were re-established&mdash;
and when we next read of these states, they are the allies of Sparta.
At home, the results of the day of Coronea were yet more important.
By the slaughter of so many of the Hoplites, the aristocratic party in
Athens were greatly weakened, while the neglected remonstrances and
fears of Pericles, now remembered, secured to him a respect and
confidence which soon served to turn the balance against his
competitor Thucydides.
</p>
<p>
V.  The first defeat of the proud mistress of the Grecian sea was a
signal for the revolt of disaffected dependants.  The Isle of Euboea,
the pasturages of which were now necessary to the Athenians,
encouraged by the success that at Coronea had attended the arms of the
Euboean exiles, shook off the Athenian yoke (B. C. 445).  In the same
year expired the five years truce with Sparta, and that state
forthwith prepared to avenge its humiliation at Delphi.  Pericles
seems once more to have been called into official power&mdash;he was not
now supine in action.  At the head of a sufficient force he crossed
the channel, and landed in Euboea.  Scarce had he gained the island,
when he heard that Megara had revolted&mdash;that the Megarians, joined by
partisans from Sicyon, Epidaurus, and Corinth, had put to the sword
the Athenian garrison, save a few who had ensconced themselves in
Nisaea, and that an army of the Peloponnesian confederates was
preparing to march to Attica.  On receiving these tidings, Pericles
re-embarked his forces and returned home.  Soon appeared the
Peloponnesian forces, commanded by the young Pleistoanax, king of
Sparta, who, being yet a minor, was placed under the guardianship of
Cleandridas; the lands by the western frontier of Attica, some of the
most fertile of that territory, were devastated, and the enemy
penetrated to Eleusis and Thria.  But not a blow was struck&mdash;they
committed the aggression and departed.  On their return to Sparta,
Pleistoanax and Cleandridas were accused of having been bribed to
betray the honour or abandon the revenge of Sparta.  Cleandridas fled
the prosecution, and was condemned to death in his exile.  Pleistoanax
also quitted the country, and took refuge in Arcadia, in the sanctuary
of Mount Lycaeum.  The suspicions of the Spartans appear to have been
too well founded, and Pericles, on passing his accounts that year, is
stated to have put down ten talents <a href="#note-256" name="noteref-256"><small>256</small></a> as devoted to a certain use
&mdash;an item which the assembly assented to in conscious and sagacious
silence.  This formidable enemy retired, Pericles once more entered
Euboea, and reduced the isle (B. C. 445).  In Chalcis he is said by
Plutarch to have expelled the opulent landowners, who, no doubt,
formed the oligarchic chiefs of the revolt, and colonized Histiaea
with Athenians, driving out at least the greater part of the native
population <a href="#note-257" name="noteref-257"><small>257</small></a>.  For the latter severity was given one of the
strongest apologies that the stern justice of war can plead for its
harshest sentences&mdash;the Histiaeans had captured an Athenian vessel and
murdered the crew.  The rest of the island was admitted to conditions,
by which the amount of tribute was somewhat oppressively increased.
<a href="#note-258" name="noteref-258"><small>258</small></a>
</p>
<p>
VI.  The inglorious result of the Peloponnesian expedition into Attica
naturally tended to make the Spartans desirous of peace upon
honourable terms, while the remembrance of dangers, eluded rather than
crushed, could not fail to dispose the Athenian government to
conciliate a foe from whom much was to be apprehended and little
gained.  Negotiations were commenced and completed (B. C. 445).  The
Athenians surrendered some of the most valuable fruits of their
victories in their hold on the Peloponnesus.  They gave up their claim
on Nisaea and Pegae&mdash;they renounced the footing they had established
in Troezene&mdash;they abandoned alliance or interference with Achaia, over
which their influence had extended to a degree that might reasonably
alarm the Spartans, since they had obtained the power to raise troops
in that province, and Achaean auxiliaries had served under Pericles at
the siege of Oeniadae <a href="#note-259" name="noteref-259"><small>259</small></a>.  Such were the conditions upon which a
truce of thirty years was based <a href="#note-260" name="noteref-260"><small>260</small></a>.  The articles were ostensibly
unfavourable to Athens.  Boeotia was gone&mdash;Locris, Phocis, an internal
revolution (the result of Coronea) had torn from their alliance.  The
citizens of Delphi must have regained the command of their oracle,
since henceforth its sacred voice was in favour of the Spartans.
Megara was lost&mdash;and now all the holds on the Peloponnesus were
surrendered.  These reverses, rapid and signal, might have taught the
Athenians how precarious is ever the military eminence of small
states.  But the treaty with Sparta, if disadvantageous, was not
dishonourable.  It was founded upon one broad principle, without
which, indeed, all peace would have been a mockery&mdash;viz., that the
Athenians should not interfere with the affairs of the Peloponnesus.
This principle acknowledged, the surrender of advantages or conquests
that were incompatible with it was but a necessary detail.  As
Pericles was at this time in office <a href="#note-261" name="noteref-261"><small>261</small></a>, and as he had struggled
against an armed interference with the Boeotian towns, so it is
probable that he followed out his own policy in surrendering all right
to interfere with the Peloponnesian states.  Only by peace with Sparta
could he accomplish his vast designs for the greatness of Athens&mdash;
designs which rested not upon her land forces, but upon her confirming
and consolidating her empire of the sea; and we shall shortly find, in
our consideration of her revenues, additional reasons for approving a
peace essential to her stability.
</p>
<p>
VII.  Scarce was the truce effected ere the struggle between
Thucydides and Pericles approached its crisis.  The friends of the
former never omitted an occasion to charge Pericles with having too
lavishly squandered the public funds upon the new buildings which
adorned the city.  This charge of extravagance, ever an accusation
sure to be attentively received by a popular assembly, made a sensible
impression.  "If you think," said Pericles to the great tribunal
before which he urged his defence, "that I have expended too much,
charge the sums to my account, not yours&mdash;but on this condition, let
the edifices be inscribed with my name, not that of the Athenian
people."  This mode of defence, though perhaps but an oratorical
hyperbole <a href="#note-262" name="noteref-262"><small>262</small></a>, conveyed a rebuke which the Athenians were an
audience calculated to answer but in one way&mdash;they dismissed the
accusation, and applauded the extravagance.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Accusations against public men, when unsuccessful, are the
fairest stepping-stones in their career.  Thucydides failed against
Pericles.  The death of Tolmides&mdash;the defeat of Coronea&mdash;the slaughter
of the Hoplites&mdash;weakened the aristocratic party; the democracy and
the democratic administration seized the occasion for a decisive
effort.  Thucydides was summoned to the ostracism, and his banishment
freed Pericles from his only rival for the supreme administration of
the Athenian empire.

</p>
<p>
I.  In the age of Pericles (B. C. 444) there is that which seems to
excite, in order to disappoint, curiosity.  We are fully impressed
with the brilliant variety of his gifts&mdash;with the influence he
exercised over his times.  He stands in the midst of great and
immortal names, at the close of a heroic, and yet in the sudden
meridian of a civilized age.  And scarcely does he recede from our
gaze, ere all the evils which only his genius could keep aloof, gather
and close around the city which it was the object of his life not less
to adorn as for festival than to crown as for command.  It is almost
as if, with Pericles, her very youth departed from Athens.  Yet so
scanty are our details and historical materials, that the life of this
surprising man is rather illustrated by the general light of the times
than by the blaze of his own genius.  His military achievements are
not dazzling.  No relics, save a few bold expressions, remain of the
eloquence which awed or soothed, excited or restrained, the most
difficult audience in the world.  It is partly by analyzing the works
of his contemporaries&mdash;partly by noting the rise of the whole people&mdash;
and partly by bringing together and moulding into a whole the
scattered masses of his ambitious and thoughtful policy, that we alone
can gauge and measure the proportions of the master-spirit of the
time.  The age of Pericles is the sole historian of Pericles.
</p>
<p>
This statesman was now at that period of life when public men are
usually most esteemed&mdash;when, still in the vigour of manhood, they have
acquired the dignity and experience of years, outlived the earlier
prejudices and jealousies they excited, and see themselves surrounded
by a new generation, among whom rivals must be less common than
disciples and admirers.  Step by step, through a long and consistent
career, he had ascended to his present eminence, so that his rise did
not startle from its suddenness; while his birth, his services, and
his genius presented a combination of claims to power that his enemies
could not despise, and that justified the enthusiasm of his friends.
His public character was unsullied; of the general belief in his
integrity there is the highest evidence <a href="#note-263" name="noteref-263"><small>263</small></a>; and even the few
slanders afterward raised against him&mdash;such as that of entering into
one war to gratify the resentment of Aspasia, and into another to
divert attention from his financial accounts, are libels so
unsupported by any credible authority, and so absurd in themselves,
that they are but a proof how few were the points on which calumny
could assail him.
</p>
<p>
II.  The obvious mode to account for the moral power of a man in any
particular time, is to consider his own character, and to ascertain
how far it is suited to command the age in which he lived and the
people whom he ruled.  No Athenian, perhaps, ever possessed so many
qualities as Pericles for obtaining wide and lasting influence over
the various classes of his countrymen.  By his attention to maritime
affairs, he won the sailors, now the most difficult part of the
population to humour or control; his encouragement to commerce secured
the merchants and conciliated the alien settlers; while the stupendous
works of art, everywhere carried on, necessarily obtained the favour
of the mighty crowd of artificers and mechanics whom they served to
employ.  Nor was it only to the practical interests, but to all the
more refined, yet scarce less powerful sympathies of his countrymen,
that his character appealed for support.  Philosophy, with all
parties, all factions, was becoming an appetite and passion.  Pericles
was rather the friend than the patron of philosophers.  The increasing
refinement of the Athenians&mdash;the vast influx of wealth that poured
into the treasury from the spoils of Persia and the tributes of
dependant cities, awoke the desire of art; and the graceful intellect
of Pericles at once indulged and directed the desire, by advancing
every species of art to its perfection.  The freedom of democracy&mdash;the
cultivation of the drama (which is the oratory of poetry)&mdash;the rise of
prose literature&mdash;created the necessity of popular eloquence&mdash;and with
Pericles the Athenian eloquence was born.  Thus his power was derived
from a hundred sources: whether from the grosser interests&mdash;the mental
sympathies&mdash;the vanity&mdash;ambition&mdash;reason&mdash;or imagination of the
people.  And in examining the character of Pericles, and noting its
harmony with his age, the admiration we bestow on himself must be
shared by his countrymen.  He obtained a greater influence than
Pisistratus, but it rested solely on the free-will of the Athenians&mdash;
it was unsupported by armed force&mdash;it was subject to the laws&mdash;it
might any day be dissolved; and influence of this description is only
obtained, in free states, by men who are in themselves the likeness
and representative of the vast majority of the democracy they wield.
Even the aristocratic party that had so long opposed him appear, with
the fall of Thucydides, to have relaxed their hostilities.  In fact,
they had less to resent in Pericles than in any previous leader of the
democracy.  He was not, like Themistocles, a daring upstart, vying
with, and eclipsing their pretensions.  He was of their own order.
His name was not rendered odious to them by party proscriptions or the
memory of actual sufferings.  He himself had recalled their idol
Cimon&mdash;and in the measures that had humbled the Areopagus, so
discreetly had he played his part, or so fortunately subordinate had
been his co-operation, that the wrath of the aristocrats had fallen
only on Ephialtes.  After the ostracism of Thucydides, "he became,"
says Plutarch <a href="#note-264" name="noteref-264"><small>264</small></a>, "a new man&mdash;no longer so subservient to the
multitude&mdash;and the government assumed an aristocratical, or rather
monarchical, form."  But these expressions in Plutarch are not to be
literally received.  The laws remained equally democratic&mdash;the agora
equally strong&mdash;Pericles was equally subjected to the popular control;
but having now acquired the confidence of the people, he was enabled
more easily to direct them, or, as Thucydides luminously observes,
"Not having obtained his authority unworthily, he was not compelled to
flatter or to sooth the popular humours, but, when occasion required,
he could even venture vehemently to contradict them." <a href="#note-265" name="noteref-265"><small>265</small></a>  The cause
which the historian assigns to the effect is one that deserves to be
carefully noted by ambitious statesmen&mdash;because the authority of
Pericles was worthily acquired, the people often suffered it to be
even unpopularly exercised.  On the other hand, this far-seeing and
prudent statesman was, no doubt, sufficiently aware of the dangers to
which the commonwealth was exposed, if the discontents of the great
aristocratic faction were not in some degree conciliated, to induce
his wise and sober patriotism, if not actually to seek the favour of
his opponents, at least cautiously to shun all idle attempts to
revenge past hostilities or feed the sources of future irritation.  He
owed much to the singular moderation and evenness of his temper; and
his debt to Anaxagoras must have been indeed great, if the lessons of
that preacher of those cardinal virtues of the intellect, serenity and
order, had assisted to form the rarest of all unions&mdash;a genius the
most fervid, with passions the best regulated.
</p>
<p>
III.  It was about this time, too, in all probability, that Pericles
was enabled to consummate the policy he had always adopted with
respect to the tributary allies.  We have seen that the treasury had
been removed from Delos to Athens; it was now resolved to make Athens
also the seat and centre of the judicial authority.  The subject
allies were compelled, if not on minor, at least on all important
cases, to resort to Athenian courts of law for justice <a href="#note-266" name="noteref-266"><small>266</small></a>.  And
thus Athens became, as it were, the metropolis of the allies.  A more
profound and sagacious mode of quickly establishing her empire it was
impossible for ingenuity to conceive; but as it was based upon an
oppression that must have been daily and intolerably felt&mdash;that every
affair of life must have called into irritating action, so, with the
establishment of the empire was simultaneously planted an inevitable
cause of its decay.  For though power is rarely attained without
injustice, the injustice, if continued, is the never-failing principle
of its corruption.  And, in order to endure, authority must hasten to
divest itself of all the more odious attributes of conquest.
</p>
<p>
IV.  As a practical statesman, one principal point of view in which we
must regard Pericles is in his capacity of a financier.  By English
historians his policy and pretensions in this department have not been
sufficiently considered; yet, undoubtedly, they made one of the most
prominent features of his public character in the eyes of his
countrymen.  He is the first minister in Athens who undertook the
scientific management of the national revenues, and partly from his
scrupulous integrity, partly from his careful wisdom, and partly from
a fortunate concurrence of circumstances, the Athenian revenues, even
when the tribute was doubled, were never more prosperously
administered.  The first great source of the revenue was from the
tributes of the confederate cities <a href="#note-267" name="noteref-267"><small>267</small></a>.  These, rated at four
hundred and sixty talents in the time of Aristides, had increased to
six hundred in the time of Pericles; but there is no evidence to prove
that the increased sum was unfairly raised, or that fresh exactions
were levied, save in rare cases <a href="#note-268" name="noteref-268"><small>268</small></a>, on the original subscribers to
the league.  The increase of a hundred and forty talents is to be
accounted for partly by the quota of different confederacies acquired
since the time of Aristides, partly by the exemption from military or
maritime service, voluntarily if unwisely purchased, during the
administration of Cimon, by the states themselves.  So far as tribute
was a sign of dependance and inferiority, the impost was a hardship;
but for this they who paid it are to be blamed rather than those who
received.  Its practical burden on each state, at this period,
appears, in most cases, to have been incredibly light; and a very
trifling degree of research will prove how absurdly exaggerated have
been the invectives of ignorant or inconsiderate men, whether in
ancient or modern times, on the extortions of the Athenians, and the
impoverishment of their allies.  Aristophanes <a href="#note-269" name="noteref-269"><small>269</small></a> attributes to the
empire of Athens a thousand tributary cities: the number is doubtless
a poetical license; yet, when we remember the extent of territory
which the league comprehended, and how crowded with cities were all
the coasts and islands of Greece, we should probably fall short of the
number of tributary cities if we estimated it at six hundred; so that
the tribute would not in the time of Pericles average above a talent,
or 241l. 13s. 4d. <a href="#note-270" name="noteref-270"><small>270</small></a> English money, for each city!  Even when in a
time of urgent demand on the resources of the state <a href="#note-271" name="noteref-271"><small>271</small></a>, Cythera
fell into the hands of the Athenians <a href="#note-272" name="noteref-272"><small>272</small></a>, the tribute of that island
was assessed but at four talents.  And we find, by inscriptions still
extant, that some places were rated only at two thousand, and even one
thousand drachmas. <a href="#note-273" name="noteref-273"><small>273</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Finally, if the assessment by Aristides, of four hundred and sixty
talents, was such as to give universal satisfaction from its equity
and moderation, the additional hundred and forty talents in the time
of Pericles could not have been an excessive increase, when we
consider how much the league had extended, how many states had
exchanged the service for the tribute, and how considerable was the
large diffusion of wealth throughout the greater part of Greece, the
continued influx of gold <a href="#note-274" name="noteref-274"><small>274</small></a>, and the consequent fall in value of
the precious metals.
</p>
<p>
V.  It was not, then, the amount of the tribute which made its
hardship, nor can the Athenian government be blamed for having
continued, a claim voluntarily conceded to them.  The original object
of the tribute was the maintenance of a league against the barbarians
&mdash;the Athenians were constituted the heads of the league and the
guardians of the tribute; some states refused service and offered
money&mdash;their own offers were accepted; other states refused both&mdash;it
was not more the interest than the duty of Athens to maintain, even by
arms, the condition of the league&mdash;so far is her policy justifiable.
But she erred when she reduced allies to dependants&mdash;she erred when
she transferred the treasury from the central Delos to her own state&mdash;
she erred yet more when she appropriated a portion of these treasures
to her own purposes.  But these vices of Athens are the vices of all
eminent states, monarchic or republican&mdash;for they are the vices of the
powerful.  "It was," say the Athenian ambassadors in Thucydides, with
honest candour and profound truth&mdash;"it was from the nature of the
thing itself that we were at first compelled to advance our empire to
what it is&mdash;chiefly through fear&mdash;next for honour&mdash;and, lastly, for
interest; and then it seemed no longer safe for us to venture to let
go the reins of government, for the revolters would have gone over to
you" (viz., to the Spartans) <a href="#note-275" name="noteref-275"><small>275</small></a>.  Thus does the universal lesson of
history teach us that it is the tendency of power, in what hands
soever it be placed, to widen its limits, to increase its vigour, in
proportion as the counteracting force resigns the security for its
administration, or the remedy for its abuse.
</p>
<p>
VI.  Pericles had not scrupled, from the date of the transfer of the
treasury to Athens, to devote a considerable proportion of the general
tribute to public buildings and sacred exhibitions&mdash;purposes purely
Athenian.  But he did so openly&mdash;he sought no evasion or disguise&mdash;he
maintained in the face of Greece that the Athenians were not
responsible to the allies for these contributions; that it was the
Athenians who had resisted and defended the barbarians, while many of
the confederate states had supplied neither ships nor soldiers; that
Athens was now the head of a mighty league; and that, to increase her
glory, to cement her power, was a duty she owed no less to the allies
than to herself.  Arguments to which armies, and not orators, could
alone reply. <a href="#note-276" name="noteref-276"><small>276</small></a>
</p>
<p>
The principal other sources whence the Athenian revenue was derived,
it may be desirable here to state as briefly and as clearly as the
nature of the subject will allow.  By those who would search more
deeply, the long and elaborate statistics of Boeckh must be carefully
explored.  Those sources of revenue were&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1st. Rents from corporate estates&mdash;such as pastures, forests, rivers,
salt-works, houses, theatres, etc., and mines, let for terms of years,
or on heritable leases.
</p>
<p>
2dly.  Tolls, export and import duties, probably paid only by
strangers, and amounting to two per cent., a market excise, and the
twentieth part of all exports and imports levied in the dependant
allied cities&mdash;the last a considerable item.
</p>
<p>
3dly. Tithes, levied only on lands held in usufruct, as estates
belonging to temples.
</p>
<p>
4thly. A protection tax <a href="#note-277" name="noteref-277"><small>277</small></a>, paid by the settlers, or Metoeci,
common to most of the Greek states, but peculiarly productive in
Athens from the number of strangers that her trade, her festivals, and
her renown attracted.  The policy of Pericles could not fail to
increase this source of revenue.
</p>
<p>
5thly. A slave tax of three obols per head. <a href="#note-278" name="noteref-278"><small>278</small></a>
</p>
<p>
Most of these taxes appear to have been farmed out.
</p>
<p>
6thly. Judicial fees and fines.  As we have seen that the allies in
most important trials were compelled to seek justice in Athens, this,
in the time of Pericles, was a profitable source of income.  But it
was one, the extent of which necessarily depended upon peace.
</p>
<p>
Fines were of many classes, but not, at least in this period, of very
great value to the state.  Sometimes (as in all private accusations)
the fine fell to the plaintiff, sometimes a considerable proportion
enriched the treasury of the tutelary goddess.  The task of assessing
the fines was odious, and negligently performed by the authorities,
while it was easy for those interested to render a false account of
their property.
</p>
<p>
Lastly. The state received the aid of annual contributions, or what
were termed liturgies, from individuals for particular services.
</p>
<p>
The ordinary liturgies were, 1st. The Choregia, or duty of furnishing
the chorus for the plays&mdash;tragic, comic, and satirical&mdash;of
remunerating the leader of the singers and musicians&mdash;of maintaining
the latter while trained&mdash;of supplying the dresses, the golden crowns
and masks, and, indeed, the general decorations and equipments of the
theatre.  He on whom this burdensome honour fell was called Choregus;
his name, and that of his tribe, was recorded on the tripod which
commemorated the victory of the successful poet, whose performances
were exhibited. <a href="#note-279" name="noteref-279"><small>279</small></a>
</p>
<p>
2dly. The Gymnasiarchy, or charge of providing for the expense of the
torch-race, celebrated in honour of the gods of fire, and some other
sacred games.  In later times the gymnasiarchy comprised the
superintendence of the training schools, and the cost of ornamenting
the arena.
</p>
<p>
3dly. The Architheoria, or task of maintaining the embassy to sacred
games and festivals.
</p>
<p>
And, 4thly, the Hestiasis, or feasting of the tribes, a costly
obligation incurred by some wealthy member of each tribe for
entertaining the whole of the tribe at public, but not very luxurious,
banquets.  This last expense did not often occur.  The hestiasis was
intended for sacred objects, connected with the rites of hospitality,
and served to confirm the friendly intercourse between the members of
the tribe.
</p>
<p>
These three ordinary liturgies had all a religious character; they
were compulsory on those possessed of property not less than three
talents&mdash;they were discharged in turn by the tribes, except when
volunteered by individuals.
</p>
<p>
VII.  The expenses incurred for the defence or wants of the state were
not regular, but extraordinary liturgies&mdash;such as the TRIERARCHY, or
equipment of ships, which entailed also the obligation of personal
service on those by whom the triremes were fitted out.  Personal
service was indeed the characteristic of all liturgies, a
property-tax, which was not yet invented, alone excepted; and this,
though bearing the name, has not the features, of a liturgy.  Of the
extraordinary liturgies, the trierarchy was the most important.  It
was of very early origin.  Boeckh observes <a href="#note-280" name="noteref-280"><small>280</small></a> that it was mentioned
in the time of Hippias.  At the period of which we treat each vessel
had one trierarch.  The vessel was given to the trierarch, sometimes
ready equipped; he also received the public money for certain
expenses; others fell on himself <a href="#note-281" name="noteref-281"><small>281</small></a>.  Occasionally, but rarely, an
ambitious or patriotic trierarch defrayed the whole cost; but in any
case he rendered strict account of the expenses incurred.  The cost of
a whole trierarchy was not less than forty minas, nor more than a
talent.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Two liturgies could not be demanded simultaneously from any
individual, nor was he liable to any one more often than every other
year.  He who served the trierarchies was exempted from all other
contributions.  Orphans were exempted till the year after they had
obtained their majority, and a similar exemption was, in a very few
instances, the reward of eminent public services.  The nine archons
were also exempted from the trierarchies.
</p>
<p>
IX.  The moral defects of liturgies were the defects of a noble
theory, which almost always terminates in practical abuses.  Their
principle was that of making it an honour to contribute to the public
splendour or the national wants.  Hence, in the earlier times, an
emulation among the rich to purchase favour by a liberal, but often
calculating and interested ostentation; hence, among the poor,
actuated by an equal ambition, was created so great a necessity for
riches as the means to power <a href="#note-282" name="noteref-282"><small>282</small></a>, that the mode by which they were
to be acquired was often overlooked.  What the theory designed as the
munificence of patriotism, became in practice but a showy engine of
corruption; and men vied with each other in the choregia or the
trierarchy, not so much for the sake of service done to the state, as
in the hope of influence acquired over the people.  I may also
observe, that in a merely fiscal point of view, the principle of
liturgies was radically wrong; that principle went to tax the few
instead of the many; its operation was therefore not more unequal in
its assessments than it was unproductive to the state in proportion to
its burden on individuals.
</p>
<p>
X.  The various duties were farmed&mdash;a pernicious plan of finance
common to most of the Greek states.  The farmers gave sureties, and
punctuality was rigorously exacted from them, on penalty of
imprisonment, the doubling of the debt, the confiscation of their
properties, the compulsory hold upon their sureties.
</p>
<p>
XI.  Such were the main sources of the Athenian revenue.
Opportunities will occur to fill up the brief outline and amplify each
detail.  This sketch is now presented to the reader as comprising a
knowledge necessary to a clear insight into the policy of Pericles.  A
rapid glance over the preceding pages will suffice to show that it was
on a rigid avoidance of all unnecessary war&mdash;above all, of distant and
perilous enterprises, that the revenue of Athens rested.  Her
commercial duties&mdash;her tax on settlers&mdash;the harvest of judicial fees,
obtained from the dependant allies&mdash;the chief profits from the mines&mdash;
all rested upon the maintenance of peace: even the foreign tribute,
the most productive of the Athenian resources, might fail at once, if
the Athenian arms should sustain a single reverse, as indeed it did
after the fatal battle of Aegospotamos <a href="#note-283" name="noteref-283"><small>283</small></a>.  This it was which might
have shown to the great finance minister that peace with the
Peloponnesus could scarce be too dearly purchased <a href="#note-284" name="noteref-284"><small>284</small></a>.  The
surrender of a few towns and fortresses was nothing in comparison with
the arrest and paralysis of all the springs of her wealth, which would
be the necessary result of a long war upon her own soil.  For this
reason Pericles strenuously checked all the wild schemes of the
Athenians for extended empire.  Yet dazzled with the glories of Cimon,
some entertained the hopes of recovering Egypt, some agitated the
invasion of the Persian coasts; the fair and fatal Sicily already
aroused the cupidity and ambition of others; and the vain enthusiasts
of the Agora even dreamed of making that island the base and centre of
a new and vast dominion, including Carthage on one hand and Etruria on
the other <a href="#note-285" name="noteref-285"><small>285</small></a>.  Such schemes it was the great object of Pericles to
oppose.  He was not less ambitious for the greatness of Athens than
the most daring of these visionaries; but he better understood on what
foundations it should be built.  His objects were to strengthen the
possessions already acquired, to confine the Athenian energies within
the frontiers of Greece, and to curb, as might better be done by peace
than war, the Peloponnesian forces to their own rocky barriers.  The
means by which he sought to attain these objects were, 1st, by a
maritime force; 2dly, by that inert and silent power which springs as
it were from the moral dignity and renown of a nation; whatever, in
this latter respect, could make Athens illustrious, made Athens
formidable.
</p>
<p>
XII.  Then rapidly progressed those glorious fabrics which seemed, as
Plutarch gracefully expresses it, endowed with the bloom of a
perennial youth.  Still the houses of private citizens remained simple
and unadorned; still were the streets narrow and irregular; and even
centuries afterward, a stranger entering Athens would not at first
have recognised the claims of the mistress of Grecian art.  But to the
homeliness of her common thoroughfares and private mansions, the
magnificence of her public edifices now made a dazzling contrast.  The
Acropolis, that towered above the homes and thoroughfares of men&mdash;a
spot too sacred for human habitation&mdash;became, to use a proverbial
phrase, "a city of the gods."  The citizen was everywhere to be
reminded of the majesty of the STATE&mdash;his patriotism was to be
increased by the pride in her beauty&mdash;his taste to be elevated by the
spectacle of her splendour.  Thus flocked to Athens all who throughout
Greece were eminent in art.  Sculptors and architects vied with each
other in adorning the young empress of the seas <a href="#note-286" name="noteref-286"><small>286</small></a>; then rose the
masterpieces of Phidias, of Callicrates, of Mnesicles <a href="#note-287" name="noteref-287"><small>287</small></a>, which
even, either in their broken remains, or in the feeble copies of
imitators less inspired, still command so intense a wonder, and
furnish models so immortal.  And if, so to speak, their bones and
relics excite our awe and envy, as testifying of a lovelier and
grander race, which the deluge of time has swept away, what, in that
day, must have been their brilliant effect&mdash;unmutilated in their fair
proportions&mdash;fresh in all their lineaments and hues?  For their beauty
was not limited to the symmetry of arch and column, nor their
materials confined to the marbles of Pentelicus and Paros.  Even the
exterior of the temples glowed with the richest harmony of colours,
and was decorated with the purest gold; an atmosphere peculiarly
favourable both to the display and the preservation of art, permitted
to external pediments and friezes all the minuteness of ornament&mdash;all
the brilliancy of colours; such as in the interior of Italian churches
may yet be seen&mdash;vitiated, in the last, by a gaudy and barbarous
taste.  Nor did the Athenians spare any cost upon the works that were,
like the tombs and tripods of their heroes, to be the monuments of a
nation to distant ages, and to transmit the most irrefragable proof
"that the power of ancient Greece was not an idle legend." <a href="#note-288" name="noteref-288"><small>288</small></a>  The
whole democracy were animated with the passion of Pericles; and when
Phidias recommended marble as a cheaper material than ivory for the
great statue of Minerva, it was for that reason that ivory was
preferred by the unanimous voice of the assembly.  Thus, whether it
were extravagance or magnificence, the blame in one case, the
admiration in another, rests not more with the minister than the
populace.  It was, indeed, the great characteristic of those works,
that they were entirely the creations of the people: without the
people, Pericles could not have built a temple or engaged a sculptor.
The miracles of that day resulted from the enthusiasm of a population
yet young&mdash;full of the first ardour for the beautiful&mdash;dedicating to
the state, as to a mistress, the trophies, honourably won or the
treasures injuriously extorted&mdash;and uniting the resources of a nation
with the energy of an individual, because the toil, the cost, were
borne by those who succeeded to the enjoyment and arrogated the glory.
</p>
<p>
XIII.  It was from two sources that Athens derived her chief political
vices; 1st, Her empire of the seas and her exactions from her allies;
2dly, an unchecked, unmitigated democratic action, void of the two
vents known in all modern commonwealths&mdash;the press, and a
representative, instead of a popular, assembly.  But from these
sources she now drew all her greatness also, moral and intellectual.
Before the Persian war, and even scarcely before the time of Cimon,
Athens cannot be said to have eclipsed her neighbours in the arts and
sciences.  She became the centre and capital of the most polished
communities of Greece, and she drew into a focus all the Grecian
intellect; she obtained from her dependants the wealth to administer
the arts, which universal traffic and intercourse taught her to
appreciate; and thus the Odeon, and the Parthenon, and the Propylaea
arose!  During the same administration, the fortifications were
completed, and a third wall, parallel <a href="#note-289" name="noteref-289"><small>289</small></a> and near to that uniting
Piraeus with Athens, consummated the works of Themistocles and Cimon,
and preserved the communication between the twofold city, even should
the outer walls fall into the hands of an enemy.
</p>
<p>
But honour and wealth alone would not have sufficed for the universal
emulation, the universal devotion to all that could adorn or exalt the
nation.  It was the innovations of Aristides and Ephialtes that
breathed into that abstract and cold formality, THE STATE, the breath
and vigour of a pervading people, and made the meanest citizen
struggle for Athens with that zeal with which an ambitious statesman
struggles for himself <a href="#note-290" name="noteref-290"><small>290</small></a>.  These two causes united reveal to us the
true secret why Athens obtained a pre-eminence in intellectual
grandeur over the rest of Greece.  Had Corinth obtained the command of
the seas and the treasury of Delos&mdash;had Corinth established abroad a
power equally arbitrary and extensive, and at home a democracy equally
broad and pure&mdash;Corinth might have had her Pericles and Demosthenes,
her Phidias, her Sophocles, her Aristophanes, her Plato&mdash;and posterity
might not have allowed the claim of Athens to be the Hellas Hellados,
"the Greece of Greece."
</p>
<p>
XIV.  But the increase of wealth bounded not its effects to these
magnificent works of art&mdash;they poured into and pervaded the whole
domestic policy of Athens.  We must recollect, that as the greatness
of the state was that of the democracy, so its treasures were the
property of the free population.  It was the people who were rich; and
according to all the notions of political economy in that day, the
people desired practically to enjoy their own opulence.  Thus was
introduced the principal of payment for service, and thus was
sanctioned and legalized the right of a common admission to
spectacles, the principal cost of which was defrayed from common
property.  That such innovations would be the necessary and
unavoidable result of an overflowing treasury in a state thus
democratic is so obvious, that nothing can be more absurd than to lay
the blame of the change upon Pericles.  He only yielded to, and
regulated the irresistible current of the general wish.  And we may
also observe, that most of those innovations, which were ultimately
injurious to Athens, rested upon the acknowledged maxims of modern
civilization; some were rather erroneous from details than principles;
others, from the want of harmony between the new principles and the
old constitution to which then were applied.  Each of the elements
might be healthful&mdash;amalgamated, they produced a poison.
</p>
<p>
XV.  It is, for instance, an axiom in modern politics that judges
should receive a salary <a href="#note-291" name="noteref-291"><small>291</small></a>.  During the administration of Pericles,
this principle was applied to the dicasts in the popular courts of
judicature.  It seems probable that the vast accession of law business
which ensued from the transfer of the courts in the allied states to
the Athenian tribunal was the cause of this enactment.  Lawsuits
became so common, that it was impossible, without salaries, that the
citizens could abandon their own business for that of others.  Payment
was, therefore, both equitable and unavoidable, and, doubtless, it
would have seemed to the Athenians, as now to us, the best means, not
only of securing the attention, but of strengthening the integrity, of
the judges or the jurors.  The principle of salaries was, therefore,
right, but its results were evil, when applied to the peculiar
constitution of the courts.  The salary was small&mdash;the judges
numerous, and mostly of the humblest class&mdash;the consequences I have
before shown <a href="#note-292" name="noteref-292"><small>292</small></a>.  Had the salaries been high and the number of the
judges small, the means of a good judicature would have been attained.
But, then, according to the notions, not only of the Athenians, but of
all the Hellenic democracies, the democracy itself, of which the
popular courts were deemed the constitutional bulwark and the vital
essence, would have been at an end.  In this error, therefore, however
fatal it might be, neither Pericles nor the Athenians, but the
theories of the age, are to be blamed <a href="#note-293" name="noteref-293"><small>293</small></a>.  It is also a maxim
formerly acted upon in England, to which many political philosophers
now incline, and which is yet adopted in the practice of a great and
enlightened portion of the world, that the members of the legislative
assembly should receive salaries.  This principle was now applied in
Athens <a href="#note-294" name="noteref-294"><small>294</small></a>.  But there the people themselves were the legislative
assembly, and thus a principle, perhaps sound in itself, became
vitiated to the absurdity of the people as sovereign paying the people
as legislative.  Yet even this might have been necessary to the
preservation of the constitution, as meetings became numerous and
business complicated; for if the people had not been tempted and even
driven to assemble in large masses, the business of the state would
have been jobbed away by active minorities, and the life of a
democracy been lost <a href="#note-295" name="noteref-295"><small>295</small></a>.  The payment was first one obolus&mdash;
afterward increased to three.  Nor must we suppose, as the ignorance
or effrontery of certain modern historians has strangely asserted,
that in the new system of payments the people were munificent only to
themselves.  The senate was paid&mdash;the public advocates and orators
were paid&mdash;so were the ambassadors, the inspectors of the youths in
the trading schools, the nomothetae or law-commissioners, the
physicians, the singers, even the poets; all the servants of the
different officers received salaries.  And now, as is the inevitable
consequence of that civilization in a commercial society which
multiplies and strongly demarcates the divisions of labour, the safety
of the state no longer rested solely upon the unpurchased arms and
hearts of its citizens&mdash;but not only were the Athenians themselves who
served as soldiers paid, but foreign mercenaries were engaged&mdash;a
measure in consonance with the characteristic policy of Pericles,
which was especially frugal of the lives of the citizens.  But
peculiar to the Athenians of all the Grecian states was the humane and
beautiful provision for the poor, commenced under Solon or
Pisistratus.  At this happy and brilliant period few were in need of
it&mdash;war and disaster, while they increased the number of the
destitute, widened the charity of the state.
</p>
<p>
XVI.  Thus, then, that general system of payment which grew up under
Pericles, and produced many abuses under his successors, was, after
all, but the necessary result of the increased civilization and
opulence of the period.  Nor can we wonder that the humbler or the
middle orders, who, from their common stock, lavished generosity upon
genius <a href="#note-296" name="noteref-296"><small>296</small></a>, and alone, of all contemporaneous states, gave relief to
want&mdash;who maintained the children of all who died in war&mdash;who awarded
remunerations for every service, should have deemed it no grasping
exaction to require for their own attendance on offices forced on them
by the constitution a compensation for the desertion of their private
affairs, little exceeding that which was conferred upon the very
paupers of the state. <a href="#note-297" name="noteref-297"><small>297</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XVII.  But there was another abuse which sprang out of the wealth of
the people, and that love for spectacles and exhibitions which was
natural to the lively Ionic imagination, and could not but increase as
leisure and refinement became boons extended to the bulk of the
population&mdash;an abuse trifling in itself&mdash;fatal in the precedent it
set.  While the theatre was of wood, free admissions were found to
produce too vast a concourse for the stability of the building; and
once, indeed, the seats gave way.  It was, therefore, long before the
present period, deemed advisable to limit the number of the audience
by a small payment of two obols for each seat; and this continued
after a stately edifice of stone replaced the wooden temple of the
earlier drama.
</p>
<p>
But as riches flowed into the treasury, and as the drama became more
and more the most splendid and popular of the national exhibitions, it
seemed but just to return to the ancient mode of gratuitous
admissions.  It was found, however, convenient, partly, perhaps, for
greater order and for the better allotment of the seats&mdash;partly, also,
for the payment of several expenses which fell not on the state, but
individuals&mdash;and partly, no doubt, to preserve the distinctions
between the citizens and the strangers, to maintain the prices, but to
allow to those whose names were enrolled in the book of the citizens
the admittance money from the public treasury.  This fund was called
the THEORICON.  But the example once set, Theorica were extended to
other festivals besides those of the drama <a href="#note-298" name="noteref-298"><small>298</small></a>, and finally, under
the plausible and popular pretext of admitting the poorer classes to
those national or religious festivals, from which, as forming the bulk
of the nation, it was against the theory of the constitution to
exclude them, paved the way to lavish distributions of the public
money, which at once tended to exhaust the wealth of the state, and to
render effeminate and frivolous the spirit of the people.  But these
abuses were not yet visible: on the contrary, under Pericles, the
results of the Theoricon were highly favourable to the manners and
genius of the people.  Art was thus rendered the universal right, and
while refinement of taste became diffused, the patriotism of the
citizens was increased by the consciousness that they were the common
and legitimate arbiters of all which augmented the splendour and
renown of Athens.
</p>
<p>
Thus, in fact, the after evils that resulted from the more popular
part of the internal policy of Pericles, it was impossible to foresee;
they originated not in a single statement, but in the very nature of
civilization.  And as in despotisms, a coarse and sensual luxury, once
established, rots away the vigour and manhood of a conquering people,
so in this intellectual republic it was the luxury of the intellect
which gradually enervated the great spirit of the victor race of
Marathon and Salamis, and called up generations of eloquent talkers
and philosophical dreamers from the earlier age of active freemen,
restless adventurers, and hardy warriors.  The spirit of poetry, or
the pampered indulgence of certain faculties to the prejudice of
others, produced in a whole people what it never fails to produce in
the individual: it unfitted them just as they grew up into a manhood
exposed to severer struggles than their youth had undergone&mdash;for the
stern and practical demands of life; and suffered the love of the
beautiful to subjugate or soften away the common knowledge of the
useful.  Genius itself became a disease, and poetry assisted towards
the euthanasia of the Athenians.
</p>
<p>
XVIII.  As all the measures of Pericles were directed towards
consolidating the Athenian empire, so under his administration was not
omitted the politic expedient of colonization.  Of late years, states
having become confirmed and tribes settled, the Grecian migrations
were far less frequent than of old; and one principal cause of
colonization, in the violent feud of parties, and the expulsion of a
considerable number of citizens, arose from the disasters of infant
communities, and was no longer in force under the free but strong
government of Athens.  As with the liberties fell the commerce of
Miletus and Ionia, so also another principal source of the old
colonization became comparatively languid and inert.  But now, under
the name of Cleruchi <a href="#note-299" name="noteref-299"><small>299</small></a>, a new description of colonists arose&mdash;
colonists by whom the mother country not only draughted off a
redundant population, or rid herself of restless adventurers, but
struck the roots of her empire in the various places that came under
her control.  In the classic as in the feudal age, conquest gave the
right to the lands of the conquered country.  Thus had arisen, and
thus still existed, upon the plundered lands of Laconia, the
commonwealth of Sparta&mdash;thus were maintained the wealthy and luxurious
nobles of Thessaly&mdash;and thus, in fine, were created all the ancient
Dorian oligarchies.  After the return of the Heraclidae, this mode of
consummating conquest fell into disuse, not from any moral conviction
of its injustice, but because the wars between the various states
rarely terminated in victories so complete as to permit the seizure of
the land and the subjugation of the inhabitants.  And it must be ever
remembered, that the old Grecian tribes made war to procure a
settlement, and not to increase dominion.  The smallness of their
population rendered human life too valuable to risk its waste in the
expeditions that characterized the ambition of the leaders of oriental
hordes.  But previous to the Persian wars, the fertile meadows of
Euboea presented to the Athenians a temptation it could scarcely be
expected that victorious neighbours would have the abstinence to
forego; and we have seen that they bestowed the lands of the
Hippobotae on Athenian settlers.  These colonists evacuated their
possessions during the Persian war: the Hippobotae returned, and seem
to have held quiet, but probably tributary, possession of their
ancient estates, until after the recent retreat of the Peloponnesians.
Pericles defeated and displaced them; their lands fell once more to
Athenian colonists; and the north of Euboea was protected and
garrisoned by the erection of Oreus, a new town that supplanted the
old Histiaea.  Territories in Scyros, Lemnos, and Imbros had been also
bestowed on Athenian settlers during the earlier successes of the
Athenian arms&mdash;and the precedent thus set, examples became more
numerous, under the profound and systematic policy of Pericles.  This
mode of colonization, besides the ordinary advantages of all
colonization, proffered two peculiar to itself.  In the first place,
it supplied the deficiency of land, which was one of the main
inconveniences of Attica, and rewarded the meritorious or appeased the
avaricious citizens, with estates which it did not impoverish the
mother country to grant.  2dly. It secured the conquests of the state
by planting garrisons which it cost little to maintain <a href="#note-300" name="noteref-300"><small>300</small></a>.  Thus
were despatched by Pericles a thousand men to the valuable possessions
in the Chersonese, two hundred and fifty to Andros, five hundred to
Naxos, a thousand to Thrace.  At another period, the date of which is
uncertain, but probably shortly subsequent to the truce with the
Peloponnesians, a large fleet, commanded by Pericles, swept the
Euxine, in order to awe and impress the various states and nations
along the adjacent coasts, whether Greek or barbarian, with the
display of the Athenian power; and the city of Sinope, being at that
time divided with contentions for and against its tyrant Timesilaus,
the republican party applied to the head of the Greek democracies for
aid.  Lamachus, a warrior to whose gallant name, afterward
distinguished in the Peloponnesian war, Aristophanes has accorded the
equal honour of his ridicule and his praise, was intrusted with
thirteen galleys and a competent force for the expulsion of the tyrant
and his adherents.  The object effected, the new government of Sinope
rewarded six hundred Athenians with the freedom of the city and the
estates of the defeated faction.
</p>
<p>
While thus Athens fixed her footing on remoter lands, gradually her
grasp extended over the more near and necessary demesnes of Euboea,
until the lands of more than two thirds of that island were in the
possession of Athenians <a href="#note-301" name="noteref-301"><small>301</small></a>.  At a later period, new opportunities
gave rise to new cleruchiae. <a href="#note-302" name="noteref-302"><small>302</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XIX.  Besides these cleruchiae, in the second year of the supreme
administration of Pericles a colony, properly so called, was
established in Western Italy&mdash;interesting alike from the great names
of its early adventurers, the beauty of its site, and from the
circumstance of its being, besides that at Amphipolis, the only pure
and legitimate colony <a href="#note-303" name="noteref-303"><small>303</small></a>, in contradistinction to the cleruchiae,
founded by Athens, since her ancient migrations to Ionia and the
Cyclades.  Two centuries before, some Achaeans, mingled with
Troezenians, had established, in the fertile garden of Magna Graecia,
the state of Sybaris.  Placed between two rivers, the Crathis and the
Sybaris&mdash;possessing extraordinary advantages of site and climate, this
celebrated colony rose with unparalleled rapidity to eminence in war
and luxury in peace.  So great were its population and resources, that
it is said by Diodorus to have brought at one time three hundred
thousand men into the field&mdash;an army which doubled that which all
Greece could assemble at Plataea!  The exaggeration is evident; but it
still attests the belief of a populousness and power which must have
rested upon no fabulous foundation.  The state of Sybaris had
prospered for a time by the adoption of a principle which is ever apt
to force civilization to premature development, and not unfrequently
to end in the destruction of national character and internal
stability&mdash;viz., it opened its arms to strangers of every tribe and
class.  Thronged by mercantile adventurers, its trade, like that of
Agrigentum, doubtless derived its sources from the oil and wine which
it poured into the harbours of Africa and Gaul.  As with individuals,
so with states, wealth easily obtained is prodigally spent, and the
effeminate and voluptuous ostentation of Sybaris passed into a proverb
more enduring than her prosperity.  Her greatness, acquired by a
tempered and active democracy, received a mortal blow by the
usurpation of a tyrant named Telys, who, in 510 B. C., expelled five
hundred of the principal citizens.  Croton received the exiles, a war
broke out, and in the same year, or shortly afterward, the
Crotoniates, under Milo, defeated the Sybarites with prodigious
slaughter, and the city was abandoned to pillage, and left desolate
and ruined.  Those who survived fled to Laos and Scidrus.  Fifty-eight
years afterward, aided by some Thessalians, the exiled Sybarites again
sought possession of their former settlement, but were speedily
expelled by the Crotoniates.  It was now that they applied to Sparta
and Athens for assistance.  The former state had neither population to
spare, nor commerce to strengthen, nor ambition to gratify, and
rejected the overtures of the Sybarite envoys.  But a different
success awaited the exiles at Athens.  Their proposition, timed in a
period when it was acceptable to the Athenian policy (B. C. 443), was
enforced by Pericles.  Adventurers from all parts of Greece, but
invited especially from the Peloponnesus, swelled the miscellaneous
band: eminent among the rest were Lysias, afterward so celebrated as a
rhetorician <a href="#note-304" name="noteref-304"><small>304</small></a>, and Herodotus, the historian.
</p>
<p>
As in the political code of Greece the religious character of the
people made a prevailing principle, so in colonization the deity of
the parent state transplanted his worship with his votaries, and the
relation between the new and the old country was expressed and
perpetuated by the touching symbol of taking fire from the Prytaneum
of the native city.  A renowned diviner, named Lampon <a href="#note-305" name="noteref-305"><small>305</small></a>, whose
sacred pretensions did not preserve him from the ridicule of the comic
poets <a href="#note-306" name="noteref-306"><small>306</small></a>, accompanied the emigrants (B. C. 440), and an oracle
dictated the site of the new colony near the ancient city, and by the
fountain of Thurium.  The Sybarites, with the common vanity of men
whose ancestors have been greater than themselves, increased their
pretensions in proportion as they lost their power; they affected
superiority over their companions, by whose swords alone they again
existed as a people; claimed the exclusive monopoly of the principal
offices of government, and the first choice of lands; and were finally
cut off by the very allies whose aid they had sought, and whose
resentment they provoked.  New adventurers from Greece replaced the
Sybarites, and the colonists of Thurium, divided into ten tribes
(four, the representatives of the united Ionians, Euboeans, Islanders,
and Athenians; three of the Peloponnesians; and three of the settlers
from Northern Greece)&mdash;retained peaceable possession of their
delightful territory, and harmonized their motley numbers by the
adoption of the enlightened laws and tranquil institutions of
Charondas.  Such was the home of Herodotus, the historian.

</p>
<p>
I.  In proportion as it had become matter of honourable pride and
lucrative advantage to be a citizen of Athens, it was natural that the
laws defining and limiting the freedom of the city should increase in
strictness.  Even before the time of Themistocles, those only were
considered legitimate <a href="#note-307" name="noteref-307"><small>307</small></a> who, on either side, derived parentage
from Athenian citizens.  But though illegitimate, they were not
therefore deprived of the rights of citizenship; nor had the stain
upon his birth been a serious obstacle to the career of Themistocles
himself.  Under Pericles, the law became more severe, and a decree was
passed (apparently in the earlier period of his rising power), which
excluded from the freedom of the city those whose parents were not
both Athenian.  In the very year in which he attained the supreme
administration of affairs, occasion for enforcing the law occurred:
Psammetichus, the pretender to the Egyptian throne, sent a present of
corn to the Athenian people (B. C. 444); the claimants for a share in
the gift underwent the ordeal of scrutiny as to their titles to
citizenship, and no less than five thousand persons were convicted of
having fraudulently foisted themselves into rights which were now
tantamount to property; they were disfranchised <a href="#note-308" name="noteref-308"><small>308</small></a>; and the whole
list of the free citizens was reduced to little more than fourteen
thousand. <a href="#note-309" name="noteref-309"><small>309</small></a>
</p>
<p>
II.  While under this brilliant and energetic administration Athens
was daily more and more concentrating on herself the reluctant
admiration and the growing fears of Greece, her policy towards her
dependant allies involved her in a war which ultimately gave, if not a
legal, at least an acknowledged, title to the pretensions she assumed.
Hostilities between the new population of Miletus and the oligarchic
government of Samos had been for some time carried on; the object of
contention was the city of Priene&mdash;united, apparently, with rival
claims upon Anaea, a town on the coast opposite Samos.  The Milesians,
unsuccessful in the war, applied to Athens for assistance.  As the
Samians were among the dependant allies, Pericles, in the name of the
Athenian people, ordered them to refer to Athens the decision of the
dispute; on their refusal an expedition of forty galleys was conducted
against them by Pericles in person.  A still more plausible colour
than that of the right of dictation was given to this interference;
for the prayer of the Milesians was backed and sanctioned by many of
the Samians themselves, oppressed by the oligarchic government which
presided over them.  A ridiculous assertion was made by the libellers
of the comic drama and the enemies of Pericles, that the war was
undertaken at the instigation of Aspasia, with whom that minister had
formed the closest connexion; but the expedition was the necessary and
unavoidable result of the twofold policy by which the Athenian
government invariably directed its actions; 1st, to enforce the right
of ascendency over its allies; 2dly, to replace oligarchic by
democratic institutions.  Nor, on this occasion, could Athens have
remained neutral or supine without materially weakening her hold upon
all the states she aspired at once to democratize and to govern.
</p>
<p>
III.  The fleet arrived at Samos&mdash;the oligarchic government was
deposed&mdash;one hundred hostages (fifty men&mdash;fifty boys) from its
partisans were taken and placed at Lemnos, and a garrison was left to
secure the new constitution of the island.  Some of the defeated
faction took refuge on the Asiatic continent&mdash;entered into an intrigue
with the Persian Pissuthnes, satrap of Sardis; and having, by
continued correspondence with their friends at Samos, secured
connivance at their attempt, they landed by night at Samos with a
hired force of seven hundred soldiers, and succeeded in mastering the
Athenian garrison, and securing the greater part of the chiefs of the
new administration; while, by a secret and well-contrived plot, they
regained their hostages left at Lemnos.  They then openly proclaimed
their independence&mdash;restored the oligarchy&mdash;and, as a formal proof of
defiance, surrendered to Pissuthnes the Athenians they had captured.
Byzantium hastened to join the revolt.  Their alliance with Pissuthnes
procured the Samians the promised aid of a Phoenician fleet, and they
now deemed themselves sufficiently strong to renew their hostilities
with Miletus.  Their plans were well laid, and their boldness made a
considerable impression on the states hostile to Athens.  Among the
Peloponnesian allies it was debated whether or not, despite the
treaty, the Samians should be assisted: opinions were divided, but
Corinth <a href="#note-310" name="noteref-310"><small>310</small></a>, perhaps, turned the scale, by insisting on the right of
every state to deal with its dependants.  Corinth had herself colonies
over which she desired to preserve a dictatorial sway; and she was
disposed to regard the Samian revolution less as the gallantry of
freemen than the enterprise of rebels.  It was fortunate, too,
perhaps, for Athens, that the Samian insurgents had sought their ally
in the Persian satrap; nor could the Peloponnesian states at that time
have decorously assisted the Persian against the Athenian arms.  But
short time for deliberation was left by a government which procured
for the Athenians the character to be not more quick to contrive than
to execute&mdash;to be the only people who could simultaneously project and
acquire&mdash;and who even considered a festival but as a day on which some
necessary business could be accomplished <a href="#note-311" name="noteref-311"><small>311</small></a>.  With a fleet of sixty
sail, Pericles made for Samos; some of the vessels were stationed on
the Carian coast to watch the movements of the anticipated Phoenician
re-enforcement; others were despatched to collect aid from Chios and
Lesbos.  Meanwhile, though thus reduced to forty-four sail, Pericles,
near a small island called Tragia, engaged the Samian fleet returning
from Miletus, consisting of seventy vessels, and gained a victory.
Then, re-enforced by forty galleys from Athens, and twenty-five from
Lesbos and Chios, he landed on the island, defeated the Samians in a
pitched battle, drove them into their city, invested it with a triple
line of ramparts, and simultaneously blockaded the city by sea.  The
besieged were not, however, too discouraged to sally out; and, under
Melissus, who was at once a philosopher and a hero, they even obtained
advantage in a seafight.  But these efforts were sufficiently
unimportant to permit Pericles to draw off sixty of his vessels, and
steer along the Carian coast to meet the expected fleet of the
Phoenicians.  The besieged did not suffer the opportunity thus
afforded them to escape&mdash;they surprised the naval blockading force,
destroyed the guard-ships, and joining battle with the rest of the
fleet, obtained a decisive victory (B. C. 440), which for fourteen
days left them the mastery of the open sea, and enabled them to
introduce supplies.
</p>
<p>
IV.  While lying in wait for the Phoenician squadron, which did not,
however, make its appearance, tidings of the Samian success were
brought to Pericles.  He hastened back and renewed the blockade&mdash;fresh
forces were sent to his aid&mdash;from Athens, forty-eight ships, under
three generals, Thucydides <a href="#note-312" name="noteref-312"><small>312</small></a>, Agnon, and Phormio; followed by
twenty more under Tlepolemus and Anticles, while Chios and Lesbos
supplied an additional squadron of thirty.  Still the besieged were
not disheartened; they ventured another engagement, which was but an
ineffectual struggle, and then, shut up within their city, stood a
siege of nine months.
</p>
<p>
With all the small Greek states it had ever been the policy of
necessity to shun even victories attended with great loss.  This
policy was refined by Pericles into a scientific system.  In the
present instance, he avoided all assaults which might weaken his
forces, and preferred the loss of time to the loss of life.  The
tedious length of the blockade occasioned some murmurs among the
lively and impatient forces he commanded; but he is said to have
diverted the time by the holyday devices, which in the middle ages
often so graced and softened the rugged aspect of war.  The army was
divided into eight parts, and by lot it was decided which one of the
eight divisions should, for the time, encounter the fatigues of actual
service; the remaining seven passed the day in sports and feasting
<a href="#note-313" name="noteref-313"><small>313</small></a>.  A concourse of women appear to have found their way to the
encampment <a href="#note-314" name="noteref-314"><small>314</small></a>, and a Samian writer ascribes to their piety or their
gratitude the subsequent erection of a temple to Venus.  The siege,
too, gave occasion to Pericles to make experiment of military engines,
which, if invented before, probably now received mechanical
improvement.  Although, in the earlier contest, mutual animosities had
been so keen that the prisoners on either side had been contumeliously
branded <a href="#note-315" name="noteref-315"><small>315</small></a>, it was, perhaps, the festive and easy manner in which
the siege was afterward carried on, that, mitigating the bitterness of
prolonged hostilities, served to procure, at last, for the Samians
articles of capitulation more than usually mild.  They embraced the
conditions of demolishing their fortifications, delivering up their
ships, and paying by instalments a portion towards the cost of the
siege <a href="#note-316" name="noteref-316"><small>316</small></a>.  Byzantium, which, commanding the entrance of the Euxine,
was a most important possession to the Athenians <a href="#note-317" name="noteref-317"><small>317</small></a>, whether for
ambition or for commerce, at the same time accepted, without
resistance, the terms held out to it, and became once more subject to
the Athenian empire.
</p>
<p>
V.  On his return, Pericles was received with an enthusiasm which
attested the sense entertained of the value of his conquest.  He
pronounced upon those who had fallen in the war a funeral oration.
<a href="#note-318" name="noteref-318"><small>318</small></a>  When he descended from the rostrum, the women crowded round and
showered fillets and chaplets on the eloquent victor.  Elpinice, the
sister of Cimon, alone shared not the general enthusiasm.  "Are these
actions," she said to Pericles, "worthy of chaplets and garlands?
actions purchased by the loss of many gallant citizens&mdash;not won
against the Phoenician and the Mede, like those of Cimon, but by the
ruin of a city united with ourselves in amity and origin."  The ready
minister replied to the invective of Elpinice by a line from
Archilochus, which, in alluding to the age and coquetry of the lady,
probably answered the oratorical purpose of securing the laugh on his
own side. <a href="#note-319" name="noteref-319"><small>319</small></a>
</p>
<p>
While these events confirmed the authority of Athens and the Athenian
government, a power had grown up within the city that assumed a right,
the grave assertion of which without the walls would have been deeply
felt and bitterly resented&mdash;a power that sat in severe and derisive
judgment upon Athens herself, her laws, her liberties, her mighty
generals, her learned statesmen, her poets, her sages, and her
arrogant democracy&mdash;a power that has come down to foreign nations and
distant ages as armed with irresistible weapons&mdash;which now is
permitted to give testimony, not only against individuals, but nations
themselves, but which, in that time, was not more effective in
practical results than at this day a caricature in St. James's-street,
or a squib in a weekly newspaper&mdash;a power which exposed to relentless
ridicule, before the most susceptible and numerous tribunal, the
loftiest names in rank, in wisdom, and in genius&mdash;and which could not
have deprived a beggar of his obol or a scavenger of his office: THE
POWER OF THE COMIC MUSE.
</p>
<p>
VI.  We have seen that in the early village festivals, out of which
grew the tragedy of Phrynichus and Aeschylus, there were, besides the
Dithyramb and the Satyrs, the Phallic processions, which diversified
the ceremony by the lowest jests mingled with the wildest satire.  As
her tragedy had its origin in the Dithyramb&mdash;as her satyric
after-piece had its origin in the satyric buffooneries&mdash;so out of the
Phallic processions rose the Comedy of Greece (B. C. 562) <a href="#note-320" name="noteref-320"><small>320</small></a>.
Susarion is asserted by some to have been a Megarian by origin; and
while the democracy of Megara was yet in force, he appears to have
roughly shaped the disorderly merriment of the procession into a rude
farce, interspersed with the old choral songs.  The close connexion
between Megara and Athens soon served to communicate to the latter the
improvements of Susarion; and these improvements obtained for the
Megarian the title of inventer of comedy, with about the same justice
as a similar degree of art conferred upon the later Thespis the
distinction of the origin of tragedy.  The study of Homer's epics had
suggested its true province to tragedy; the study of the Margites,
attributed also to Homer, seems to have defined and enlarged the
domain of comedy.  Eleven years after Phrynichus appeared, and just
previous to the first effort of Aeschylus (B. C. 500), Epicharmus, who
appears to have been a native of Cos <a href="#note-321" name="noteref-321"><small>321</small></a>, produced at Syracuse the
earliest symmetrical and systematic form of comic dialogue and fable.
All accounts prove him to have been a man of extraordinary genius, and
of very thoughtful and accomplished mind.  Perhaps the loss of his
works is not the least to be lamented of those priceless treasures
which time has destroyed.  So uncertain, after all, is the great
tribunal of posterity, which is often as little to be relied upon as
the caprice of the passing day!  We have the worthless Electra of
Euripides&mdash;we have lost all, save the titles and a few sententious
fragments, of thirty-five comedies of Epicharmus!  Yet if Horace
inform us rightly, that the poet of Syracuse was the model of Plautus,
perhaps in the Amphitryon we can trace the vein and genius of the
father of true comedy; and the thoughts and the plot of the lost
Epicharmus may still exist, mutilated and disguised, in the humours of
the greatest comic poet <a href="#note-322" name="noteref-322"><small>322</small></a> of modern Europe.
</p>
<p>
VII.  It was chiefly from the rich stores of mythology that Epicharmus
drew his fables; but what was sublimity with the tragic poet, was
burlesque with the comic.  He parodied the august personages and
venerable adventures of the gods of the Greek Pantheon.  By a singular
coincidence, like his contemporary Aeschylus <a href="#note-323" name="noteref-323"><small>323</small></a>, he was a
Pythagorean, and it is wonderful to observe how rapidly and how
powerfully the influence of the mysterious Samian operated on the most
original intellects of the age.  The familiar nature of the Hellenic
religion sanctioned, even in the unphilosophical age of Homer, a
treatment of celestial persons that to our modern notions would, at
first glance, evince a disrespect for the religion itself.  But
wherever homage to "dead men" be admitted, we may, even in our own
times, find that the most jocular legends are attached to names held
in the most reverential awe.  And he who has listened to an Irish or
an Italian Catholic's familiar stories of some favourite saint, may
form an adequate notion of the manner in which a pious Greek could
jest upon Bacchus to-day and sacrifice to Bacchus to-morrow.  With his
mythological travesties the Pythagorean mingled, apparently, many
earnest maxims of morality <a href="#note-324" name="noteref-324"><small>324</small></a>, and though not free, in the judgment
of Aristotle, from a vice of style usually common only to ages the
most refined <a href="#note-325" name="noteref-325"><small>325</small></a>; he was yet proverbial, even in the most polished
period of Grecian letters, for the graces of his diction and the happy
choice of his expressions.
</p>
<p>
Phormis, a contemporary of Epicharmus, flourished also at Syracuse,
and though sometimes classed with Epicharmus, and selecting his
materials from the same source, his claims to reputation are
immeasurably more equivocal.  Dinolochus continued the Sicilian
school, and was a contemporary of the first Athenian comic writer.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  Hence it will be seen that the origin of comedy does not rest
with the Athenians; that Megara, if the birthplace of Susarion, may
fairly claim whatever merit belongs to the first rude improvement, and
that Syracuse is entitled to the higher distinction of raising humour
into art.  So far is comedy the offspring of the Dorians&mdash;not the
Dorians of a sullen oligarchy, with whom to vary an air of music was a
crime&mdash;not the Dorians of Lacedaemon&mdash;but of Megara and Syracuse&mdash;of
an energetic, though irregular democracy&mdash;of a splendid, though
illegitimate monarchy. <a href="#note-326" name="noteref-326"><small>326</small></a>
</p>
<p>
But the comedy of Epicharmus was not altogether the old comedy of
Athens.  The last, as bequeathed to us by Aristophanes, has features
which bear little family resemblance to the philosophical parodies of
the Pythagorean poet.  It does not confine itself to mythological
subjects&mdash;it avoids the sententious style&mdash;it does not preach, but
ridicule philosophy&mdash;it plunges amid the great practical business of
men&mdash;it breathes of the Agora and the Piraeus&mdash;it is not a laughing
sage, but a bold, boisterous, gigantic demagogue, ever in the thickest
mob of human interests, and wielding all the various humours of a
democracy with a brilliant audacity, and that reckless ease which is
the proof of its astonishing power.
</p>
<p>
IX.  Chionides was the first Athenian comic writer.  We find him
before the public three years after the battle of Marathon (B. C.
487), when the final defeat of Hippias confirmed the stability of the
republic; and when the improvements of Aeschylus in tragedy served to
communicate new attractions to the comic stage.  Magnes, a writer of
great wit, and long popular, closely followed, and the titles of some
of the plays of these writers confirm the belief that Attic comedy,
from its commencement, took other ground than that occupied by the
mythological burlesques of Epicharmus.  So great was the impetus given
to the new art, that a crowd of writers followed simultaneously, whose
very names it is wearisome to mention.  Of these the most eminent were
Cratinus and Crates.  The earliest <i>recorded</i> play of Cratinus, though
he must have exhibited many before <a href="#note-327" name="noteref-327"><small>327</small></a>, appeared the year prior to
the death of Cimon (the Archilochi, B. C. 448).  Plutarch quotes some
lines from this author, which allude to the liberality of Cimon with
something of that patron-loving spirit which was rather the
characteristic of a Roman than an Athenian poet.  Though he himself,
despite his age, was proverbially of no very abstemious or decorous
habits, Cratinus was unsparing in his attacks upon others, and
wherever he found or suspected vice, he saw a subject worthy of his
genius.  He was admired to late posterity, and by Roman critics, for
the grace and even for the grandeur of his hardy verses; and
Quintilian couples him with Eupolis and Aristophanes as models for the
formation of orators.  Crates appeared (B. C. 451) two years before
the first <i>recorded</i> play of Cratinus.  He had previously been an
actor, and performed the principal characters in the plays of
Cratinus.  Aristophanes bestows on him the rare honour of his praise,
while he sarcastically reminds the Athenian audience of the ill
reception that so ingenious a poet often received at their hands.
Yet, despite the excellence of the earlier comic writers, they had
hitherto at Athens very sparingly adopted the artistical graces of
Epicharmus.  Crates, who did not write before the five years' truce
with Sparta, is said by Aristotle not only to have been the first who
abandoned the Iambic form of comedy, but the first Athenian who
invented systematic fable or plot&mdash;a strong argument to show how
little the Athenian borrowed from the Sicilian comedy, since, if the
last had been its source of inspiration, the invented stories of
Epicharmus (by half a century the predecessor of Crates) would
naturally have been the most striking improvement to be imitated.  The
Athenian comedy did not receive the same distinctions conferred upon
tragedy.  So obscure was its rise to its later eminence, that even
Aristotle could not determine when or by whom the various progressive
improvements were made: and, regarded with jealous or indifferent eyes
by the magistrature as an exhibition given by private competitors, nor
calling for the protection of the state, which it often defied, it was
long before its chorus was defrayed at the public cost.
</p>
<p>
Under Cratinus and Crates <a href="#note-328" name="noteref-328"><small>328</small></a>, however, in the year of the Samian
war, the comic drama assumed a character either so personally
scurrilous, or so politically dangerous, that a decree was passed
interdicting its exhibitions (B. C. 440).  The law was repealed
three years afterward (B. C. 437) <a href="#note-329" name="noteref-329"><small>329</small></a>.  Viewing its temporary
enforcement, and the date in which it was passed, it appears highly
probable that the critical events of the Samian expedition may have
been the cause of the decree.  At such a time the opposition of the
comic writers might have been considered dangerous.  With the
increased stability of the state, the law was, perhaps, deemed no
longer necessary.  And from the recommencement of the comic drama, we
may probably date both the improvements of Crates and the special
protection of the state; for when, for the first time, Comedy was
formally authorized by the law, it was natural that the law should
recognise the privileges it claimed in common with its sister Tragedy.
There is no authority for supposing that Pericles, whose calm temper
and long novitiate in the stormy career of public life seem to have
rendered him callous to public abuse, was the author of this decree.
It is highly probable, indeed, that he was absent at the siege of
Samos <a href="#note-330" name="noteref-330"><small>330</small></a> when it was passed; but he was the object of such virulent
attacks by the comic poets that we might consider them actuated by
some personal feeling of revenge and spleen, were it not evident that
Cratinus at least (and probably Crates, his disciple) was attached to
the memory of Cimon, and could not fail to be hostile to the
principles and government of Cimon's successor.  So far at this period
had comedy advanced; but, in the background, obscure and undreamed of,
was one, yet in childhood, destined to raise the comic to the rank of
the tragic muse; one who, perhaps, from his earliest youth, was
incited by the noisy fame of his predecessors, and the desire of that
glorious, but often perverted power, so palpable and so exultant,
which rides the stormy waves of popular applause <a href="#note-331" name="noteref-331"><small>331</small></a>.  About
thirteen years after the brief prohibition of comedy appeared that
wonderful genius, the elements and attributes of whose works it will
be a pleasing, if arduous task, in due season, to analyze and define;
matchless alike in delicacy and strength, in powers the most gigantic,
in purpose the most daring&mdash;with the invention of Shakspeare&mdash;the
playfulness of Rabelais&mdash;the malignity of Swift&mdash;need I add the name
of Aristophanes?
</p>
<p>
X.  But while comedy had thus progressed to its first invidious
dignity, that of proscription, far different was the reward that
awaited the present representative and master of the tragic school.
In the year that the muse of Cratinus was silenced, Sophocles was
appointed one of the colleagues with Pericles in the Samian war.

<h2>
    CHAPTER IV.
</h2>
<h3>
    The Tragedies of Sophocles.
</h3>
<p>
I.  It was in the very nature of the Athenian drama, that, when once
established, it should concentrate and absorb almost every variety of
the poetical genius.  The old lyrical poetry, never much cultivated in
Athens, ceased in a great measure when tragedy arose, or rather
tragedy was the complete development, the new and perfected
consummation of the Dithyrambic ode.  Lyrical poetry transmigrated
into the choral song, as the epic merged into the dialogue and plot,
of the drama.  Thus, when we speak of Athenian poetry, we speak of
dramatic poetry&mdash;they were one and the same.  As Helvetius has so
luminously shown <a href="#note-332" name="noteref-332"><small>332</small></a>, genius ever turns towards that quarter in
which fame shines brightest, and hence, in every age, there will be a
sympathetic connexion between the taste of the public and the
direction of the talent.
</p>
<p>
Now in Athens, where audiences were numerous and readers few, every
man who felt within himself the inspiration of the poet would
necessarily desire to see his poetry put into action&mdash;assisted with
all the pomp of spectacle and music, hallowed by the solemnity of a
religious festival, and breathed by artists elaborately trained to
heighten the eloquence of words into the reverent ear of assembled
Greece.
</p>
<p>
Hence the multitude of dramatic poets, hence the mighty fertility of
each; hence the life and activity of this&mdash;the comparative torpor and
barrenness of every other&mdash;species of poetry.  To add to the
pre-eminence of the art, the applauses of the many were sanctioned by
the critical canons of the few.  The drama was not only the most
alluring form which the Divine Spirit could assume&mdash;but it was also
deemed the loftiest and the purest; and when Aristotle ranked <a href="#note-333" name="noteref-333"><small>333</small></a> the
tragic higher than even the epic muse, he probably did but explain the
reasons for a preference which the generality of critics were disposed
to accord to her. <a href="#note-334" name="noteref-334"><small>334</small></a>
</p>
<p>
II.  The career of the most majestic of the Greek poets was eminently
felicitous.  His birth was noble, his fortune affluent; his natural
gifts were the rarest which nature bestows on man, genius and beauty.
All the care which the age permitted was lavished on his education.
For his feet even the ordinary obstacles in the path of distinction
were smoothed away.  He entered life under auspices the most
propitious and poetical.  At the age of sixteen he headed the youths
who performed the triumphant paean round the trophy of Salamis.  At
twenty-five, when the bones of Theseus were borne back to Athens in
the galley of the victorious Cimon, he exhibited his first play, and
won the prize from Aeschylus.  That haughty genius, whether indignant
at the success of a younger rival, or at a trial for impiety before
the Areopagus, to which (though acquitted) he was subjected, or at the
rapid ascendency of a popular party, that he seems to have scorned
with the disdain at once of an eupatrid and a Pythagorean, soon after
retired from Athens to the Syracusan court; and though he thence sent
some of his dramas to the Athenian stage <a href="#note-335" name="noteref-335"><small>335</small></a>, the absent veteran
could not but excite less enthusiasm than the young aspirant, whose
artful and polished genius was more in harmony with the reigning taste
than the vast but rugged grandeur of Aeschylus, who, perhaps from the
impossibility tangibly and visibly to body forth his shadowy Titans
and obscure sublimity of design, does not appear to have obtained a
popularity on the stage equal to his celebrity as a poet <a href="#note-336" name="noteref-336"><small>336</small></a>.  For
three-and-sixty years did Sophocles continue to exhibit; twenty times
he obtained the first prize, and he is said never to have been
degraded to the third.  The ordinary persecutions of envy itself seem
to have spared this fortunate poet.  Although his moral character was
far from pure <a href="#note-337" name="noteref-337"><small>337</small></a>, and even in extreme old age he sought after the
pleasures of his youth <a href="#note-338" name="noteref-338"><small>338</small></a>, yet his excesses apparently met with a
remarkable indulgence from his contemporaries.  To him were known
neither the mortifications of Aeschylus nor the relentless mockery
heaped upon Euripides.  On his fair name the terrible Aristophanes
himself affixes no brand <a href="#note-339" name="noteref-339"><small>339</small></a>.  The sweetness of his genius extended
indeed to his temper, and personal popularity assisted his public
triumphs.  Nor does he appear to have keenly shared the party
animosities of his day; his serenity, like that of Goethe, has in it
something of enviable rather than honourable indifference.  He owed
his first distinction to Cimon, and he served afterward under
Pericles; on his entrance into life, he led the youths that circled
the trophy of Grecian freedom&mdash;and on the verge of death, we shall
hereafter see him calmly assent to the surrender of Athenian
liberties.  In short, Aristophanes perhaps mingled more truth than
usual with his wit, when even in the shades below he says of
Sophocles, "He was contented here&mdash;he's contented there."  A
disposition thus facile, united with an admirable genius, will, not
unoften, effect a miracle, and reconcile prosperity with fame. <a href="#note-340" name="noteref-340"><small>340</small></a>
</p>
<p>
At the age of fifty-seven, Sophocles was appointed, as I before said
<a href="#note-341" name="noteref-341"><small>341</small></a>, to a command, as one of the ten generals in the Samian war; but
history is silent as to his military genius <a href="#note-342" name="noteref-342"><small>342</small></a>.  In later life we
shall again have occasion to refer to him, condemned as he was to
illustrate (after a career of unprecedented brilliancy&mdash;nor ever
subjected to the caprice of the common public) the melancholy moral
inculcated by himself <a href="#note-343" name="noteref-343"><small>343</small></a>, and so often obtruded upon us by the
dramatists of his country, "never to deem a man happy till death
itself denies the hazard of reverses."  Out of the vast, though not
accurately known, number of the dramas of Sophocles, seven remain.
</p>
<p>
III.  A great error has been committed by those who class Aeschylus
and Sophocles together as belonging to the same era, and refer both to
the age of Pericles, because each was living while Pericles was in
power.  We may as well class Dr. Johnson and Lord Byron in the same
age, because both lived in the reign of George III.  The Athenian
rivals were formed under the influences of very different generations;
and if Aeschylus lived through a considerable portion of the career of
the younger Sophocles, the accident of longevity by no means warrants
us to consider then the children of the same age&mdash;the creatures of the
same influences.  Aeschylus belonged to the race and the period from
which emerged Themistocles and Aristides&mdash;Sophocles to those which
produced Phidias and Pericles.  Sophocles indeed, in the calmness of
his disposition, and the symmetry and stateliness of his genius, might
almost be entitled the Pericles of poetry.  And as the statesman was
called the Olympian, not from the headlong vehemence, but the serene
majesty of his strength; so of Sophocles also it may be said, that his
power is visible in his repose, and his thunders roll from the depth
of a clear sky.
</p>
<p>
IV.  The age of Pericles is the age of art <a href="#note-344" name="noteref-344"><small>344</small></a>.  It was not
Sophocles alone that was an artist in that time; he was but one of the
many who, in every department, sought, in study and in science, the
secrets of the wise or the beautiful.  Pericles and Phidias were in
their several paths of fame what Sophocles was in his.  But it was not
the art of an emasculate or effeminate period&mdash;it grew out of the
example of a previous generation of men astonishingly great.  It was
art still fresh from the wells of nature.  Art with a vast field yet
unexplored, and in all its youthful vigour and maiden enthusiasm.
There was, it is true, at a period a little later than that in which
the genius of Sophocles was formed, one class of students among whom a
false taste and a spurious refinement were already visible&mdash;the class
of rhetoricians and philosophical speculators.  For, in fact, the art
which belongs to the imagination is often purest in an early age; but
that which appertains to the reason and intellect is slow before it
attains mature strength and manly judgment, Among these students was
early trained and tutored the thoughtful mind of Euripides; and hence
that art which in Sophocles was learned in more miscellaneous and
active circles, and moulded by a more powerful imagination, in
Euripides often sickens us with the tricks of a pleader, the quibbles
of a schoolman, or the dullness of a moralizing declaimer.  But as, in
the peculiar attributes and character of his writings, Euripides
somewhat forestalled his age&mdash;as his example had a very important
influence upon his successors&mdash;as he did not exhibit till the fame of
Sophocles was already confirmed&mdash;and as his name is intimately
associated with the later age of Aristophanes and Socrates&mdash;it may be
more convenient to confine our critical examination at present to the
tragedies of Sophocles.
</p>
<p>
Although the three plays of the "Oedipus Tyrannus," the "Oedipus at
Coloneus," and the "Antigone," were  composed and exhibited at very
wide intervals of time, yet, from their connexion with each other,
they may almost be said to form one poem.  The "Antigone," which
concludes the story, was the one earliest written; and there are
passages in either "Oedipus" which seem composed to lead up, as it
were, to the catastrophe of the "Antigone," and form a harmonious link
between the several dramas.  These three plays constitute, on the
whole, the greatest performance of Sophocles, though in detached parts
they are equalled by passages in the "Ajax" and the "Philoctetes."
</p>
<p>
V.  The "Oedipus Tyrannus" opens thus.  An awful pestilence devastates
Thebes.  Oedipus, the king, is introduced to us, powerful and beloved;
to him whose wisdom had placed him on the throne, look up the priest
and the suppliants for a remedy even amid the terrors of the plague.
Oedipus informs them that he has despatched Creon (the brother of his
wife Jocasta) to the Pythian god to know by what expiatory deed the
city might be delivered from its curse.  Scarce has he concluded, when
Creon himself enters, and announces "glad tidings" in the explicit
answer of the oracle.  The god has declared&mdash;that a pollution had been
bred in the land, and must be expelled the city&mdash;that Laius, the
former king, had been murdered&mdash;and that his blood must be avenged.
Laius had left the city never to return; of his train but one man
escaped to announce his death by assassins.  Oedipus instantly
resolves to prosecute the inquiry into the murder, and orders the
people to be summoned.  The suppliants arise from the altar, and a
solemn chorus of the senators of Thebes (in one of the most splendid
lyrics of Sophocles) chant the terrors of the plague&mdash;"that unarmed
Mars"&mdash;and implore the protection of the divine averters of
destruction.  Oedipus then, addressing the chorus, demands their aid
to discover the murderer, whom he solemnly excommunicates, and dooms,
deprived of aid and intercourse, to waste slowly out a miserable
existence; nay, if the assassin should have sought refuge in the royal
halls, there too shall the vengeance be wreaked and the curse fall.
</p>
<p>
"For I," continued Oedipus,
</p>
<pre>
    "I, who the sceptre which he wielded wield;
     I, who have mounted to his marriage bed;
     I, in whose children (had he issue known)
     His would have claimed a common brotherhood;
     Now that the evil fate bath fallen o'er him&mdash;
     I am the heir of that dead king's revenge,
     Not less than if these lips had hailed him 'father!'"
</pre>
<p>
A few more sentences introduce to us the old soothsayer Tiresias&mdash;for
whom, at the instigation of Creon, Oedipus had sent.  The seer answers
the adjuration of the king with a thrilling and ominous burst&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "Wo&mdash;wo!&mdash;how fearful is the gift of wisdom,
     When to the wise it bears no blessing!&mdash;wo!"
</pre>
<p>
The haughty spirit of Oedipus breaks forth at the gloomy and obscure
warnings of the prophet.  His remonstrances grow into threats.  In his
blindness he even accuses Tiresias himself of the murder of Laius&mdash;and
out speaks the terrible diviner:
</p>
<pre>
    "Ay&mdash;is it so?  Abide then by thy curse
     And solemn edict&mdash;never from this day
     Hold human commune with these men or me;
     Lo, where thou standest&mdash;lo, the land's polluter!"
</pre>
<p>
A dialogue of great dramatic power ensues.  Oedipus accuses Tiresias
of abetting his kinsman, Creon, by whom he had been persuaded to send
for the soothsayer, in a plot against his throne&mdash;and the seer, who
explains nothing and threatens all things, departs with a dim and
fearful prophecy.
</p>
<p>
After a song from the chorus, in which are imbodied the doubt, the
trouble, the terror which the audience may begin to feel&mdash;and here it
may be observed, that with Sophocles the chorus always carries on, not
the physical, but the moral, progress of the drama <a href="#note-345" name="noteref-345"><small>345</small></a>&mdash;Creon
enters, informed of the suspicion against himself which Oedipus had
expressed.  Oedipus, whose whole spirit is disturbed by the weird and
dark threats of Tiresias, repeats the accusation, but wildly and
feebly.  His vain worldly wisdom suggests to him that Creon would
scarcely have asked him to consult Tiresias, nor Tiresias have
ventured on denunciations so tremendous, had not the two conspired
against him: yet a mysterious awe invades him&mdash;he presses questions on
Creon relative to the murder of Laius, and seems more anxious to
acquit himself than accuse another.
</p>
<p>
While the princes contend, the queen, Jocasta, enters.  She chides
their quarrel, learns from Oedipus that Tiresias had accused him of
the murder of the deceased king, and, to convince him of the falseness
of prophetic lore, reveals to him, that long since it was predicted
that Laius should be murdered by his son joint offspring of Jocasta
and himself.  Yet, in order to frustrate the prophecy, the only son of
Laius had been exposed to perish upon solitary and untrodden
mountains, while, in after years, Laius himself had fallen, in a spot
where three roads met, by the hand of a stranger; so that the prophecy
had not come to pass.
</p>
<p>
At this declaration terror seizes upon Oedipus.  He questions Jocasta
eagerly and rapidly&mdash;the place where the murder happened, the time in
which it occurred, the age and personal appearance of Laius&mdash;and when
he learns all, his previous arrogant conviction of innocence deserts
him; and as he utters a horrid exclamation, Jocasta fixes her eyes
upon him, and "shudders as she gazes." <a href="#note-346" name="noteref-346"><small>346</small></a>  He inquires what train
accompanied Laius&mdash;learns that there were five persons; that but one
escaped; that on his return to Thebes, seeing Oedipus on the throne,
the surviver had besought the favour to retire from the city.  Oedipus
orders this witness of the murder to be sent for, and then proceeds to
relate his own history.  He has been taught to believe that Polybus of
Corinth and Merope of Doris were his parents.  But once at a banquet
he was charged with being a supposititious child; the insult galled
him, and he went to Delphi to consult the oracle.  It was predicted to
him that he should commit incest with his mother, and that his father
should fall by his hand.  Appalled and horror-stricken, he resolves to
fly the possible fulfilment of the prophecy, and return no more to
Corinth.  In his flight by the triple road described by Jocasta he
meets an old man in a chariot, with a guide or herald, and other
servitors.  They attempt to thrust him from the road&mdash;a contest
ensues&mdash;he slays the old man and his train.  Could this be Laius?  Can
it be to the marriage couch of the man he slew that he has ascended?
No, his fears are too credulous! he clings to a straw; the herdsman
who had escaped the slaughter of Laius and his attendants may prove
that it was <i>not</i> the king whom he encountered.  Jocasta sustains this
hope&mdash;she cannot believe a prophecy&mdash;for it had been foretold that
Laius should fall by the hand of his son, and that son had long since
perished on the mountains.  The queen and Oedipus retire within their
palace; the chorus resume their strains; after which, Jocasta
reappears on her way to the temple of Apollo, to offer sacrifice and
prayer.  At this time a messenger arrives to announce to Oedipus the
death of Polybus, and the wish of the Corinthians to elect Oedipus to
the throne!  At these tidings Jocasta is overjoyed.
</p>
<pre>
    "Predictions of the gods, where are ye now?
     Lest by the son's doomed hand the sire should fall,
     The son became a wanderer on the earth,
     Lo, not the son, but Nature, gives the blow!"
</pre>
<p>
Oedipus, summoned to the messenger, learns the news of his supposed
father's death!  It is a dread and tragic thought, but the pious
Oedipus is glad that his father is no more, since he himself is thus
saved from parricide; yet the other part of the prediction haunts him.
His mother!&mdash;she yet lives.  He reveals to the messenger the prophecy
and his terror.  To cheer him, the messenger now informs him that he
is not the son of Merope and Polybus.  A babe had been found in the
entangled forest-dells of Cithaeron by a herdsman and slave of Laius
&mdash;he had given the infant to another&mdash;that other, the messenger who
now tells the tale.  Transferred to the care of Polybus and Merope,
the babe became to them as a son, for they were childless.  Jocasta
hears&mdash;stunned and speechless&mdash;till Oedipus, yet unconscious of the
horrors still to come, turns to demand of her if she knew the herdsman
who had found the child.  Then she gasps wildly out&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "Whom speaks he of?  Be silent&mdash;heed it not&mdash;
     Blot it out from thy memory!&mdash;it is evil!
       Oedipus.  It cannot be&mdash;the clew is here; and I
     Will trace it through that labyrinth&mdash;my birth.
       Jocasta.  By all the gods I warn thee; for the sake
     Of thine own life beware; it is enough
     For me to hear and madden!"
</pre>
<p>
Oedipus (suspecting only that the pride of his queen revolts from the
thought of her husband's birth being proved base and servile) replies,
</p>
<pre>
                          "Nay, nay, cheer thee!
     Were I through three descents threefold a slave,
     My shame would not touch thee.
       Jocasta.                 I do implore thee,
     This once obey me&mdash;this once.
       Oedipus              I will not!
     To truth I grope my way.
       Jocasta.        And yet what love
     Speaks in my voice!  Thine ignorance is thy bliss.
       Oedipus.  A bliss that tortures!
       Jocasta.                         Miserable man!
     Oh couldst thou never learn the thing thou art!
       Oedipus.  Will no one quicken this slow herdsman's steps
     The unquestioned birthright of a royal name
     Let this proud queen possess!
       Jocasta.                    Wo! wo! thou wretch!
     Wo! my last word!&mdash;words are no more for me!"
</pre>
<p>
With this Jocasta rushes from the scene.  Still Oedipus misconstrues
her warning; he ascribes her fears to the royalty of her spirit.  For
himself, Fortune was his mother, and had blessed him; nor could the
accident of birth destroy his inheritance from nature.  The chorus
give way to their hopes! their wise, their glorious Oedipus might have
been born a Theban!  The herdsman enters: like Tiresias, he is loath
to speak.  The fiery king extorts his secret.  Oedipus is the son of
Laius and Jocasta&mdash;at his birth the terrible prophecies of the Pythian
induced his own mother to expose him on the mountains&mdash;the compassion
of the herdsman saved him&mdash;saved him to become the bridegroom of his
mother, the assassin of his sire.  The astonishing art with which,
from step to step, the audience and the victim are led to the climax
of the discovery, is productive of an interest of pathos and of terror
which is not equalled by the greatest masterpieces of the modern stage
<a href="#note-347" name="noteref-347"><small>347</small></a>, and possesses that species of anxious excitement which is
wholly unparalleled in the ancient.  The discovery is a true
catastrophe&mdash;the physical denouement is but an adjunct to the moral
one.  Jocasta, on quitting the scene, had passed straight to the
bridal-chamber, and there, by the couch from which had sprung a double
and accursed progeny, perished by her own hands.  Meanwhile, the
predestined parricide, bursting into the chamber, beheld, as the last
object on earth, the corpse of his wife and mother!  Once more Oedipus
reappears, barred for ever from the light of day.  In the fury of his
remorse, he "had smote the balls of his own eyes," and the wise
baffler of the sphinx, Oedipus, the haughty, the insolent, the
illustrious, is a forlorn and despairing outcast.  But amid all the
horror of the concluding scene, a beautiful and softening light breaks
forth.  Blind, powerless, excommunicated, Creon, whom Oedipus accused
of murder, has now become his judge and his master.  The great spirit,
crushed beneath its intolerable woes, is humbled to the dust; and the
"wisest of mankind" implores but two favours&mdash;to be thrust from the
land an exile, and once more to embrace his children.  Even in
translation the exquisite tenderness of this passage cannot altogether
fail of its effect.
</p>
<pre>
    "For my fate, let it pass!  My children, Creon!
     My sons&mdash;nay, they the bitter wants of life
     May master&mdash;they are MEN?&mdash;my girls&mdash;my darlings&mdash;
     Why, never sat I at my household board
     Without their blessed looks&mdash;our very bread
     We brake together; thou'lt be kind to them
     For my sake, Creon&mdash;and (oh, latest prayer!)
     Let me but touch them&mdash;feel them with these hands,
     And pour such sorrow as may speak farewell
     O'er ills that must be theirs!  By thy pure line&mdash;
     For thin is pure&mdash;do this, sweet prince.  Methinks
     I should not miss these eyes, could I but touch them.
     What shall I say to move thee?
                                     Sobs!  And do I,
     Oh do I hear my sweet ones?  Hast thou sent,
     In mercy sent, my children to my arms?
     Speak&mdash;speak&mdash;I do not dream!
       Creon.                       They are thy children;
     I would not shut thee from the dear delight
     In the old time they gave thee.
       Oedipus.                       Blessings on thee
     For this one mercy mayst thou find above
     A kinder God than I have.  Ye&mdash;where are ye?
     My children&mdash;come!&mdash;nearer and nearer yet," etc.
</pre>
<p>
The pathos of this scene is continued to the end; and the very last
words Oedipus utters as his children cling to him, implore that they
at least may not be torn away.
</p>
<p>
It is in this concluding scene that the art of the play is
consummated; the horrors of the catastrophe, which, if a last
impression, would have left behind a too painful and gloomy feeling,
are softened down by this beautiful resort to the tenderest and
holiest sources of emotion.  And the pathos is rendered doubly
effective, not only from the immediate contrast of the terror that
preceded it, but from the masterly skill with which all display of the
softer features in the character of Oedipus is reserved to the close.
In the breaking up of the strong mind and the daring spirit, when
empire, honour, name, are all annihilated, the heart is seen, as it
were, surviving the wrecks around it, and clinging for support to the
affections.
</p>
<p>
VII.  In the "Oedipus at Coloneus," the blind king is presented to us,
after the lapse of years, a wanderer over the earth, unconsciously
taking his refuge in the grove of the furies <a href="#note-348" name="noteref-348"><small>348</small></a>&mdash;"the awful
goddesses, daughters of Earth and Darkness."  His young daughter,
Antigone, one of the most lovely creations of poetry, is his companion
and guide; he is afterward joined by his other daughter, Ismene, whose
weak and selfish character is drawn in strong contrast to the heroism
and devotion of Antigone.  The ancient prophecies that foretold his
woes had foretold also his release.  His last shelter and
resting-place were to be obtained from the dread deities, and a sign of
thunder, or earthquake, or lightning was to announce his parting hour.
Learning the spot to which his steps had been guided, Oedipus solemnly
feels that his doom approaches: thus, at the very opening of the poem,
he stands before us on the verge of a mysterious grave.
</p>
<p>
The sufferings which have bowed the parricide to a premature old age
<a href="#note-349" name="noteref-349"><small>349</small></a> have not crushed his spirit; the softness and self-humiliation
which were the first results of his awful affliction are passed away.
He is grown once more vehement and passionate, from the sense of
wrong; remorse still visits him, but is alternated with the yet more
human feeling of resentment at the unjust severity of his doom <a href="#note-350" name="noteref-350"><small>350</small></a>.
His sons, who, "by a word," might have saved him from the expulsion,
penury, and wanderings he has undergone, had deserted his cause&mdash;had
looked with indifferent eyes on his awful woes&mdash;had joined with Creon
to expel him from the Theban land.  They are the Goneril and Regan of
the classic Lear, as Antigone is the Cordelia on whom he leans&mdash;a
Cordelia he has never thrust from him.  "When," says Oedipus, in stern
bitterness of soul,
</p>
<pre>
    "When my soul boiled within me&mdash;when 'to die'
     Was all my prayer&mdash;and death was sweetness, yea,
     Had they but stoned me like a dog, I'd blessed them;
     Then no man rose against me&mdash;but when time
     Brought its slow comfort&mdash;when my wounds were scarred&mdash;
     All my griefs mellow'd, and remorse itself
     Judged my self-penance mightier than my sins,
     Thebes thrust me from her breast, and they, my sons,
     My blood, mine offspring, from their father shrunk:
     A word of theirs had saved me&mdash;one small word&mdash;
     They said it not&mdash;and lo! the wandering beggar!"
</pre>
<p>
In the mean while, during the exile of Oedipus, strife had broken out
between the brothers: Eteocles, here represented as the younger, drove
out Polynices, and seized the throne; Polynices takes refuge at Argos,
where he prepares war against the usurper: an oracle declares that
success shall be with that party which Oedipus joins, and a mysterious
blessing is pronounced on the land which contains his bones.  Thus,
the possession of this wild tool of fate&mdash;raised up in age to a dread
and ghastly consequence&mdash;becomes the argument of the play, as his
death must become the catastrophe.  It is the deep and fierce revenge
of Oedipus that makes the passion of the whole.  According to a
sublime conception, we see before us the physical Oedipus in the
lowest state of destitution and misery&mdash;in rags, blindness, beggary,
utter and abject impotence.  But in the moral, Oedipus is all the
majesty of a power still royal.  The oracle has invested one, so
fallen and so wretched in himself, with the power of a god&mdash;the power
to confer victory on the cause he adopts, prosperity on the land that
becomes his tomb.  With all the revenge of age, all the grand
malignity of hatred, he clings to this shadow and relic of a sceptre.
Creon, aware of the oracle, comes to recall him to Thebes.  The
treacherous kinsman humbles himself before his victim&mdash;he is the
suppliant of the beggar, who defies and spurns him.  Creon avenges
himself by seizing on Antigone and Ismene.  Nothing can be more
dramatically effective than the scene in which these last props of his
age are torn from the desolate old man.  They are ultimately restored
to him by Theseus, whose amiable and lofty character is painted with
all the partial glow of colouring which an Athenian poet would
naturally lavish on the Athenian Alfred.  We are next introduced to
Polynices.  He, like Creon, has sought Oedipus with the selfish motive
of recovering his throne by means of an ally to whom the oracle
promises victory.  But there is in Polynices the appearance of a true
penitence, and a mingled gentleness and majesty in his bearing which
interests us in his fate despite his faults, and which were possibly
intended by Sophocles to give a new interest to the plot of the
"Antigone," composed and exhibited long before.  Oedipus is persuaded
by the benevolence of Theseus, and the sweet intercession of Antigone,
to admit his son.  After a chant from the chorus on the ills of old
age <a href="#note-351" name="noteref-351"><small>351</small></a>, Polynices enters.  He is struck with the wasted and
miserable appearance of the old man, and bitterly reproaches his own
desertion.
</p>
<p>
"But since," he says, with almost a Christian sentiment&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "Since o'er each deed, upon the Olympian throne,
     Mercy sits joint presider with great Jove,
     Let her, oh father, also take her stand
     Within thy soul&mdash;and judge me!  The past sins
     Yet have their cure&mdash;ah, would they had recall!
     Why are you voiceless?  Speak to me, my father?
     Turn not away&mdash;will you not answer me?" etc.
</pre>
<p>
Oedipus retains his silence in spite of the prayers of his beloved
Antigone, and Polynices proceeds to narrate the wrongs he has
undergone from Eteocles, and, warming with a young warrior's ardour,
paints the array that he has mustered on his behalf&mdash;promises to
restore Oedipus to his palace&mdash;and, alluding to the oracle, throws
himself on his father's pardon.
</p>
<p>
Then, at last, outspeaks Oedipus, and from reproach bursts into
curses.
</p>
<pre>
    "And now you weep; you wept not at these woes
     Until you wept your own.  But I&mdash;I weep not.
     These things are not for tears, but for Endurance.
     My son is like his sire&mdash;a parricide!
     Toil, exile, beggary&mdash;daily bread doled out
     From stranger hands&mdash;these are your gifts, my son!
     My nurses, guardians&mdash;they who share the want,
     Or earn the bread, are daughters; call them not
     Women, for they to me are men.  Go to!
     Thou art not mine&mdash;I do disclaim such issue.
     Behold, the eyes of the avenging God
     Are o'er thee! but their ominous light delays
     To blast thee yet.  March on&mdash;march on&mdash;to Thebes!
     Not&mdash;not for thee, the city and the throne;
     The earth shall first be reddened with thy blood&mdash;
     Thy blood and his, thy foe&mdash;thy brother!  Curses!
     Not for the first time summoned to my wrongs&mdash;
     Curses!  I call ye back, and make ye now
     Allies with this old man!

          *     *     *     *     *     *

     Yea, curses shall possess thy seat and throne,
     If antique Justice o'er the laws of earth
     Reign with the thunder-god.  March on to ruin!
     Spurned and disowned&mdash;the basest of the base&mdash;
     And with thee bear this burden: o'er thine head
     I pour a prophet's doom; nor throne nor home
     Waits on the sharpness of the levelled spear:
     Thy very land of refuge hath no welcome;
     Thine eyes have looked their last on hollow Argos.
     Death by a brother's hand&mdash;dark fratricide,
     Murdering thyself a brother&mdash;shall be thine.
     Yea, while I curse thee, on the murky deep
     Of the primeval hell I call!  Prepare
     These men their home, dread Tartarus!  Goddesses,
     Whose shrines are round me&mdash;ye avenging Furies!
     And thou, oh Lord of Battle, who hast stirred
     Hate in the souls of brethren, hear me&mdash;hear me!&mdash;
     And now, 'tis past!&mdash;enough!&mdash;depart and tell
     The Theban people, and thy fond allies,
     What blessings, from his refuge with the Furies,
     The blind old Oedipus awards his sons!" <a href="#note-352" name="noteref-352"><small>352</small></a>
</pre>
<p>
As is usual with Sophocles, the terrific strength of these execrations
is immediately followed by a soft and pathetic scene between Antigone
and her brother.  Though crushed at first by the paternal curse, the
spirit of Polynices so far recovers its native courage that he will
not listen to the prayer of his sister to desist from the expedition
to Thebes, and to turn his armies back to Argos.  "What," he says,
</p>
<pre>
    "Lead back an army that could deem I trembled!"
</pre>
<p>
Yet he feels the mournful persuasion that his death is doomed; and a
glimpse of the plot of the "Antigone" is opened upon us by his prayer
to his sister, that if he perish, they should lay him with due honours
in the tomb.  The exquisite loveliness of Antigone's character touches
even Polynices, and he departs, saying,
</p>
<pre>
    "With the gods rests the balance of our fate;
     But thee, at least&mdash;oh never upon thee
     May evil fall!  Thou art too good for sorrow!"
</pre>
<p>
The chorus resume their strains, when suddenly thunder is heard, and
Oedipus hails the sign that heralds him to the shades.  Nothing can be
conceived more appalling than this omen.  It seems as if Oedipus had
been spared but to curse his children and to die.  He summons Theseus,
tells him that his fate is at hand, and that without a guide he
himself will point out the spot where he shall rest.  Never may that
spot be told&mdash;that secret and solemn grave shall be the charm of the
land and a defence against its foes.  Oedipus then turns round, and
the instinct within guides him as he gropes along.  His daughters and
Theseus follow the blind man, amazed and awed.  "Hither," he says,
</p>
<pre>
    "Hither&mdash;by this way come&mdash;for this way leads
     The unseen conductor of the dead <a href="#note-353" name="noteref-353"><small>353</small></a>&mdash;and she
     Whom shadows call their queen! <a href="#note-354" name="noteref-354"><small>354</small></a>  Oh light, sweet light,
     Rayless to me&mdash;mine once, and even now
     I feel thee palpable, round this worn form,
     Clinging in last embrace&mdash;I go to shroud
     The waning life in the eternal Hades!"
</pre>
<p>
Thus the stage is left to the chorus, and the mysterious fate of
Oedipus is recited by the Nuntius, in verses which Longinus has not
extolled too highly.  Oedipus had led the way to a cavern, well known
in legendary lore as the spot where Perithous and Theseus had pledged
their faith, by the brazen steps which make one of the entrances to
the infernal realms;
</p>
<pre>
    "Between which place and the Thorician stone&mdash;
     The hollow thorn, and the sepulchral pile
     He sat him down."
</pre>
<p>
And when he had performed libations from the stream, and laved, and
decked himself in the funeral robes, Jove thundered beneath the earth,
and the old man's daughters, aghast with horror, fell at his knees
with sobs and groans.
</p>
<pre>
    "Then o'er them as they wept, his hands he clasped,
     And 'Oh my children,' said he, 'from this day
     Ye have no more a father&mdash;all of me
     Withers away&mdash;the burden and the toil
     Of mine old age fall on ye nevermore.
     Sad travail have ye home for me, and yet
     Let one thought breathe a balm when I am gone&mdash;
     The thought that none upon the desolate world
     Loved you as I did; and in death I leave
     A happier life to you!'

                                    Thus movingly,
     With clinging arms and passionate sobs, the three
     Wept out aloud, until the sorrow grew
     Into a deadly hush&mdash;nor cry nor wail
     Starts the drear silence of the solitude.
     Then suddenly a bodiless voice is heard
     And fear came cold on all.  They shook with awe,
     And horror, like a wind, stirred up their hair.
     Again, the voice&mdash;again&mdash;'Ho! Oedipus, Why linger we so long?
     Come&mdash;hither&mdash;come.'"
</pre>
<p>
Oedipus then solemnly consigns his children to Theseus, dismisses
them, and Theseus alone is left with the old man.
</p>
<pre>
    "So groaning we depart&mdash;and when once more
     We turned our eyes to gaze, behold, the place
     Knew not the man!  The king alone was there,
     Holding his spread hands o'er averted brows
     As if to shut from out the quailing gaze
     The horrid aspect of some ghastly thing
     That nature durst not look on.  So we paused
     Until the king awakened from the terror,
     And to the mother Earth, and high Olympus,
     Seat of the gods, he breathed awe&mdash;stricken prayer
     But, how the old man perished, save the king,
     Mortal can ne'er divine; for bolt, nor levin,
     Nor blasting tempest from the ocean borne,
     Was heard or seen; but either was he rapt
     Aloft by wings divine, or else the shades,
     Whose darkness never looked upon the sun,
     Yawned in grim mercy, and the rent abyss
     Ingulf'd the wanderer from the living world."
</pre>
<p>
Such, sublime in its wondrous power, its appalling mystery, its dim,
religious terror, is the catastrophe of the "Oedipus at Coloneus."
The lines that follow are devoted to the lamentations of the
daughters, and appear wholly superfluous, unless we can consider that
Sophocles desired to indicate the connexion of the "Oedipus" with the
"Antigone," by informing us that the daughters of Oedipus are to be
sent to Thebes at the request of Antigone herself, who hopes, in the
tender courage of her nature, that she may perhaps prevent the
predicted slaughter of her brothers.
</p>
<p>
VII.  Coming now to the tragedy of "Antigone," we find the prophecy of
Oedipus has been fulfilled&mdash;the brothers have fallen by the hand of
each other&mdash;the Argive army has been defeated&mdash;Creon has obtained the
tyranny, and interdicts, on the penalty of death, the burial of
Polynices, whose corpse remains guarded and unhonoured.  Antigone,
mindful of her brother's request to her in their last interview,
resolves to brave the edict, and perform those rites so indispensably
sacred in the eyes of a Greek.  She communicates her resolution to her
sister Ismene, whose character, still feeble and commonplace, is a
perpetual foil to the heroism of Antigone.  She acts upon her
resolutions, baffles the vigilant guards, buries the corpse.  Creon,
on learning that his edict has been secretly disobeyed, orders the
remains to be disinterred, and in a second attempt Antigone is
discovered, brought before him, and condemned to death.  Haemon, the
son of Creon, had been affianced to Antigone.  On the news of her
sentence he seeks Creon, and after a violent scene between the two,
which has neither the power nor the dignity common to Sophocles,
departs with vague menaces.  A short but most exquisite invocation to
love from the chorus succeeds, and in this, it may be observed, the
chorus express much left not represented in the action&mdash;they serve to
impress on the spectator all the irresistible effects of the passion
which the modern artist would seek to represent in some moving scene
between Antigone and Haemon.  The heroine herself now passes across
the stage on her way to her dreadful doom, which is that of living
burial in "the cavern of a rock."  She thus addresses the chorus&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
    "Ye, of the land wherein my fathers dwelt,
     Behold me journeying to my latest bourne!
     Time hath no morrow for these eyes.  Black Orcus,
     Whose court hath room for all, leads my lone steps,
     E'en while I live, to shadows.  Not for me
     The nuptial blessing or the marriage hymn:
     Acheron, receive thy bride!
       (Chorus.)                  Honoured and mourned
     Nor struck by slow disease or violent hand,
     Thy steps glide to the grave!  Self-judged, like Freedom, <a href="#note-355" name="noteref-355"><small>355</small></a>
     Thou, above mortals gifted, shalt descend
     All living to the shades.
       Antigone.                Methinks I have heard&mdash;
     So legends go&mdash;how Phrygian Niobe
     (Poor stranger) on the heights of Sipylus
     Mournfully died.  The hard rock, like the tendrils
     O' the ivy, clung and crept unto her heart&mdash;
     Her, nevermore, dissolving into showers,
     Pale snows desert; and from her sorrowful eyes,
     As from unfailing founts adown the cliffs,
     Fall the eternal dews.  Like her, the god
     Lulls me to sleep, and into stone!"
</pre>
<p>
Afterward she adds in her beautiful lament, "That she has one comfort
&mdash;that she shall go to the grave dear to her parents and her brother."
</p>
<p>
The grief of Antigone is in perfect harmony with her character&mdash;it
betrays no repentance, no weakness&mdash;it is but the natural sorrow, of
youth and womanhood, going down to that grave which had so little of
hope in the old Greek religion.  In an Antigone on our stage we might
have demanded more reference to her lover; but the Grecian heroine
names him not, and alludes rather to the loss of the woman's lot of
wedlock than the loss of the individual bridegroom.  But it is not for
that reason that we are to conclude, with M. Schlegel and others, that
the Greek women knew not the sentiment of love.  Such a notion, that
has obtained an unaccountable belief, I shall hereafter show to be at
variance with all the poetry of the Greeks&mdash;with their drama itself&mdash;
with their modes of life&mdash;and with the very elements of that human
nature, which is everywhere the same.  But Sophocles, in the character
of Antigone, personifies duty, not passion.  It is to this, her
leading individuality, that whatever might weaken the pure and
statue-like effect of the creation is sacrificed.  As she was to her
father, so is she to her brother.  The sorrows and calamities of her
family have so endeared them to her heart that she has room for little
else. "Formed," as she exquisitely says of herself, "to love, not to
hate," <a href="#note-356" name="noteref-356"><small>356</small></a> she lives but to devote affections the most sacred to sad
and pious tasks, and the last fulfilled, she has done with earth.
</p>
<p>
When Antigone is borne away, an august personage is presented to us,
whose very name to us, who usually read the Oedipus Tyrannus before
the Antigone, is the foreteller of omen and doom.  As in the Oedipus
Tyrannus, Tiresias the soothsayer appears to announce all the terrors
that ensue&mdash;so now, at the crowning desolation of that fated house,
he, the solemn and mysterious surviver of such dark tragedies, is
again brought upon the stage.  The auguries have been evil&mdash;birds
battle with each other in the air&mdash;the flame will not mount from the
sacrificial victim&mdash;and the altars and hearths are full of birds and
dogs, gathering to their feast on the corpse of Polynices.  The
soothsayer enjoins Creon not to war against the dead, and to accord
the rites of burial to the prince's body.  On the obstinate refusal of
Creon, Tiresias utters prophetic maledictions and departs.  Creon,
whose vehemence of temper is combined with a feeble character, and
strongly contrasts the mighty spirit of Oedipus, repents, and is
persuaded by the chorus to release Antigone from her living prison, as
well as to revoke the edict which denies sepulture to Polynices.  He
quits the stage for that purpose, and the chorus burst into one of
their most picturesque odes, an Invocation to Bacchus, thus
inadequately presented to the English reader.

    "Oh thou, whom earth by many a title hails,

       Maddening, with mystic dance, the solemn midnight long!"
</pre>
<p>
At the close of the chorus the Nuntius enters to announce the
catastrophe, and Eurydice, the wife of Creon, disturbed by rumours
within her palace, is made an auditor of the narration.  Creon and his
train, after burying Polynices, repair to the cavern in which Antigone
had been immured.  They hear loud wailings within "that unconsecrated
chamber"&mdash;it is the voice of Haemon.  Creon recoils&mdash;the attendants
enter&mdash;within the cavern they behold Antigone, who, in the horror of
that deathlike solitude, had strangled herself with the zone of her
robe; and there was her lover lying beside, his arms clasped around
her waist.  Creon at length advances, perceives his son, and conjures
him to come forth.
</p>
<pre>
    "Then, glaring on his father with wild eyes,
     The son stood dumb, and spat upon his face,
     And clutched the unnatural sword&mdash;the father fled,
     And, wroth, as with the arm that missed a parent,
     The wretched man drove home unto his breast
     The abhorrent steel; yet ever, while dim sense
     Struggled within the fast-expiring soul&mdash;
     Feebler, and feebler still, his stiffening arms
     Clung to that virgin form&mdash;and every gasp
     Of his last breath with bloody dews distained
     The cold white cheek that was his pillow.  So
     Lies death embracing death!" <a href="#note-360" name="noteref-360"><small>360</small></a>
</pre>
<p>
In the midst of this description, by a fine stroke of art, Euridice,
the mother of Haemon, abruptly and silently quits the stage <a href="#note-361" name="noteref-361"><small>361</small></a>.
When next we hear of her, she has destroyed herself, with her last
breath cursing her husband as the murderer of her child.  The end of
the play leaves Creon the surviver.  He himself does not perish, for
he himself has never excited our sympathies <a href="#note-362" name="noteref-362"><small>362</small></a>.  He is punished
through his son and wife&mdash;they dead, our interest ceases in him, and
to add his death to theirs and to that of Antigone would be bathos.
</p>
<p>
VIII.  In the tragedy of "Electra," the character of the heroine
stands out in the boldest contrast to the creation of the Antigone;
both are endowed with surpassing majesty and strength of nature&mdash;they
are loftier than the daughters of men, their very loveliness is of an
age when gods were no distant ancestors of kings&mdash;when, as in the
early sculptors of Pallas, or even of Aphrodite, something of the
severe and stern was deemed necessary to the realization of the
divine; and the beautiful had not lost the colossal proportions of the
sublime.  But the strength and heroism of Antigone is derived from
love&mdash;love, sober, serene, august&mdash;but still love.  Electra, on the
contrary, is supported and exalted above her sex by the might of her
hatred.  Her father, "the king of men," foully murdered in his palace
&mdash;herself compelled to consort with his assassins&mdash;to receive from
their hands both charity and insult&mdash;the adulterous murderer on her
father's throne, and lord of her father's marriage bed <a href="#note-363" name="noteref-363"><small>363</small></a>&mdash;her
brother a wanderer and an outcast.  Such are the thoughts unceasingly
before her!&mdash;her heart and soul have for years fed upon the bitterness
of a resentment, at once impotent and intense, and nature itself has
turned to gall.  She sees not in Clytemnestra a mother, but the
murderess of a father.  The doubt and the compunction of the modern
Hamlet are unknown to her more masculine spirit.  She lives on but in
the hope of her brother's return and of revenge.  The play opens with
the appearance of Orestes, Pylades, and an old attendant&mdash;arrived at
break of day at the habitation of the Pelopidae&mdash;"reeking with blood"
&mdash;the seats of Agamemnon.  Orestes, who had been saved in childhood by
his sister from the designs of Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, has now
returned in manhood.  It is agreed that, in order to lull all
suspicion in the royal adulterers, a false account of the death of
Orestes by an accident in the Pythian Games shall be given to
Clytemnestra; and Orestes and Pylades themselves are afterward to be
introduced in the character of Phocians, bearing the ashes of the
supposed dead.  Meanwhile the two friends repair to the sepulchre of
Agamemnon to offer libations, etc.  Electra then appears, indulges her
indignant lamentations at her lot, and consoles herself with the hope
of her brother's speedy return.
</p>
<p>
She is joined by her sister Chrysothemis, who is bearing sepulchral
offerings to the tomb of Agamemnon; and in this interview Sophocles,
with extraordinary skill and deep knowledge of human nature, contrives
to excite our admiration and sympathy for the vehement Electra by
contrasting her with the weak and selfish Chrysothemis.  Her very
bitterness against her mother is made to assume the guise of a solemn
duty to her father.  Her unfeminine qualities rise into courage and
magnanimity&mdash;she glories in the unkindness and persecution she meets
with from Clytemnestra and Aegisthus&mdash;they are proofs of her reverence
to the dead.  Woman as she is, she is yet the daughter of a king&mdash;she
cannot submit to a usurper&mdash;"she will not, add cowardice to misery."
Chrysothemis informs Electra that on the return of Aegisthus it is
resolved to consign her to a vault "where she may chant her woes
unheard."  Electra learns the meditated sentence undismayed&mdash;she will
not moderate her unwelcome wo&mdash;"she will not be a traitoress to those
she loves."  But a dream has appalled Clytemnestra&mdash;Agamemnon has
appeared to her as in life.  In the vision he seemed to her to fix his
sceptre on the soil, whence it sprouted up into a tree that
overshadowed the whole land.  Disquieted and conscience-stricken, she
now sends Chrysothemis with libations to appease the manes of the
dead.  Electra adjures Chrysothemis not to render such expiations to
scatter them to the winds or on the dust&mdash;to let them not approach the
resting-place of the murdered king.  Chrysothemis promises to obey the
injunction, and departs.  A violent and powerful scene between
Clytemnestra and Electra ensues, when the attendant enters (as was
agreed on) to announce the death of Orestes.  In this recital he
portrays the ceremony of the Pythian races in lines justly celebrated,
and which, as an animated and faithful picture of an exhibition so
renowned, the reader may be pleased to see, even in a feeble and cold
translation.  Orestes had obtained five victories in the first day&mdash;in
the second he starts with nine competitors in the chariot-race&mdash;an
Achaean, a Spartan, two Libyans&mdash;he himself with Thessalian steeds&mdash;a
sixth from Aetolia, a Magnesian, an Enian, an Athenian, and a Boeotian
complete the number.
</p>
<pre>
    "They took their stand where the appointed judges
     Had cast their lots, and ranged the rival cars;
     Rang out the brazen trump!  Away they bound,
     Cheer the hot steeds and shake the slackened reins
     As with a body the large space is filled
     With the huge clangour of the rattling cars:
     High whirl aloft the dust-clouds; blent together
     Each presses each&mdash;and the lash rings&mdash;and loud
     Snort the wild steeds, and from their fiery breath,
     Along their manes and down the circling wheels,
     Scatter the flaking foam.  Orestes still,
     Ay, as he swept around the perilous pillar
     Last in the course, wheel'd in the rushing axle,
     The left rein curbed&mdash;that on the dexter hand
     Flung loose.  So on erect the chariots rolled!
     Sudden the Aenian's fierce and headlong steeds
     Broke from the bit&mdash;and, as the seventh time now
     The course was circled, on the Libyan car
     Dash'd their wild fronts: then order changed to ruin:
     Car crashed on car&mdash;the wide Crissaean plain
     Was, sealike, strewn with wrecks: the Athenian saw,
     Slackened his speed, and, wheeling round the marge,
     Unscathed and skilful, in the midmost space,
     Left the wild tumult of that tossing storm.
     Behind, Orestes, hitherto the last,
     Had yet kept back his coursers for the close;
     Now one sole rival left&mdash;on, on he flew,
     And the sharp sound of the impelling scourge
     Rang in the keen ears of the flying steeds.
     He nears&mdash;he reaches&mdash;they are side by side
     Now one&mdash;the other&mdash;by a length the victor.
     The courses all are past&mdash;the wheels erect
     All safe&mdash;when as the hurrying coursers round
     The fatal pillar dash'd, the wretched boy
     Slackened the left rein; on the column's edge
     Crash'd the frail axle&mdash;headlong from the car,
     Caught and all meshed within the reins he fell;
     And masterless, the mad steeds raged along!

     Loud from that mighty multitude arose
     A shriek&mdash;a shout!  But yesterday such deeds
     To-day such doom!  Now whirled upon the earth,
     Now his limbs dash'd aloft, they dragged him&mdash;those
     Wild horses&mdash;till all gory from the wheels
     Released&mdash;and no man, not his nearest friends,
     Could in that mangled corpse have traced Orestes.
     They laid the body on the funeral pyre,
     And while we speak, the Phocian strangers bear,
     In a small, brazen, melancholy urn,
     That handful of cold ashes to which all
     The grandeur of the beautiful hath shrunk.
     Hither they bear him&mdash;in his father's land
     To find that heritage&mdash;a tomb!"
</pre>
<p>
It is much to be regretted that this passage, so fine in the original,
is liable to one great objection&mdash;it has no interest as connected with
the play, because the audience know that Orestes is not dead; and
though the description of the race retains its animation, the report
of the catastrophe loses the terror of reality, and appears but a
highly-coloured and elaborate falsehood.
</p>
<p>
The reader will conceive the lamentations of Electra and the fearful
joy of Clytemnestra at a narrative by which the one appears to lose a
brother and a friend&mdash;the other a son and an avenging foe.
</p>
<p>
Chrysothemis joyfully returns to announce, that by the tomb of
Agamemnon she discovers a lock of hair; libations yet moisten the
summit of the mound, and flowers of every hue are scattered over the
grave.  "These," she thinks, "are signs that Orestes is returned."
Electra, informing her of the fatal news, proposes that they, women as
they are, shall attempt the terrible revenge which their brother can
no longer execute.  When Chrysothemis recoils and refuses, Electra
still nurses the fell design.  The poet has more than once, and now
again with judgment, made us sensible of the mature years of Electra
<a href="#note-364" name="noteref-364"><small>364</small></a>; she is no passionate, wavering, and inexperienced girl, but the
eldest born of the house; the guardian of the childhood of its male
heir; unwedded and unloving, no soft matron cares, no tender maiden
affections, have unbent the nerves of her stern, fiery, and
concentrated soul.  Year after year has rolled on to sharpen her
hatred&mdash;to disgust her with the present&mdash;to root her to one bloody
memory of the past&mdash;to sour and freeze up the gentle thoughts of
womanhood&mdash;to unsex
</p>
<pre>
    "And fill her from the crown to the toe, topful
     Of direst cruelty&mdash;make thick her blood
     Stop up the access and passage to remorse," <a href="#note-365" name="noteref-365"><small>365</small></a>
</pre>
<p>
and fit her for one crowning deed, for which alone the daughter of the
king of men lives on.
</p>
<p>
At length the pretended Phocians enter, bearing the supposed ashes of
Orestes; the chief of the train addresses himself to Electra, and this
is the most dramatic and touching scene in the whole tragedy.  When
the urn containing, as she believes, the dust of her brother, is
placed in the hands of Electra, we can well overleap time and space,
and see before us the great actor who brought the relics of his own
son upon the stage, and shed no mimic sorrows <a href="#note-366" name="noteref-366"><small>366</small></a>&mdash;we can well
picture the emotions that circle round the vast audience&mdash;pity itself
being mingled with the consciousness to which the audience alone are
admitted, that lamentation will soon be replaced by joy, and that the
living Orestes is before his sister.  It is by a most subtle and
delicate art that Sophocles permits this struggle between present pain
and anticipated pleasure, and carries on the passion of the spectators
to wait breathlessly the moment when Orestes shall be discovered.  We
now perceive why the poet at once, in the opening of the play,
announced to us the existence and return of Orestes&mdash;why he disdained
the vulgar source of interest, the gross suspense we should have felt,
if we had shared the ignorance of Electra, and not been admitted to
the secret we impatiently long to be communicated to her.  In this
scene, our superiority to Electra, in the knowledge we possess,
refines and softens our compassion, blending it with hope.  And most
beautifully here does Sophocles remove far from us the thought of the
hard hatred that hitherto animates the mourner&mdash;the strong, proud
spirit is melted away&mdash;the woman and the sister alone appear.  He whom
she had loved more dearly than a mother&mdash;whom she had nursed, and
saved, and prayed for, is "a nothing" in her hands; and the last rites
it had not been hers to pay.  He had been
</p>
<pre>
    "By strangers honoured and by strangers mourned."
</pre>
<p>
All things had vanished with him&mdash;"vanished in a day"&mdash;"vanished as by
a hurricane"&mdash;she is left with her foes alone.  "Admit me" (she
cries), "to thy refuge&mdash;make room for me in thy home."
</p>
<p>
In these lamentations, the cold, classic drama seems to warm into
actual life.  Art, exquisite because invisible, unites us at once with
imperishable nature&mdash;we are no longer delighted with Poetry&mdash;we are
weeping with Truth.
</p>
<p>
At length Orestes reveals himself, and now the plot draws to its
catastrophe.  Clytemnestra is alone in her house, preparing a caldron
for the burial; Electra and the chorus are on the stage; the son&mdash;the
avenger, is within; suddenly the cries of Clytemnestra are heard.
Again&mdash;again!  Orestes re-enters a parricide! <a href="#note-367" name="noteref-367"><small>367</small></a>  He retires as
Aegisthus is seen approaching; and the adulterous usurper is now
presented to us for the first and last time&mdash;the crowning victim of
the sacrifice.  He comes flushed with joy and triumph.  He has heard
that the dreaded Orestes is no more.  Electra entertains him a few
moments with words darkly and exultingly ambiguous.  He orders the
doors to be thrown open, that all Argos and Mycenae may see the
remains of his sole rival for the throne.  The scene opens.  On the
threshold (where, with the Greeks, the corpse of the dead was usually
set out to view) lies a body covered with a veil or pall.  Orestes
(the supposed Phocian) stands beside.
</p>
<pre>
    "Aegisthus.  Great Jove!  a grateful spectacle!&mdash;if thus
     May it be said unsinning; yet if she,
     The awful Nemesis, be nigh and hear,
     I do recall the sentence!  Raise the pall.
     The dead was kindred to me, and shall know
     A kinsman's sorrow.
       Orestes.           Lift thyself the pall;
     Not mine, but thine, the office to survey
     That which lies mute beneath, and to salute,
     Lovingly sad, the dead one.
       Aegisthus.                 Be it so&mdash;
     It is well said.  Go thou and call the queen:
     Is she within?
       Orestes.      Look not around for her&mdash;
     She is beside thee!"
</pre>
<p>
Aegisthus lifts the pall, and beholds the body of Clytemnestra!  He
knows his fate at once.  He knows that Orestes is before him.  He
attempts to speak.  The fierce Electra cuts him short, and Orestes,
with stern solemnity, conducts him from the stage to the spot on which
Aegisthus had slain Agamemnon, so that the murderer might die by the
son's hand in the place where the father fell.  Thus artistically is
the catastrophe not lessened in effect, but heightened, by removing
the deed of death from the scene&mdash;the poetical justice, in the calm
and premeditated selection of the place of slaughter, elevates what on
the modern stage would be but a spectacle of physical horror into the
deeper terror and sublimer gloom of a moral awe; and vindictive
murder, losing its aspect, is idealized and hallowed into religious
sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
IX.  Of the seven plays left to us, "The Trachiniae" is usually
considered the least imbued with the genius of Sophocles; and Schlegel
has even ventured on the conjecture, singularly destitute of even
plausible testimony, that Sophocles himself may not be the author.
The plot is soon told.  The play is opened by Deianira, the wife of
Hercules, who indulges in melancholy reflections on the misfortunes of
her youth, and the continual absence of her husband, of whom no
tidings have been heard for months.  She soon learns from her son,
Hyllus, that Hercules is said to be leading an expedition into Euboea;
and our interest is immediately excited by Deianira's reply, which
informs us that oracles had foretold that this was to be the crisis
<a href="#note-368" name="noteref-368"><small>368</small></a> in the life of Hercules&mdash;that he was now to enjoy rest from his
labours, either in a peaceful home or in the grave; and she sends
Hyllus to join his father, share his enterprise and fate.  The chorus
touchingly paint the anxious love of Deianira in the following lines:
</p>
<pre>
    "Thou, whom the starry-spangled Night did lull
       Into the sleep from which&mdash;her journey done
     Her parting steps awake thee&mdash;beautiful
       Fountain of flame, oh Sun!
     Say, on what seagirt strand, or inland shore
       (For earth is bared before thy solemn gaze),
       In orient Asia, or where milder rays
     Tremble on western waters, wandereth he
       Whom bright Alcmena bore?
     Ah! as some bird within a lonely nest
       The desolate wife puts sleep away with tears;
           And ever ills to be
       Haunting the absence with dim hosts of fears,
     Fond fancy shapes from air dark prophets of the breast."
</pre>
<p>
In her answer to the virgin chorus, Deianira weaves a beautiful
picture of maiden youth as a contrast to the cares and anxieties of
wedded life:
</p>
<pre>
    "Youth pastures in a valley of its own;
     The scorching sun, the rains and winds of Heaven,
     Mar not the calm&mdash;yet virgin of all care;
     But ever with sweet joys it buildeth up
     The airy halls of life."
</pre>
<p>
Deianira afterward receives fresh news of Hercules.  She gives way to
her joy.  Lichas, the herald, enters, and confides to her charge some
maidens whom the hero had captured.  Deianira is struck with
compassion for their lot, and with admiration of the noble bearing of
one of them, Iole.  She is about to busy herself in preparation for
their comfort, when she learns that Iole is her rival&mdash;the beloved
mistress of Hercules.  The jealousy evinced by Deianira is beautifully
soft and womanly <a href="#note-369" name="noteref-369"><small>369</small></a>.  Even in uttering a reproach on Hercules, she
says she cannot feel anger with him, yet how can she dwell in the same
house with a younger and fairer rival;
</p>
<pre>
    "She in whose years the flower that fades in mine
     Opens the leaves of beauty."
</pre>
<p>
Her affection, her desire to retain the love of the hero, suggests to
her remembrance a gift she had once received from a centaur who had
fallen by the shaft of Hercules.  The centaur had assured her that the
blood from his wound, if preserved, would exercise the charm of a
filter over the heart of Hercules, and would ever recall and fix upon
her his affection.  She had preserved the supposed charm&mdash;she steeps
with it a robe that she purposes to send to Hercules as a gift; but
Deianira, in this fatal resolve, shows all the timidity and sweetness
of her nature; she even questions if it be a crime to regain the heart
of her husband; she consults the chorus, who advise the experiment
(and here, it may be observed, that this is skilfully done, for it
conveys the excuse of Deianira, the chorus being, as it were, the
representative of the audience).  Accordingly, she sends the garment
by Lichas.  Scarce has the herald gone, ere Deianira is terrified by a
strange phenomenon: a part of the wool with which the supposed filter
had been applied to the garment was thrown into the sunlight, upon
which it withered away&mdash;"crumbling like sawdust"&mdash;while on the spot
where it fell a sort of venomous foam froths up.  While relating this
phenomenon to the chorus, her son, Hyllus, returns <a href="#note-370" name="noteref-370"><small>370</small></a>, and relates
the agonies of his father under the poisoned garment: he had indued
the robe on the occasion of solemn sacrifice, and all was rejoicing,
when,
</p>
<pre>
    "As from the sacred offering and the pile
     The flame broke forth,"
</pre>
<p>
the poison began to work, the tunic clung to the limbs of the hero,
glued as if by the artificer, and, in his agony and madness, Hercules
dashes Lichas, who brought him the fatal gift, down the rock, and is
now on his way home.  On hearing these news and the reproaches of her
son, Deianira steals silently away, and destroys herself upon the
bridal-bed.  The remainder of the play is very feeble.  Hercules is
represented in his anguish, which is but the mere raving of physical
pain; and after enjoining his son to marry Iole (the innocent cause of
his own sufferings), and to place him yet living upon his funeral
pyre, the play ends.
</p>
<p>
The beauty of the "Trachiniae" is in detached passages, in some
exquisite bursts by the chorus, and in the character of Deianira,
whose artifice to regain the love of her consort, unhappily as it
terminates, is redeemed by a meekness of nature, a delicacy of
sentiment, and an anxious, earnest, unreproachful devotion of conjugal
love, which might alone suffice to show the absurdity of modern
declamations on the debasement of women, and the absence of pure and
true love in that land from which Sophocles drew his experience.
</p>
<p>
X.  The "Ajax" is far superior to the "Trachiniae."  The subject is
one that none but a Greek poet could have thought of or a Greek
audience have admired.  The master-passion of a Greek was emulation&mdash;
the subject of the "Ajax" is emulation defeated.  He has lost to
Ulysses the prize of the arms of Achilles, and the shame of being
vanquished has deprived him of his senses.
</p>
<p>
In the fury of madness he sallies from his tent at night&mdash;slaughters
the flocks, in which his insanity sees the Greeks, whose award has
galled and humbled him&mdash;and supposes he has slain the Atridae and
captured Ulysses.  It is in this play that Sophocles has, to a certain
extent, attempted that most effective of all combinations in the hands
of a master&mdash;the combination of the ludicrous and the terrible <a href="#note-371" name="noteref-371"><small>371</small></a>:
as the chorus implies, "it is to laugh and to weep."  But when the
scene, opening, discovers Ajax sitting amid the slaughtered victims&mdash;
when that haughty hero awakens from his delirium&mdash;when he is aware
that he has exposed himself to the mockery and derision of his foes&mdash;
the effect is almost too painful even for tragedy.  In contrast to
Ajax is the soothing and tender Tecmessa.  The women of Sophocles are,
indeed, gifted with an astonishing mixture of majesty and sweetness.
After a very pathetic farewell with his young son, Ajax affects to be
reconciled to his lot, disguises the resolution he has formed, and by
one of those artful transitions of emotion which at once vary and
heighten interest on the stage, the chorus, before lamenting, bursts
into a strain of congratulation and joy.  The heavy affliction has
passed away&mdash;Ajax is restored.  The Nuntius arrives from the camp.
Calchas, the soothsayer, has besought Teucer, the hero's brother, not
to permit Ajax to quit his tent that day, for on that day only Minerva
persecutes him; and if he survive it, he may yet be preserved and
prosper.  But Ajax has already wandered away, none know whither.
Tecmessa hastens in search of him, and, by a very rare departure from
the customs of the Greek stage, the chorus follow.
</p>
<p>
Ajax appears again.  His passions are now calm and concentrated, but
they lead him on to death.  He has been shamed, dishonoured&mdash;he has
made himself a mockery to his foes.  Nobly to live or nobly to die is
the sole choice of a brave man.  It is characteristic of the Greek
temperament, that the personages of the Greek poetry ever bid a last
lingering and half-reluctant farewell to the sun.  There is a
magnificent fulness of life in those children of the beautiful West;
the sun is to them as a familiar friend&mdash;the affliction or the terror
of Hades is in the thought that its fields are sunless.  The orb which
animated their temperate heaven, which ripened their fertile earth, in
which they saw the type of eternal youth, of surpassing beauty, of
incarnate poetry&mdash;human in its associations, and yet divine in its
nature&mdash;is equally beloved and equally to be mourned by the maiden
tenderness of Antigone or the sullen majesty of Ajax.  In a Chaldaean
poem the hero would have bid farewell to the stars!
</p>
<p>
It is thus that Ajax concludes his celebrated soliloquy.
</p>
<pre>
    "And thou that mak'st high heaven thy chariot-course,
     Oh sun&mdash;when gazing on my father-land,
     Draw back thy golden rein, and tell my woes
     To the old man, my father&mdash;and to her
     Who nursed me at her bosom&mdash;my poor mother!
     There will be wailing through the echoing walls
     When&mdash;but away with thoughts like these!&mdash;the hour
     Brings on the ripening deed.  Death, death, look on me!
     Did I say death?&mdash;it was a waste of words;
     We shall be friends hereafter.
                                   'Tis the DAY,
     Present and breathing round me, and the car
     Of the sweet sun, that never shall again
     Receive my greeting!&mdash;henceforth time is sunless,
     And day a thing that is not!  Beautiful light,
     My Salamis&mdash;my country&mdash;and the floor
     Of my dear household hearth&mdash;and thou, bright Athens,
     Thou&mdash;for thy sons and I were boys together&mdash;
     Fountains and rivers, and ye Trojan plains,
     I loved ye as my fosterers&mdash;fare ye well!
     Take in these words, the last earth hears from Ajax&mdash;
     All else unspoken, in a spectre land
     I'll whisper to the dead!"
</pre>
<p>
Ajax perishes on his sword&mdash;but the interest of the play survives him.
For with the Greeks, burial rather than death made the great close of
life.  Teucer is introduced to us; the protector of the hero's remains
and his character, at once fierce and tender, is a sketch of
extraordinary power.  Agamemnon, on the contrary&mdash;also not presented
to us till after the death of Ajax&mdash;is but a boisterous tyrant <a href="#note-372" name="noteref-372"><small>372</small></a>.
Finally, by the generous intercession of Ulysses, who redeems his
character from the unfavourable conception we formed of him at the
commencement of the play, the funeral rites are accorded, and a
didactic and solemn moral from the chorus concludes the whole.
</p>
<p>
XI.  The "Philoctetes" has always been ranked by critics among the
most elaborate and polished of the tragedies of Sophocles.  In some
respects it deserves the eulogies bestowed on it.  But one great fault
in the conception will, I think, be apparent on the simple statement
of the plot.
</p>
<p>
Philoctetes, the friend and armour-bearer of Hercules, and the heir of
that hero's unerring shafts and bow, had, while the Grecian fleet
anchored at Chryse (a small isle in the Aegaean), been bitten in the
foot by a serpent; the pain of the wound was insufferable&mdash;the shrieks
and groans of Philoctetes disturbed the libations and sacrifices of
the Greeks.  And Ulysses and Diomed, when the fleet proceeded, left
him, while asleep, on the wild and rocky solitudes of Lemnos.  There,
till the tenth year of the Trojan siege, he dragged out an agonizing
life.  The soothsayer, Helenus, then declared that Troy could not fall
till Philoctetes appeared in the Grecian camp with the arrows and bow
of Hercules.  Ulysses undertakes to effect this object, and, with
Neoptolemus (son of Achilles), departs for Lemnos.  Here the play
opens.  A wild and desolate shore&mdash;a cavern with two mouths (so that
in winter there might be a double place to catch the sunshine, and in
summer a twofold entrance for the breeze), and a little fountain of
pure water, designate the abode of Philoctetes.
</p>
<p>
Agreeably to his character, it is by deceit and stratagem that Ulysses
is to gain his object.  Neoptolemus is to dupe him whom he has never
seen with professions of friendship and offers of services, and to
snare away the consecrated weapons.  Neoptolemus&mdash;whose character is a
sketch which Shakspeare alone could have bodied out&mdash;has all the
generous ardour and honesty of youth, but he has also its timid
irresolution&mdash;its docile submission to the great&mdash;its fear of the
censure of the world.  He recoils from the base task proposed to him;
he would prefer violence to fraud; yet he dreads lest, having
undertaken the enterprise, his refusal to act should be considered
treachery to his coadjutor.  It is with a deep and melancholy wisdom
that Ulysses, who seems to comtemplate his struggles with
compassionate and not displeased superiority, thus attempts to
reconcile the young man:
</p>
<pre>
    "Son of a noble sire!  I too, in youth,
     Had thy plain speech and thine impatient arm:
     But a stern test is time!  I have lived to see
     That among men the tools of power and empire
     Are subtle words&mdash;not deeds."
</pre>
<p>
Neoptolemus is overruled.  Ulysses withdraws, Philoctetes appears.
The delight of the lonely wretch on hearing his native language; on
seeing the son of Achilles&mdash;his description of his feelings when he
first found himself abandoned in the desert&mdash;his relation of the
hardships he has since undergone, are highly pathetic.  He implores
Neoptolemus to bear him away, and when the youth consents, he bursts
into an exclamation of joy, which, to the audience, in the secret of
the perfidy to be practised on him, must have excited the most lively
emotions.  The characteristic excellence of Sophocles is, that in his
most majestic creations he always contrives to introduce the sweetest
touches of humanity.&mdash;Philoctetes will not even quit his miserable
desert until he has returned to his cave to bid it farewell&mdash;to kiss
the only shelter that did not deny a refuge to his woes.  In the joy
of his heart he thinks, poor dupe, that he has found faith in man&mdash;in
youth.  He trusts the arrows and the bow to the hand of Neoptolemus.
Then, as he attempts to crawl along, the sharp agony of his wound
completely overmasters him.  He endeavours in vain to stifle his
groans; the body conquers the mind.  This seems to me, as I shall
presently again observe, the blot of the play; it is a mere exhibition
of physical pain.  The torture exhausts, till insensibility or sleep
comes over him.  He lies down to rest, and the young man watches over
him.  The picture is striking.  Neoptolemus, at war with himself, does
not seize the occasion.  Philoctetes wakes.  He is ready to go on
board; he implores and urges instant departure.  Neoptolemus recoils&mdash;
the suspicions of Philoctetes are awakened; he thinks that this
stranger, too, will abandon him.  At length the young man, by a
violent effort, speaks abruptly out, "Thou must sail to Troy&mdash;to the
Greeks&mdash;the Atridae."
</p>
<p>
"The Greeks&mdash;the Atridae!" the betrayers of Philoctetes&mdash;those beyond
pardon&mdash;those whom for ten years he has pursued with the curses of a
wronged, and deserted, and solitary spirit.  "Give me back," he cries,
"my bow and arrows."  And when Neoptolemus refuses, he pours forth a
torrent of reproach.  The son of the truth&mdash;telling Achilles can
withstand no longer.  He is about to restore the weapons, when Ulysses
rushes on the stage and prevents him.
</p>
<p>
At length, the sufferer is to be left&mdash;left once more alone in the
desert.  He cannot go with his betrayers&mdash;he cannot give glory and
conquest to his inhuman foes; in the wrath of his indignant heart even
the desert is sweeter than the Grecian camp.  And how is he to sustain
himself without his shafts!  Famine adds a new horror to his dreary
solitude, and the wild beasts may now pierce into his cavern: but
their cruelty would be mercy!  His contradictory and tempestuous
emotions, as the sailors that compose the chorus are about to depart,
are thus told.
</p>
<p>
The chorus entreat him to accompany them.
</p>
<pre>
    Phil.  Begone.
    Chor.           It is a friendly bidding&mdash;we obey&mdash;
  Come, let us go.  To ship, my comrades.
    Phil.                                  No&mdash;
  No, do not go&mdash;by the great Jove, who hears
  Men's curses&mdash;do not go.
    Chor.                   Be calm.
    Phil.                             Sweet strangers!
  In mercy, leave me not.

       *     *     *     *     *     *

    Chor.  But now you bade us!
    Phil.                        Ay&mdash;meet cause for chiding,
  That a poor desperate wretch, maddened with pain,
  Should talk as madmen do!
    Chor.                    Come, then, with us.
    Phil.  Never! oh&mdash;never!  Hear me&mdash;not if all
  The lightnings of the thunder-god were made
  Allies with you, to blast me!  Perish Troy,
  And all beleaguered round its walls&mdash;yea; all
  Who had the heart to spurn a wounded wretch;
  But, but&mdash;nay&mdash;yes&mdash;one prayer, one boon accord me.
    Chor.  What wouldst thou have?
    Phil.                           A sword, an axe, a something;
  So it can strike, no matter!
    Chor.                       Nay&mdash;for what?
    Phil.  What! for this hand to hew me off this head&mdash;
  These limbs!  To death, to solemn death, at last
  My spirit calls me.
    Chor.              Why?
    Phil.                    To seek my father.
    Chor.        On earth?
    Phil.                   In Hades.
</pre>
<p>
Having thus worked us up to the utmost point of sympathy with the
abandoned Philoctetes, the poet now gradually sheds a gentler and
holier light over the intense gloom to which we had been led.
Neoptolemus, touched with generous remorse, steals back to give the
betrayed warrior his weapons&mdash;he is watched by the vigilant Ulysses&mdash;
an angry altercation takes place between them.  Ulysses, finding he
cannot intimidate, prudently avoids personal encounter with the son of
Achilles, and departs to apprize the host of the backsliding of his
comrade.&mdash;A most beautiful scene, in which Neoptolemus restores the
weapons to Philoctetes&mdash;a scene which must have commanded the most
exquisite tears and the most rapturous applauses of the audience,
ensues; and, finally, the god so useful to the ancient poets brings
all things, contrary to the general rule of Aristotle <a href="#note-373" name="noteref-373"><small>373</small></a>, to a
happy close.  Hercules appears and induces his former friend to
accompany Neoptolemus to the Grecian camp, where his wound shall be
healed..  The farewell of Philoctetes to his cavern&mdash;to the nymphs of
the meadows&mdash;to the roar of the ocean, whose spray the south wind
dashed through his rude abode&mdash;to the Lycian stream and the plain of
Lemnos&mdash;is left to linger on the ear like a solemn hymn, in which the
little that is mournful only heightens the majestic sweetness of all
that is musical.  The dramatic art in the several scenes of this play
Sophocles has never excelled, and scarcely equalled.  The contrast of
character in Ulysses and Neoptolemus has in it a reality, a human
strength and truth, that is more common to the modern than the ancient
drama.  But still the fault of the story is partly that the plot rests
upon a base and ignoble fraud, and principally that our pity is
appealed to by the coarse sympathy with physical pain: the rags that
covered the sores, the tainted corruption of the ulcers, are brought
to bear, not so much on the mind as on the nerves; and when the hero
is represented as shrinking with corporeal agony&mdash;the blood oozing
from his foot, the livid sweat rolling down the brow&mdash;we sicken and
turn away from the spectacle; we have no longer that pleasure in our
own pain which ought to be the characteristic of true tragedy.  It is
idle to vindicate this error by any dissimilarity between ancient and
modern dramatic art.  As nature, so art, always has some universal and
permanent laws.  Longinus rightly considers pathos a part of the
sublime, for pity ought to elevate us; but there is nothing to elevate
us in the noisome wounds, even of a mythical hero; our human nature is
too much forced back into itself&mdash;and a proof that in this the ancient
art did not differ from the modern, is in the exceeding rarity with
which bodily pain is made the instrument of compassion with the Greek
tragedians.  The Philoctetes and the Hercules are among the exceptions
that prove the rule. <a href="#note-374" name="noteref-374"><small>374</small></a>
</p>
<p>
XII.  Another drawback to our admiration of the Philoctetes is in the
comparison it involuntarily courts with the Prometheus of Aeschylus.
Both are examples of fortitude under suffering&mdash;of the mind's conflict
with its fate.  In either play a dreary waste, a savage solitude,
constitute the scene.  But the towering sublimity of the Prometheus
dwarfs into littleness every image of hero or demigod with which we
contrast it.  What are the chorus of mariners, and the astute Ulysses,
and the boyish generosity of Neoptolemus&mdash;what is the lonely cave on
the shores of Lemnos&mdash;what the high-hearted old warrior, with his
torturing wound and his sacred bow&mdash;what are all these to the vast
Titan, whom the fiends chain to the rock beneath which roll the rivers
of hell, for whom the daughters of Ocean are ministers, to whose
primeval birth the gods of Olympus are the upstarts of a day, whose
soul is the treasure-house of a secret which threatens the realm of
heaven, and for whose unimaginable doom earth reels to its base, all
the might of divinity is put forth, and Hades itself trembles as it
receives its indomitable and awful guest!  Yet, as I have before
intimated, it is the very grandeur of Aeschylus that must have made
his poems less attractive on the stage than those of the humane and
flexible Sophocles.  No visible representation can body forth his
thoughts&mdash;they overpower the imagination, but they do not come home to
our household and familiar feelings.  In the contrast between the
"Philoctetes" and the "Prometheus" is condensed the contrast between
Aeschylus and Sophocles.  They are both poets of the highest
conceivable order; but the one seems almost above appeal to our
affections&mdash;his tempestuous gloom appals the imagination, the vivid
glare of his thoughts pierces the innermost recesses of the intellect,
but it is only by accident that he strikes upon the heart.  The other,
in his grandest flights, remembers that men make his audience, and
seems to feel as if art lost the breath of its life when aspiring
beyond the atmosphere of human intellect and human passions.  The
difference between the creations of Aeschylus and Sophocles is like
the difference between the Satan of Milton and the Macbeth of
Shakspeare.  Aeschylus is equally artful with Sophocles&mdash;it is the
criticism of ignorance that has said otherwise.  But there is this
wide distinction&mdash;Aeschylus is artful as a dramatist to be read,
Sophocles as a dramatist to be acted.  If we get rid of actors, and
stage, and audience, Aeschylus will thrill and move us no less than
Sophocles, through a more intellectual if less passionate medium.  A
poem may be dramatic, yet not theatrical&mdash;may have all the effects of
the drama in perusal, but by not sufficiently enlisting the skill of
the actor&mdash;nay, by soaring beyond the highest reach of histrionic
capacities, may lose those effects in representation.  The storm in
"Lear" is a highly dramatic agency when our imagination is left free
to conjure up the angry elements,
</p>
<pre>
    "Bid the winds blow the earth into the sea,
     Or swell the curled waters."
</pre>
<p>
But a storm on the stage, instead of exceeding, so poorly mimics the
reality, that it can never realize the effect which the poet designs,
and with which the reader is impressed.  So is it with supernatural
and fanciful creations, especially of the more delicate and subtle
kind.  The Ariel of the "Tempest," the fairies of the "Midsummer
Night's Dream," and the Oceanides of the "Prometheus," are not to be
represented by human shapes.  We cannot say that they are not
dramatic, but they are not theatrical.  We can sympathize with the
poet, but not with the actor.  For the same reason, in a lesser
degree, all creations, even of human character, that very highly task
the imagination, that lift the reader wholly out of actual experience,
and above the common earth, are comparatively feeble when reduced to
visible forms.  The most metaphysical plays of Shakspeare are the
least popular in representation.  Thus the very genius of Aeschylus,
that kindles us in the closet, must often have militated against him
on the stage.  But in Sophocles all&mdash;even the divinities themselves&mdash;
are touched with humanity; they are not too subtle or too lofty to be
submitted to mortal gaze.  We feel at once that on the stage Sophocles
ought to have won the prize from Aeschylus; and, as a proof of this,
if we look at the plays of each, we see that scarcely any of the great
characters of Aeschylus could have called into sufficient exercise the
powers of an actor.  Prometheus on his rock, never changing even his
position, never absent from the scene, is denied all the relief, the
play and mobility, that an actor needs.  His earthly representative
could be but a grand reciter.  In the "Persians," not only the
theatrical, but the dramatic effect is wanting&mdash;it is splendid poetry
put into various mouths, but there is no collision of passions, no
surprise, no incident, no plot, no rapid dialogue in which words are
but the types of emotions.  In the "Suppliants" Garrick could have
made nothing of Pelasgus.  In the "Seven before Thebes" there are not
above twenty or thirty lines in the part of Eteocles in which the art
of the actor could greatly assist the genius of the poet.  In the'
trilogy of the "Agamemnon," the "Choephori," and the "Orestes,"
written in advanced years, we may trace the contagious innovation of
Sophocles; but still, even in these tragedies, there is no part so
effective in representation as those afforded by the great characters
of Sophocles.  In the first play the hypocrisy and power of
Clytemnestra would, it is true, have partially required and elicited
the talents of the player; but Agamemnon himself is but a thing of
pageant, and the splendid bursts of Cassandra might have been
effectively uttered by a very inferior histrionic artist.  In the
second play, in the scene between Orestes and his mother, and in the
gathering madness of Orestes, the art of the poet would unquestionably
task to the uttermost the skill of the performer.  But in the last
play (the Furies), perhaps the sublimest poem of the three, which
opens so grandly with the parricide at the sanctuary, and the Furies
sleeping around him, there is not one scene from the beginning to the
end in which an eminent actor could exhibit his genius.
</p>
<p>
But when we come to the plays of Sophocles, we feel that a new era in
the drama is created; we feel that the artist poet has called into
full existence the artist actor.  His theatrical effects <a href="#note-375" name="noteref-375"><small>375</small></a> are
tangible, actual&mdash;could be represented to-morrow in Paris&mdash;in London&mdash;
everywhere.  We find, therefore, that with Sophocles has passed down
to posterity the name of the great actor <a href="#note-376" name="noteref-376"><small>376</small></a> in his principal plays.
And I think the English reader, even in the general analysis and
occasional translations with which I have ventured to fill so many
pages, will perceive that all the exertions of subtle, delicate, and
passionate power, even in a modern actor, would be absolutely
requisite to do justice to the characters of Oedipus at Coloneus,
Antigone, Electra, and Philoctetes.
</p>
<p>
This, then, was the distinction between Aeschylus and Sophocles&mdash;both
were artists, as genius always must be, but the art of the latter
adapts itself better to representation.  And this distinction in art
was not caused merely by precedence in time.  Had Aeschylus followed
Sophocles, it would equally have existed&mdash;it was the natural
consequence of the distinctions in their genius&mdash;the one more sublime,
the other more impassioned&mdash;the one exalting the imagination, the
other appealing to the heart.  Aeschylus is the Michael Angelo of the
drama, Sophocles the Raffaele.
</p>
<p>
XIII.  Thus have I presented to the general reader the outline of all
the tragedies of Sophocles.  In the great length at which I have
entered in this, not the least difficult, part of my general task, I
have widely innovated on the plan pursued by the writers of Grecian
history.  For this innovation I offer no excuse.  It is her poetry at
the period we now examine, as her philosophy in a later time, that
makes the individuality of Athens.  In Sophocles we behold the age of
Pericles.  The wars of that brilliant day were as pastimes to the
mighty carnage of oriental or northern battle.  The reduction of a
single town, which, in our time, that has no Sophocles and no
Pericles, a captain of artillery would demolish in a week, was the
proudest exploit of the Olympian of the Agora; a little while, and one
defeat wrests the diadem of the seas from the brows of "The Violet
Queen;" scanty indeed the ruins that attest the glories of "The
Propylaea, the Parthenon, the Porticoes, and the Docks," to which the
eloquent orator appealed as the "indestructible possessions" of
Athens; along the desolate site of the once tumultuous Agora the
peasant drives his oxen&mdash;the champion deity <a href="#note-377" name="noteref-377"><small>377</small></a> of Phidias, whose
spectral apparition daunted the barbarian Alaric <a href="#note-378" name="noteref-378"><small>378</small></a>, and the gleam
of whose spear gladdened the mariner beneath the heights of Sunium,
has vanished from the Acropolis; but, happily, the age of Pericles has
its stamp and effigy in an art more imperishable than that of war&mdash;in
materials more durable than those of bronze and marble, of ivory and
gold.  In the majestic harmony, the symmetrical grace of Sophocles, we
survey the true portraiture of the genius of the times, and the old
man of Coloneus still celebrates the name of Athens in a sweeter song
than that of the nightingale <a href="#note-379" name="noteref-379"><small>379</small></a>, and melodies that have survived
the muses of Cephisus <a href="#note-380" name="noteref-380"><small>380</small></a>.  Sophocles was allegorically the prophet
when he declared that in the grave of Oedipus was to be found the
sacred guardian and the everlasting defence of the city of Theseus.

[  Nepos says the fine was estimated at the cost of the navy he had
conducted to Paros; but Boeckh rightly observes, that it is an
ignorant assertion of that author that the fine was intended for a
compensation, being the usual mode of assessing the offence.
</p>
<p>
The case is simply this&mdash;Miltiades was accused&mdash;whether justly or
unjustly no matter&mdash;it was clearly as impossible not to receive the
accusation and to try the cause, as it would be for an English court
of justice to refuse to admit a criminal action against Lord Grey or
the Duke of Wellington.  Was Miltiades guilty or not?  This we cannot
tell.  We know that he was tried according to the law, and that the
Athenians thought him guilty, for they condemned him.  So far this is
not ingratitude&mdash;it is the course of law.  A man is tried and found
guilty&mdash;if past services and renown were to save the great from
punishment when convicted of a state offence, society would perhaps be
disorganized, and certainly a free state would cease to exist.  The
question therefore shrinks to this&mdash;was it or was it not ungrateful in
the people to relax the penalty of death, legally incurred, and
commute it to a heavy fine?  I fear we shall find few instances of
greater clemency in monarchies, however mild.  Miltiades unhappily
died.  But nature slew him, not the Athenian people.  And it cannot be
said with greater justice of the Athenians, than of a people no less
illustrious, and who are now their judges, that it was their custom
"de tuer en amiral pour encourager les autres."

[  The taste of a people, which is to art what public opinion is to
legislation, is formed, like public opinion, by habitual social
intercourse and collision.  The more men are brought together to
converse and discuss, the more the principles of a general national
taste will become both diffused and refined.  Less to their climate,
to their scenery, to their own beauty of form, than to their social
habits and preference of the public to the domestic life, did the
Athenians, and the Grecian republics generally, owe that wonderful
susceptibility to the beautiful and harmonious, which distinguishes
them above all nations ancient or modern.  Solitude may exalt the

[  In these remarks upon the origin of the drama, it would belong
less to history than to scholastic dissertation, to enter into all the
disputed and disputable points.  I do not, therefore, pause with every
step to discuss the questions contested by antiquarians&mdash;such as,
whether the word "tragedy," in its primitive and homely sense,
together with the prize of the goat, was or was not known in Attica
prior to Thespis (it seems to me that the least successful part of
Bentley's immortal work is that which attempts to enforce the latter
proposition); still less do I think a grave answer due to those who,
in direct opposition to authorities headed by the grave and searching
Aristotle, contend that the exhibitions of Thespis were of a serious
and elevated character.  The historian must himself weigh the
evidences on which he builds his conclusions; and come to those
conclusions, especially in disputes which bring to unimportant and
detached inquiries the most costly expenditure of learning, without
fatiguing the reader with a repetition of all the arguments which he
accepts or rejects.  For those who incline to go more deeply into
subjects connected with the early Athenian drama, works by English and
German authors, too celebrated to enumerate, will be found in
abundance.  But even the most careless general reader will do well to
delight himself with that dissertation of Bentley on Phalaris, so
familiar to students, and which, despite some few intemperate and bold
assumptions, will always remain one of the most colossal monuments of
argument and erudition.

that these plays were written after Sophocles had introduced the third
actor.  [Footnote The Orestean tetralogy was exhibited B. C. 455, only two
years before the death of Aeschylus, and ten years after Sophocles had
gained his first prize.:  Any number of mutes might be admitted, not

obtained, Zopyrus was enabled to betray the city to the king.  This
cold-blooded and treacherous immolation of seven thousand subjects was
considered by the humane Darius and the Persians generally a proof of
the most illustrious virtue in Zopyrus, who received for it the reward
of the satrapy of Babylon.  The narrative is so circumstantial as to
bear internal evidence of its general truth.  In fact, a Persian would

peril, it was not while the Athenians were still in the camp that they
would have conceived all the petty envies of the forum.  The
jealousies Themistocles excited were of much later date.  It is

disputes the date for the archonship of Themistocles given by Mr.
Clinton and confirmed by the scholiast on Thucydides.  He adopts (page
366) the date which M. Boeckh founds upon Philochorus, viz., B. C.
493.  But the Themistocles who was archon in that year is evidently
another person from the Themistocles of Salamis; for in 493 that hero
was about twenty-one, an age at which the bastard of Neocles might be
driving courtesans in a chariot (as is recorded in Athenaeus), but was
certainly not archon of Athens.  As for M. Boeckh's proposed
emendation, quoted so respectfully by Mr. Thirlwall, by which we are
to read Hybrilidon for Kebridos, it is an assumption so purely
fanciful as to require no argument for refusing it belief.  Mr.
Clinton's date for the archonship of the great Themistocles is the one
most supported by internal evidence&mdash;1st, by the blanks of the years
481-482 in the list of archons; 2dly, by the age, the position, and
repute of Themistocles in B. C. 481, two years after the ostracism of
his rival Aristides.  If it were reduced to a mere contest of
probabilities between Mr. Clinton on one side and Mr. Boeckh and Mr.
Thirlwall on the other, which is the more likely, that Themistocles
should have been chief archon of Athens at twenty-one or at
thirty-three&mdash;before the battle of Marathon or after his triumph over
Aristides?  In fact, a schoolboy knows that at twenty-one (and
Themistocles was certainly not older in 493) no Athenian could have
been archon.  In all probability Kebridos is the right reading in
Philochorus, and furnishes us with the name of the archon in B. C. 487
or 486, which years have hitherto been chronological blanks, so far as

disdain to cite it, but also because it is evident, from the speech of
Nicias, in the Knights of Aristophanes, i. 83, 84, that in the time of
Pericles it was popularly believed by the Athenians that Themistocles
died by poison; and from motives that rendered allusion to his death a
popular claptrap.  It is also clear that the death of Themistocles
appears to have reconciled him at once to the Athenians.  The previous
suspicions of his fidelity to Greece do not seem to have been kept
alive even by the virulence of party; and it is natural to suppose
that it must have been some act of his own, real or imagined, which
tended to disprove the plausible accusations against him, and revive
the general enthusiasm in his favour.  What could that act have been
but the last of his life, which, in the lines of Aristophanes referred
to above, is cited as the ideal of a glorious death!  But if he died
by poison, the draught was not bullock's blood&mdash;the deadly nature of
which was one of the vulgar fables of the ancients.  In some parts of
the continent it is, in this day, even used as medicine.

Ephialtes, who at that time was the leader of his party, and far more
influential than Pericles himself.  Plato (ap. Plut. in vit. Peric.)
rightly considers Ephialtes the true overthrower of the Areopagus; and

[  Certain German historians, Mueller among others, have built
enormous conclusions upon the smallest data, when they suppose Cimon
was implicated in this conspiracy.  Meirs (Historia Juris de bonis
Damnatis, p. 4, note 11) is singularly unsuccessful in connecting the
supposed fine of fifty talents incurred by Cimon with the civil
commotions of this period.  In fact, that Cimon was ever fined at all
is very improbable; the supposition rests upon most equivocal ground:
if adopted, it is more likely, perhaps, that the fine was inflicted
after his return from Thasos, when he was accused of neglecting the
honour of the Athenian arms, and being seduced by Macedonian gold (a
charge precisely of a nature for which a fine would have been
incurred).  But the whole tale of this imaginary fine, founded upon a
sentence in Demosthenes, who, like many orators, was by no means
minutely accurate in historical facts, is possibly nothing more than a
confused repetition of the old story of the fine of fifty talents (the
same amount) imposed upon Miltiades, and really paid by Cimon.  This
is doubly, and, indeed, indisputably clear, if we accept Becker's
reading of Parion for patrion in the sentence of Demosthenes referred

Andocides, Cimon was residing on his patrimonial estates in the

the sovereignty of this colony, and as it was a most important
position as respected the recent Athenian conquests under Cimon
himself, the assertion, if true, will show that Cimon's ostracism was
attended with no undue persecution.  Had the government seriously
suspected him of any guilty connivance with the oligarchic
conspirators, it could scarcely have permitted him to remain in a
colony, the localities of which were peculiarly favourable to any

invested with the foreign command of Cyprus, and Pericles remain the
head of the domestic government.  But it was not until the sixth year

husbands to the house of Aspasia (and it was certainly a popular
charge against Pericles that Aspasia served to corrupt the Athenian
matrons), they could not have been so jealously confined as writers,

[  For the transfer itself there were excuses yet more plausible
than that assigned by Justin.  First, in the year following the breach
between the Spartans and Athenians (B. C. 460), probably the same year
in which the transfer was effected, the Athenians were again at war
with the great king in Egypt; and there was therefore a show of
justice in the argument noticed by Boeckh (though in the source whence
he derives it the argument applies to the earlier time of Aristides),
that the transfer provided a place of greater security against the
barbarians.  Secondly, Delos itself was already and had long been
under Athenian influence.  Pisistratus had made a purification of the
island [Footnote Herod., lib. i., c. 64:, Delian soothsayers had predicted to
Athens the sovereignty of the seas [Footnote Semius Delius, ap. Athen., viii.:,
and the Athenians seem to have arrogated a right of interference with
the temple.  The transfer was probably, therefore, in appearance,
little more than a transfer from a place under the power of Athens to
Athens itself.  Thirdly, it seems that when the question was first
agitated, during the life of Aristides, it was at the desire of one of
the allies themselves (the Samians).  [Footnote Plut. in vit. Aristid.  Boeckh
(vol. i., 135, translation) has no warrant for supposing that Pericles
influenced the Samians in the expression of this wish, because
Plutarch refers the story to the time of Aristides, during whose life
Pericles possessed no influence in public affairs.:

[  A brilliant writer in the Edinburgh Review (Mr. Macauley) would
account for the use of dialogue in Herodotus by the childish
simplicity common to an early and artless age&mdash;as the boor always
unconsciously resorts to the dramatic form of narration, and relates
his story by a series of "says he's" and "says I's."  But does not Mr.
Macauley, in common with many others, insist far too much on the
artlessness of the age and the unstudied simplicity of the writer?
Though history itself was young, art was already at its zenith.  It
was the age of Sophocles, Phidias, and Pericles.  It was from the
Athenians, in their most polished period, that Herodotus received the
most rapturous applause.  Do not all accounts of Herodotus, as a
writer, assure us that he spent the greater part of a long life in
composing, polishing, and perfecting his history; and is it not more
in conformity with the characteristic spirit of the times, and the
masterly effects which Herodotus produces, to conclude, that what we
suppose to be artlessness was, in reality, the premeditated
elaboration of art?

[  It must ever remain a disputable matter how far the Ionian
Pythagoras was influenced by affection for Dorian policy and customs,
and how far he designed to create a state upon the old Dorian model.
On the one hand, it is certain that he paid especial attention to the
rites and institutions most connected with the Dorian deity, Apollo&mdash;
that, according to his followers, it was from that god that he derived
his birth, a fiction that might be interpreted into a Dorian origin;
he selected Croton as his residence, because it was under the
protection of "his household god;" his doctrines are said to have been
delivered in the Dorian dialect; and much of his educational
discipline, much of his political system, bear an evident affinity to
the old Cretan and Spartan institutions.  But, on the other hand, it
is probable, that Pythagoras favoured the god of Delphi, partly from
the close connexion which many of his symbols bore to the metaphysical
speculations the philosopher had learned to cultivate in the schools
of oriental mysticism, and partly from the fact that Apollo was the
patron of the medical art, in which Pythagoras was an eminent
professor.  And in studying the institutions of Crete and Sparta, he
might rather have designed to strengthen by examples the system he had
already adopted, than have taken from those Dorian cities the
primitive and guiding notions of the constitution he afterward
established.  And in this Pythagoras might have resembled most
reformers, not only of his own, but of all ages, who desire to go back
to the earliest principles of the past as the sources of experience to
the future.  In the Dorian institutions was preserved the original
character of the Hellenic nation; and Pythagoras, perhaps, valued or
consulted them less because they were Dorian than because they were
ancient.  It seems, however, pretty clear, that in the character of
his laws he sought to conform to the spirit and mode of legislation
already familiar in Italy, since Charondas and Zaleucus, who
flourished before him, are ranked by Diodorus and others among his
disciples.

confederates, such as Thebes, Elis, and Argos.  But on account of the
remoteness of many countries, it is impossible that every trifle could
have been brought before the court at Athens; we must therefore
suppose that each subject state had an inferior jurisdiction of its
own, and that the supreme jurisdiction alone belonged to Athens.  Can
it, indeed, be supposed that persons would have travelled from Rhodes
or Byzantium, for the sake of a lawsuit of fifty or a hundred
drachmas?  In private suits a sum of money was probably fixed, above
which the inferior court of the allies had no jurisdiction, while

only existed ten years when brought to Athens: whereas it had existed
about seventeen, viz., from B. C. 477 to B. C. 461, or rather B. C.

p. 38 (viz., nearly 8000 talents), though he afterward raises it to
10,000.  But a large portion of it must have been consumed in war
before the transfer.  Still Boeckh rates the total of the sum
transferred far too low, when he says it cannot have exceeded 1800

unequally assessed, if it were really the pecuniary hardship the
allies insisted upon and complained of.  But the resistance made to
imposts upon matters of feeling or principle in our own country, as,
at this day, in the case of church-rates, may show the real nature of
the grievance.  It was not the amount paid, but partly the degradation
of paying it, and partly, perhaps, resentment in many places at some
unfair assessment.  Discontent exaggerates every burden, and a feather
is as heavy as a mountain when laid on unwilling shoulders.  When the
new arrangement was made by Alcibiades or the later demagogues,
Andocides asserts that some of the allies left their native countries
and emigrated to Thurii.  But how many Englishmen have emigrated to
America from objections to a peculiar law or a peculiar impost, which
state policy still vindicates, or state necessity still maintains!
The Irish Catholic peasant, in reality, would not, perhaps, be much
better off, in a pecuniary point of view, if the tithes were
transferred to the rental of the landlord, yet Irish Catholics have
emigrated in hundreds from the oppression, real or imaginary, of
Protestant tithe-owners.  Whether in ancient times or modern, it is
not the amount of taxation that makes the grievance.  People will pay
a pound for what they like, and grudge a farthing for what they hate.

before the expiration of he sentence, and appointed to command, at the
very period when the power and influence of Pericles were at their
height.  Thucydides, the historian, was about thirty-one, an age at
which so high a command would scarcely, at that period, have been
bestowed upon any citizen, even in Athens, where men mixed in public
affairs earlier than in other Hellenic states [Footnote Thucydides himself
(lib. v., 43) speaks of Alcibiades as a mere youth (at least one who
would have been so considered in any other state), at a time when he
could not have been much less, and was probably rather more than
thirty:; besides, had Thucydides been present, would he have given us
no more ample details of an event so important?  There were several
who bore this name.  The scholiast on Aristophanes (Acharn., v., 703)
says there were four, whom he distinguishes thus&mdash;1st, the historian;
2d, the Gargettian; 3d, the Thessalian; 4th, the son of Melesias.  The
scholiast on the Vespae (v., 991) enumerates the same, and calls them
all Athenians.  The son of Melesias is usually supposed the opponent
of Pericles&mdash;he is so called by Androtion.  Theopompus, however, says
that it was the son of Pantanus.  Marcellinus (in vit. Thucyd., p.
xi.) speaks of many of the name, and also selects four for special
notice.  1st, the historian; 2d, the son of Melesias; 3d, a
Pharsalian; 4th, a poet of the ward of Acherdus, mentioned by
Androtion, and called the son of Ariston.  Two of this name, the
historian and the son of Melesias, are well known to us; but, for the
reasons I have mentioned, it is more probable that one of the others
was general in the Samian war.  A third Thucydides (the Thessalian or
Pharsalian) is mentioned by the historian himself (viii., 92).  I take
the Gargettian (perhaps the son of Pantanus named by Theopompus) to
have been the commander in the expedition.

scientific actor of the noblest tragedies."  Gellius relates of him an
anecdote, that when acting the Electra of Sophocles, in that scene
where she is represented with the urn supposed to contain her
brother's remains, he brought on the stage the urn and the relics of
his own son, so that his lamentations were those of real emotion.
Poles acted the hero in the plays of Oedipus Tyrannus and Oedipus at
Coloneus.&mdash;Arrian. ap. Stob., xcvii., 28.  The actors were no less
important personages on the ancient than they are on the modern stage.
Aristotle laments that good poets were betrayed into episodes, or
unnecessarily prolonging and adorning parts not wanted in the plot, so
as to suit the rival performers.&mdash;Arist. de Poet., ix.  Precisely what
is complained of in the present day.  The Attic performers were the
best in Greece&mdash;all the other states were anxious to engage them, but
they were liable to severe penalties if they were absent at the time
of the Athenian festivals.  (Plut. in Alex.)  They were very highly
remunerated.  Polus could earn no less than a talent in two days
(Plut. in Rhet. vit.), a much larger sum (considering the relative
values of money) than any English actor could now obtain for a
proportionate period of service.  Though in the time of Aristotle
actors as a body were not highly respectable, there was nothing highly
derogatory in the profession itself.  The high birth of Sophocles and
Aeschylus did not prevent their performing in their own plays.  Actors
often took a prominent part in public affairs; and Aristodemus, the
player, was sent ambassador to King Philip.  So great, indeed, was the
importance attached to this actor, that the state took on itself to
send ambassadors in his behalf to all the cities in which he had
engagements.&mdash;Aeschin. de Fals. Legat., p. 30-203, ed. Reiske.
